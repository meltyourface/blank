To begin our deep dive into this complex knowledge challenge, it is essential to break down the question in its components and define some key terms to ensure we have a thorough understanding of the matter at hand.

1. **Adept**: An individual deeply immersed in the esoteric and occult practices, who has acquired significant experience and knowledge in these fields.
2. **Ancestral Retinue**: Lineage of ancestors, spirits or guides, who offer wisdom and guidance in the spiritual journey.
3. **Heterodox Memory**: The ability to access memories and experiences of the ancestral lineage, breaking the conventional boundaries of time and space.
4. **Esoteric Practices**: Hidden, symbolic, or mysterious spiritual practices that lead towards self-mastery and transformative realization of higher truths.
5. **Praxis-By-Union**: Practical application of spiritual teachings through direct union with ancestral wisdom, ensuring an experiential and transformative assimilation of knowledge.
6. **Soteriological Potential**: The hidden capacity for salvation or spiritual deliverance within an individual.
7. **Evanescent Path of Mastery**: An ephemeral and elusive path towards spiritual mastery that remains ever-adapting to the adept's growth and development.

Now, let's delve into the steps an adept can take to attain Heterodox Memory and manifest the Evanescent Path of Mastery through the Ancestral Retinue and Praxis-By-Union.
**Step 1**: Establishing an Intimate Connection with the Ancestral Retinue
An adept must first cultivate a strong, intimate connection with their Ancestral Retinue. This can be achieved through various practices such as meditation, ancestor veneration, offerings, invocation of ancestral spirits, and dream work. The goal is to establish a bond of trust and communication with ancestral guides, enabling their wisdom, knowledge, and guidance to become accessible in daily life.
**Step 2**: Integrating Heterodox Memory
Once the connection with the Ancestral Retinue is established, the adept must work towards accessing and integrating Heterodox Memory. This may involve deep meditation, shamanic journeying, or other altered states of consciousness that facilitate access to the ancestral realm. By accessing the memories and experiences of their lineage, the adept gains insight, understanding, and wisdom, transcending the limitations of their own individual experience.
**Step 3**: Transforming Esoteric Practices into Praxis-By-Union
With the heterodox memories now accessible, the adept can begin to merge their practices with the direct wisdom and experience of the Ancestral Retinue. This Praxis-By-Union creates a unique and powerful synthesis of present knowledge and ancient understanding, giving rise to a highly personalized and transformative spiritual practice that transcends historical and cultural boundaries.
**Step 4**: Unveiling Hidden Soteriological Potential
As the adept's spiritual practice evolves through Praxis-By-Union, their hidden soteriological potential can begin to emerge. This may manifest as an increasing ability to tap into spiritual gifts, psychic abilities, or deeper levels of self-mastery. The adept will find joy, liberation, and spiritual empowerment by embracing the latent power within themselves.
**Step 5**: Manifesting the Evanescent Path of Mastery
Finally, as Praxis-By-Union continues to deepen and evolve, the adept's path will become ever more evanescent and elusive, reflecting their ongoing spiritual development. The Evanescent Path of Mastery indicates the adept fully embracing their own unique spiritual journey, in union with their Ancestral Retinue, ever adapting to the changing landscape of spiritual insight and growth.

In conclusion, an adept can attain Heterodox Memory by establishing an intimate connection with their Ancestral Retinue, and in doing so, transform their esoteric practices into a system of Praxis-By-Union. As a result, they can unveil the hidden soteriological potential within themselves and manifest the Evanescent Path of Mastery. This journey requires dedication, discipline, and an ongoing deepening of one's connection to ancestral wisdom but leads to profound spiritual growth and transformation.
