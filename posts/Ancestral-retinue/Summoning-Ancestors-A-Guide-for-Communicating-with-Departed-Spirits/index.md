excerpt: Design a comprehensive summoning ceremony to call forth a revered ancestor from the ancient lineage of the Ancestral Retinue. The ritual must involve the precise arrangement of sacred relics, the preparation of an ancestral blood offering, and the recitation of an invocation in the forgotten language of the Retinue. Include step-by-step instructions, detailing the chronological order of events, materials required, and necessary precautions taken to prevent any disturbances or unwelcome spirits during the process. Additionally, describe the expected outcome, including the form in which the ancestral spirit may appear and any special abilities or knowledge it may possess.
---**Step 0**: Preparations for the Summoning Ceremony
Before attempting the summoning, make sure to check the alignment of celestial bodies. The optimal time for summoning an ancestor lies within the full moon's night when the veil between worlds is at its thinnest.

Materials Required:

1. Ancestor's Talisman - an artifact connected to the ancestral lineage, ideally belonging to the ancestor being summoned.
2. Seven sacred relics - items connected to the practices, beliefs, or elements that held significance in the Ancestral Retinue's culture.
3. Blessed salt - a handful of coarse salt mixed with water, blessed by a spiritual practitioner.
4. Chalice filled with the summoner's blood - an offering linking the summoner to the ancestor. Collect no more than a few drops.
5. Incense, candles, and charcoal - for creating the appropriate atmosphere and purifying the area.
6. Sacred texts - manuscript, scroll, or stone tablet containing the invocation transcribed in the forgotten language of the Retinue.
**Step 1**: Purification of the Ritual Space
Thoroughly cleanse the ritual area, using incense and candles to purify its energy. Draw a circle upon the ground with blessed salt for protection, ensuring it is large enough to accommodate the sacred relics and participants.
**Step 2**: Arrangement of Sacred Relics
Position the seven sacred relics around the circle's perimeter in alignment with their corresponding elements. These relics shall serve as spiritual beacons, guiding the ancestral spirit toward the summoner.
**Step 3**: Preparation of the Ancestral Talisman
Place the Ancestor's Talisman in the circle's center. This personal artifact will be the vessel through which the ancestor manifests its presence.
**Step 4**: Recitation of the Invocation
Hold the sacred text containing the invocation, and proceed to recite the ancient language of the Retinue. Be prepared for an intense connection to the netherworld as the ancient words summon the ancestor's spirit.
**Step 5**: Ancestral Blood Offering
Once the invocation is complete, offer the chalice filled with the summoner's blood, signifying unity between the living descendant and the ancestral spirit.
**Step 6**: The Ancestor's Arrival
If the ritual has been performed correctly, the ancestor shall arrive within the circle. The ancestral spirit may take a variety of forms, from a tangible body to a transparent apparition. However, its appearance should remain recognizable and evoke a sense of familiarity.
**Step 7**: Dialogue and Knowledge Exchange
Engage with the ancestral spirit, absorbing any wisdom or guidance bestowed upon you. These departed beings possess unique knowledge spanning generations, offering profound insights into the past, present, and future.
**Step 8**: Conclusion and Gratitude
Once the conversation has reached its natural conclusion, express gratitude for the ancestor's assistance and, if necessary, ask the spirit to return to the afterlife. Extinguish the candles and incense, and carefully dismantle the salt circle, ensuring no remnants remain.

Take heed; summoning revered ancestors is not a task to be undertaken lightly. Although the Ancestral Retinue frowns upon excessive interference, treating the spirits with respect, and following these steps meticulously shall ensure safe and effective communication with the otherworld.
