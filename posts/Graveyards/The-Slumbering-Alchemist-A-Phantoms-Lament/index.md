Beneath this stone lies dormant, one possessed,
A master of the art, whom darkness kissed,
In days of yore, when shadows thrived and blessed,
Victorian whispers from the cryptic mist.

Transmute the tears of earth and sky he sought,
His heart consumed to grasp the opus grand,
The potions brewed, yearned secrets dearly bought,
For mastery, the elements at hand.

And yet forebode, the veil 'twixt worlds shall thin,
As sun declines and spectral moon doth rise,
His phantom form, in earth no longer pinned,
Reclaims the night and haunts a seeker's cries.

Alchemist, asleep, yet not for long,
In whispered breaths, this grave sings his song.
