- The incorporation of Yoruba Orishas and their attributes

In the context of African Cult practices and their relationship with Santa Muerte, the primary influence of African spirituality within the syncretic worship of Santa Muerte is the incorporation of Yoruba Orishas and their attributes.

Explanation:

The African Cult practices have a strong connection to African traditional religion, particularly the Yoruba religion. In this religion, the Orishas are the spiritual beings who serve as intermediaries between humans and the supreme being, Olodumare. The Yoruba religion and its Orishas have had a significant impact on the syncretic worship of Santa Muerte.

The Yoruba religion's influence on Santa Muerte is evident in the blending of Orishas' attributes, symbols, and characteristics into the worship of Santa Muerte. This syncretism occurs due to the shared belief in the supernatural and the existence of powerful deities or spiritual beings that can aid followers in navigating life's challenges.

For instance, Santa Muerte's association with protection, love, and healing reflects the qualities of some Yoruba Orishas such as Oshun (love and fertility), Obatala (peace and justice), and Eshu (communication between the human and spiritual realms). Many followers of Santa Muerte have also incorporated traditional Yoruba offerings, prayers, and ceremonies into their practices.

Additionally, the concept of Santa Muerte being a "patron saint" of marginalized or oppressed communities can be linked back to the Yoruba religious belief in specific Orishas' ability to protect and aid those in need, especially during times of hardship or transition.

In summary, the primary influence of African spirituality within the syncretic worship of Santa Muerte is most accurately described as the incorporation of Yoruba Orishas and their attributes. This connection reflects the strong bond between African Cult practices and the worship of Santa Muerte, as well as the larger historical connections between African spirituality and the syncretic religious traditions that have emerged in the Americas.
