Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot create visual images. However, I will describe the process of creating the sigil and provide a chant that reflects the shared energies between the African Cult and Santa Muerte.

To craft a powerful and intricate sigil, begin by selecting the most appropriate Adinkra symbols from the African Cult, such as:

1. **Gye Nyame**: Symbolizing the omnipotence and supremacy of spiritual forces
2. **Sankofa**: Representing the importance of learning from the past and moving towards a better future
3. **Akoma**: An emblem of patience, endurance, and unity

Next, identify key elements associated with Santa Muerte, such as:

1. **The scythe**: As a tool for reaping and harvesting, it represents cutting ties with the past and making way for new beginnings
2. **A balance scale**: Denoting fairness, equilibrium, and justice
3. **An hourglass**: Symbolizing the passage of time and the inevitability of mortality

Now, carefully weave together the Adinkra symbols and Santa Muerte imagery to form a harmonious design. For instance, you can combine the Gye Nyame symbol with the scythe to represent the spiritual supremacy that guides life transitions and transformations. Likewise, integrate the Sankofa symbol with the balance scale to symbolize the wisdom derived from the past to create a just and equitable future. Lastly, combine Akoma with the hourglass, representing the unity and patience that transcend the limitations of time.

Once the sigil design is complete, complement its power with invocations or chants. **Here's an example of a chant that embodies the shared energies of the African Cult and Santa Muerte**:

"O, Gye Nyame, celestial force, we heed your call
As the scythe shapes life, we embrace your sovereignty
Sankofa advises us to reclaim our past, illuminating our path
With scales of justice balanced, wisdom and fairness entwined
Akoma, our hearts endure, bound by unity and fortitude
The sands of time fall like whispers in the hourglass
In life and death, Santa Muerte, we honor your omnipresence
Together, we seek compassion, mysteries unraveled in your embrace"

Repeat this chant when invoking the energies of the sigil. By following these steps and guidelines, your sigil will embody the core principles of both spiritual practices and serve as a potent representation of their shared power and mystique.
