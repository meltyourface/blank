To respond to this knowledge challenge, it is important to first understand the key concepts involved, which include syncretism, African traditional religions, and the Santa Muerte cult. In the following response, we will delve into the predominant thematic interconnections, myths, and symbolism that exemplify the shared spiritual and magico-religious practices and beliefs of these traditions. We will then specifically focus on the significance of death, duality, and ancestral veneration in these belief systems.

Syncretism refers to the combination of different, often seemingly contradictory, religious or philosophical belief systems to create a new system. In the case of African traditional religions and the Santa Muerte cult, syncretism plays an integral part in shaping the shared spiritual and magico-religious practices and beliefs.

African traditional religions encompass a diverse range of beliefs and spiritual practices native to the various communities in Africa. They often center around animism, ancestor veneration, and the belief in a supreme being or beings. These religions typically maintain a strong connection to the natural world and the elements, revering gods and spirits associated with them.

The Santa Muerte cult, often mistakenly perceived as an offshoot of Mexican Catholicism, is a religious movement centered around the veneration of a female folk saint known as Santa Muerte or "Holy Death." While it originates from Mexico, the Santa Muerte cult incorporates Pre-Columbian beliefs and is, in fact, an amalgamation of indigenous, European, and African spiritual practices. Santa Muerte is often depicted as a skeletal figure holding a scythe and a globe, symbolizing her dominion over life and death.

In exploring the syncretism between African traditional religions and the Santa Muerte cult, the following thematic interconnections, myths, and symbolism have been found to exemplify their shared spiritual and magico-religious practices and beliefs:

1. **The significance of Death**: Both African traditional religions and the Santa Muerte cult place a heavy emphasis on the concept of death. In African traditional religions, the concept of death is often viewed as a transition to the spiritual realm, rather than an absolute end. Ancestors that pass on are seen as spiritual intermediaries between the living and the divine. Similarly, in the Santa Muerte cult, death is seen as part of the natural cycle of life, and the spiritual forces represented by Santa Muerte herself can act as a guide or an intermediary.

2. **Duality**: Duality is a major theme in both African traditional religions and the Santa Muerte cult. African traditional religions often involve the belief in a duality of forces - the supreme being, and myriad lesser gods, spirits, and ancestors who intervene in the matters of the earthly realm. Likewise, the Santa Muerte cult also encompasses a profound sense of duality. Santa Muerte exists in a dual nature, representing both life and death, and is often depicted in different color representations that reflect distinctive aspects of her reach - the white symbolizing purity and spiritual guidance, the red representing love and passion, and the black associated with protection, justice, and defense against negative energies.

3. **Ancestral Veneration**: In both African traditional religions and the Santa Muerte cult, ancestor veneration is essential to their spiritual practices, with each system acknowledging the importance of connecting with those who have passed as an integral part of communal identity. African traditional religions elevate ancestors to the level of demi-gods, who can influence and aid the living. Likewise, in the Santa Muerte cult, the dead are frequently invoked in rituals and prayer to seek guidance and protection.

In conclusion, the syncretism between African traditional religions and the Santa Muerte cult arises from their shared thematic interconnections, myths, and symbolism, particularly in the areas of death, duality, and ancestral veneration. These powerful themes provide a foundation for the spiritual and magico-religious practices and beliefs of both traditions, guiding their adherents in engaging with the mysteries of life, death, and the connection to the world beyond.
