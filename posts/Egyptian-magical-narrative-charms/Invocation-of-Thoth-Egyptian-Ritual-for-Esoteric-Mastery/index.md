Let the sacred ink of wisdom flow upon the papyrus of my heart, and with my words, I invoke the divine guidance and blessings of Djehuti, aka Thoth, sacred Ibis of Heliopolis, Grand Scribe to creation, Keeper of the Book of Thoth, and Master of magic.

Hail, Thoth, thrice-great, one of many names, guardian of the Akashic mysteries! Lord of Truth, in whose form rises the moon which sails in silver splendor on such vast, dark waters.

I stand before you, O Thoth, as a humble servant seeking the pathway to the heart of knowledge. Sustain and illuminate my spirit's scope and the melody of my voice as I embark on this voyage of esoteric mastery.

Oh mighty Thoth, please grant your divine presence as I perform the ceremonial ritual upon this night. First, I shall create a sacred space adorned with the sacred ibis, a symbol representing your divine wisdom and protection. I shall place papyrus scrolls, representing the sacred texts that hold the essence of your mastery.

Guardian of the Words of Power, I offer onto thee, sweet frankincense; a symbol of our everlasting bond. As the transcendental smoke binds our intentions, unite me into the cosmic heart of your silver moonlight.

By the wisdom of the ancient Egyptians, I shall light the flame of a three-fold candle, symbolizing the imperishable balance of harmony, wisdom, and understanding.

As above, so below; wherein the divine protection of the Ouroboros, the eternal dragon, doth weave it's form. Within this divine circle, I enshrine my intention to walk the path of mastery within the Egyptian magical narrative charms.

I humbly seek your guidance to fathom the depths of wisdom, particularly the sacred art of invoking the Egyptian deities, symbols, and rituals into an alluring narrative charm. As I recite these mystical texts, may the divine essence of Ma'at guide my intentions with truth, justice, and balance.

Oh, Great Lord of the Cosmos, I stand before thee, unworthy of such gifts divine. Yet in return for your favor, I pledge an oath to share your sacred teachings and wisdom with those who seek the light of knowledge. As your emissary, I shall dutifully honor and protect the traditions of your divine mysteries.

So, I ask you, Djehuti, Thoth of many names, to fulfill my request as I walk the path of magic. May our bond strengthen through each invocation and may the very breath of our alliance sanctify my journey through the realm of Egyptian magical narrative charms.

In your name of Thoth, the three times great Lord, may these words be a silver strand that binds our destinies, now and forevermore. Ankh, Udja, Seneb. So let it be.
