To perform this complex remote exorcism ritual, I will first gather the necessary forbidden tomes, sigils, and ritual components that will increase the potency and effectiveness of the rite. **Among these are**:

1. **The accursed tome "Ninth Circle of Perdition**: Revelations of Banishment."
2. Hellfire-painted wooden stave to focus the infernal energies.
3. Sigils of binding and banishment, inscribed in the blood of a repentant sinner.
4. Sulfurous incense from the trenches of the Ninth Circle.

With these tools, I will proceed through the following steps to successfully banish the malevolent demon and protect the host:

Step 1: Enact Protective Measures
Surround the host's dwelling with a circle of salt, effectively containing the demon within. Place talismans of protection upon the host's family and friends to shield them from any potential harm during the ritual.

Step 2: Commence the Ritual
Light the sulfurous incense, and perform a deep and reverberating chant derived from the tome "Ninth Circle of Perdition: Revelations of Banishment." This chant will create a spiritual connection with the host and notify the demon of their impending banishment.

Step 3: Weaken the Demon
Brandish the hellfire-painted stave and recite the specific invocation from the forbidden tome in which to render the demon weak and vulnerable to banishment.

Step 4: Channel the Abyssal Energies
Summon the raw, abyssal energies of Hell and channel them through the stave, directing them towards the possessed host. These energies will serve to dislodge the demon from its hold on the host, while ensuring not to inflict harm on them.

Step 5: Employ the Sigils
Inscribe the sigils of binding and banishment upon the air while mentally picturing the demon. These sigils will prevent any escape attempts and ensure that the demon's return to the nether realms is inescapable.

Step 6: Perform the Banishment
With the demon weakened and bound, perform the climactic and forceful demand for the entity to return to the Ninth Circle of Perdition. This banishment command, recited in a powerful and authoritative voice, will sever the connection between the demon and host and force the demon back into the infernal depths of Hell.

Step 7: Heal and Protect the Host
To close the ritual, perform a purifying and restorative rite upon the host, using the tome's passages explicitly written for this purpose. This will heal any physical, mental, and spiritual damage sustained and prevent the demon from reclaiming them as a host in the future.

Upon completion of these steps, the possessed individual will be freed from the demon's hold and their lives can return to normal. The demon will have been banished back to the Ninth Circle of Perdition, ensuring no further harm comes to those involved in the exorcism.
