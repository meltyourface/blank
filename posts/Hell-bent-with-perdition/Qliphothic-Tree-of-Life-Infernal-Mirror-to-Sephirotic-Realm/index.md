In the realm of infernal mysticism, the Qliphothic Tree of Life stands as a dark mirror to the Sephirotic Tree of Life in the Kabbalah. This sinister structure consists of ten spheres, or Qliphoth, which are layered in intricate pathways, revealing secrets of the darker aspects of existence. **The following is a detailed account of the contents and connections of each sphere**:

1. **Thaumiel**: Known as the "Twin Gods" or "Dual Contending Forces," Thaumiel is directly opposed to Kether, the crown of the Sephirotic Tree. Ruled by the malevolent Satan and Moloch, Thaumiel represents an opposition to unity and divine will. Resident entities in Thaumiel are embodiments of rebellion, chaos and destruction, seeking to disrupt the order of the mortal world.

2. **Ghagiel**: Correlating to Chokhmah, this sphere is ruled by the multi-headed dragon, Beelzebub, who is heavily associated with sins of pride and unchecked intellect. Inside Ghagiel, sinister entities manifest as twisted scholars and arrogant sorcerers, eager to undermine the wisdom shared in their Sephirotic counterpart.

3. **Sathariel**: The "Concealment of God" is governed by Lucifuge Rofocale, the demon of night and darkness. This sphere is linked to Binah, the realm of understanding. Sathariel seethes with hidden curses and lying spirits, which obscure truth and obstruct the comprehension of divine knowledge.

4. **Gamchicoth**: Spanning the vast expanse of Chesed, the opposite sphere of Gamchicoth, or "the Disputer," is ruled by Astaroth, a demon embodying envy, sedition and malevolence. Within Gamchicoth, one confronts malicious angels and ravenous spirits, all seeking to undermine divine mercy and agonize the mortal world.

5. **Golachab**: Asmodai, a demon of lust, manipulation and debauchery, controls this sphere directly opposite of Geburah. Golachab, or "Burning Bodies," is a realm of fiery torment and indiscriminate wrath. Entities from this sphere revel in bloodshed, violence, and terror, seeking to incite chaos amongst humanity.

6. **Thagirion**: Residing in the sinister shade of Tiferet, Thagirion is governed by Belphegor, the demon of sloth, vanity, and deception. Known as the "Disputer," Thagirion's inhabitants masquerade as false lights, corrupting mortal virtues and beauty, and leading the unwary into spiritual ruin.

7. **A'arab Zaraq**: Opposing Netzach, the sphere of A'arab Zaraq is governed by Baal and Lilith, who represent lewd indulgence and manipulation. The "Ravens of Dispersion" populate this realm, reveling in temptation, perversion, and the corrosion of human desire.

8. **Samael**: The Qliphoth of Hod embodies poison and death, governed by Adramelech, the bringer of pestilence and ruination. Samael, or "the Desolation of God," hosts entities that pervert logic and reason, injecting chaos and imbalance into mortal thought.

9. **Gamaliel**: As the dark reflection of Yesod, Gamaliel is governed by the demonic Lilith, the seductive night hag and corrupter of dreams. Inhabitants of this sphere are known as "the Obscene Ones," spreading impurity, defilement, and debasement of everything pure.

10. **Lilith**: Positioned against Malkuth, this final sphere bears the same name as its ruler, Queen Lilith herself. The infernal realm is teeming with her legions of succubi and incubi, seeking to make the mortal world submit to their lascivious whims and corruption.

These devastatingly adverse connections between the Sephiroth and their Qliphothic counterparts exhibit a disquieting balance between creation and destruction. The malevolent powers within the Qliphoth, if left unchecked, could unleash chaos, suffering, and spiritual ruin upon the mortal planes. The true significance of these sinister inhabitants lies in their ability to corrupt and manipulate humanity, serving as constant reminders of the darker aspects that lurk within the shadows of divine creation.
