To deconstruct the interdependent relationships among the Lords of the Elemental Planes, we first need to introduce these supernatural beings and their respective domains. The Lords of the Elemental Planes are traditionally associated with the four classical elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. These elements each have a ruling Lord - the Lord of the Earth, the Lord of the Air, the Lord of Fire, and the Lord of Water â€“ who are responsible for overseeing the regulation and balance of their respective domains. 

The interdependency of these Lords lies in their shared function to maintain the equilibrium of the natural world and elements. As Earth, Air, Fire, and Water are interconnected and support one another in various capacities, the Lords of these elements need to collaborate to ensure harmony. For instance, Earth requires water for agriculture to sustain life; air relies on fire to maintain warmth; fire needs air to survive and propagate; water is crucial for regulating the planet's temperature, and fire plays a role in shaping the earth's crust through volcanic activities, among other examples.

Individual dominions of the Lords of the Elemental Planes are as follows:

1. **Lord of the Earth**: maintains the stability and fertility of the earth, ensuring crop growth and tectonic plate balance. The Earth Lord also plays a significant role in determining the state of material wealth and prosperity. 

2. **Lord of the Air**: governs the wind, climate, and atmosphere. The Air Lord is crucial in maintaining air circulation, weather patterns, and the balance of gases that support human life and the ecosystem.

3. **Lord of Fire**: oversees the power and transformative nature of fire: volcanoes, combustion, and warmth. The Fire Lord is responsible for the regulation of heat, ignition of life-giving energy, and destruction to pave way for renewal.

4. **Lord of Water**: presides over the water systems on the planet, such as oceans, rivers, lakes, and rainfall. The Water Lord maintains water cycles, sustains aquatic life, and purifies the freshwater necessary for Earth's inhabitants.

The rise and fall of elemental balance are directly correlated with the actions and reactions of these Lords. For instance, if the Lord of Water fails to restrain excessive precipitation, it will lead to flooding, causing havoc to the ecosystem, while disruption in the Lord of Fire's domain might result in uncontrolled wildfires or eruptions. Naturally, such imbalances have a domino effect on the other elements and their domains as they seek to reestablish equilibrium.

From a historical standpoint, the Lords of the Elemental Planes have significantly influenced the occult and esoteric realms. Many cultures and religious traditions have attributed elemental deities to these Lords and sought to understand their interactions to gain insights into the mysteries of the natural world. Some examples are the Greek Titans and their control over various elements, or the Hindu god Shiva, who displays both destructive and constructive qualities similar to the roles of the Fire and Earth Lords.

Within esotericism and occultism, the Lords of the Elemental Planes have often been regarded as powerful spiritual entities or archetypal forces to be employed in magical practices. Various ritualistic invocations, sigils, and talismans have been designed to harness the energies of these Lords in different magical workings, such as elemental quarter calls, or even invoked during the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, a popular ceremonial ritual.

In conclusion, the Lords of the Elemental Planes play an essential role in maintaining the elemental balance of the Earth. The interdependence between these Lords and their respective elements reveals their crucial task in upholding harmony in the natural world. Moreover, the historical impact of these beings extends into occultism and esotericism, informing various cultural and spiritual practices. Recognizing the interconnectedness of the Lords of the Elemental Planes and their significance in both the material realm and the world of the esoteric aids in understanding the complexities of our world.
