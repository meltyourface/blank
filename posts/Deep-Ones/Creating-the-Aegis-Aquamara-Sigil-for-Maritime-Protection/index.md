Sigil Design:

The sigil, called "Aegis Aquamara," will be a meticulously crafted arcane emblem that combines ancient mystical symbols for protection and repulsion, as well as elements that embody the essence of the sea and the resilience of its explorers.

1. Begin with the outermost shape: a circle, representing the cycle of life and the continuity of the ocean.
2. Within the circle, inscribe a crescent moon with horns pointing upward, symbolizing the influence of lunar cycles and tides on the watery depths.
3. Then, create three overlapping equilateral triangles forming a hexagram. This represents the balance of elements (water, earth, air, fire) and the dual nature of maritime (surface and deep).
4. Inside the hexagram, inscribe a downward-pointing pentagram, denoting a shield against detrimental influences and malicious intent.
5. At the center of these shapes, place the Eye of Horus, an ancient symbol of protection, healing, and rejuvenation.
6. Add Sigil of Sèrìménàn, four interwoven S shapes in a circle, representing the unity of all forces involved in the protection against Deep Ones.
7. For added protection, encircle the entire design with powerful runic phrases from ancient maritime traditions.

Ritual for Consecrating "Aegis Aquamara":

This intricate ritual serves to imbue the sigil with immense mystical potency and attune the emblem to the specific intention of safeguarding the wearer from the supernatural influence of the Deep Ones.

1. Commence the ritual by preparing a sacred space inside an octagonal chamber representing the eight cardinal directions, surrounded by symbols of maritime and protective forces.
2. Cleanse and purify the area with sea salt and sacred water, sprinkling it counterclockwise while chanting a prayer for protection.
3. Place four sacred stones (aquamarine, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and black obsidian) at the chamber's corners to attune the energy of the sea.
4. Begin the consecration by drawing the "Aegis Aquamara" sigil on a silver disc submerged in seawater gathered from the darkest depths of the ocean during a full moon.
5. Illuminate the ritual area using six candles embedded in protective metal shells, surrounding the silver sigil.
6. Empower the sigil by invoking the great deities and guardian spirits of the ocean, like Poseidon, Sedna, and Varuna, through a litany of invocations and praises.
7. Proclaim the sigil's divine purpose by repeating the following incantation: "By the power of sacred seas and ancient knowledge hidden deep, protect those who venture below from the ones who will not sleep. Aegis Aquamara, thy shield I now enthrone, deliver strength and safeguard for waters yet unknown."
8. Charge the sigil with intention by placing both hands upon it, visualizing a vortex of protective energy drawn from the ocean and channeled through your fingertips into the symbol.
9. End the ritual by allowing the candles to burn down, symbolizing enduring illumination and barrier against darkness.
10. Meticulously carve the sigil into an amulet or talisman for each explorer and let it be worn around the neck or wrist, ensuring the consecrated sigil is in constant contact with their body.

By employing the "Aegis Aquamara" sigil and its consecration ritual, underwater explorers will be bestowed with an unwavering defense against the manipulative power of the enigmatic Deep Ones, guarding their minds and spirits during their odyssey into the blackest abyss.
