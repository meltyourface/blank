excerpt: > 
  Conduct a Viper's Veil energy purification and banishment ceremony with the intent to eradicate lingering negative energies, focusing on the incorporation of viper-inspired symbolism, the utilization of specific ritualistic elements such as consecrated snake talismans, and the recitation of an original, powerful incantation to summon the serpentine essence for a complete energy clearing and protection.

To begin the Viper's Veil energy purification and banishment ceremony, carefully prepare your sacred space. Ensure that all the necessary ritual elements are present, including consecrated snake talismans, candles in colors representing the viper, like deep greens and blacks, an offering of fragrant herbs or resins such as frankincense, myrrh or sandalwood, and a ceremonial dagger or athame.
**Step 1**: Purification of self and space
Begin by performing a ritualistic purification of your own energy and the surrounding space. Light the candles, and envision in your mind the energy of the viper, coiled and waiting like a powerful guardian. Visualize this energy pulsating within yourself and expanding outward, consuming negativity. As you do this, smudge the area with the fragrant herbs or resins, ensuring every corner is filled with purifying smoke.
**Step 2**: Invoke the Viper's Veil
Hold the consecrated snake talisman in your hand, and recite the following incantation with conviction and power:

"Hiss and slither, serpentine wonder,
Awaken the force, thy Viper's thunder!
From this veil I summon thee,
Protect this space, set it free.

Viper's Veil guards me now,
Banishes darkness, makes it bow.
As above, so below,
From the serpent's fangs, let protection flow!"
**Step 3**: Drawing the Viper's Sigil
Using the ceremonial dagger or athame, draw a sacred sigil in the air, symbolizing the culmination of the Viper's power. The sigil should be shaped like an 'S' (for the serpent's body) with an open-ended triangle (representing the viper's fangs) above it. As you make these movements, envision the energy of the viper swirling around the sigil, amplified and strengthened.
**Step 4**: Channeling serpentine energy
Focus on channeling the energy of the Viper through the talisman and your body. Envision the Viper snaking its way through the space, weaving an energetic veil that pushes away any lingering negative energy and banishing it from your presence.
**Step 5**: Sealing and completion
Once the energy has been channeled and the space purified, conclude the ceremony by saying:

"In the name of the sacred Viper, source of power and protection,
I seal this space from negativity, with the strength of the serpent's reflection.
From this moment forth, let purity reign,
And may this Viper's Veil never wane."

As you utter these words, visualize the shroud of the Viper's Veil settling in place, guarding against all future negative influences. Extinguish the candles, and respectfully dispose of the herb or resin offerings, as the ceremony is now complete.

Following these steps with intent and conviction will ensure that the energy in your space is purified and protected by the enigmatic power of the Viper's Veil.
