## Title: Viper's Coiled Path Divination

**Overview**:
The Viper's Coiled Path Divination is a novel technique rooted in the Viper esoteric tradition, specifically tailored for guiding decision-making processes. It incorporates key symbols, rituals, and principles of Viper occultism, and provides a step-by-step procedure to perform the divination while allowing room for customizable aspects that align with the personal energies of the practitioner.

**Key Symbols**: 
1. Viper - representing transformation, rebirth, and wisdom.
2. Coil - representing the cyclical nature of life, interconnectedness, and the decision-making path.
3. Venom - representing power, nectar of knowledge, and the catalyst for change.
4. Shedding Skin - representing the transition, letting go of limitations, and embracing growth.

Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Preparation**:
    a. Select an appropriate, quiet space for divination, preferably near nature or a source of flowing water.
    b. Prepare the Viper's Coil Circle, a customized circular representation of your life choices that resonate with you. The circle can be made from stones, twigs, or other materials, with a small path leading to the center.
    c. Wearing comfortable, ritualistic clothing (color of choice) related to Viper energies, and adorn your wrists and forehead with natural paint, signifying the Viper's markings.
    d. Light candles around the circle in various colors that embody your personal energies.

2. **Invocation**:
    a. Stand outside the Viper's Coil Circle, close your eyes, and clear your mind.
    b. Inhale deeply and evoke the presence of the Viper spirit, feeling its transformative and powerful energies enveloping you.
    c. Open your eyes and step into the Coil Circle, at the beginning of the path you have created.

3. **Tailored Divination Decision**:
    a. Mentally state your decision-making query.
    b. Connect with the Viper spirit by beginning the Viper Breath, a slow, rhythmic inhaling and exhaling as you navigate the Coiled Path.
    c. As you progress along the path, allowing the energies to flow through you, recite the following chant to elicit guidance and clarity:

        "Oh, Viper, guide my stride,
         As I walk this coiled tide.
         With venom and rebirth, unveil,
         The wisdom of my chosen trail."

4. **Symbols and Their Meanings**:
    a. Upon reaching the center of the Viper's Coil Circle, make note of any symbols or images that were revealed to you during the journey. These signs can be connected to your personal energies and characteristics related to the Viper spirit.
    b. Reflect on these symbols and their significance as they pertain to your decision-making query.

5. **Decision and Conclusion**:
    a. Slowly exit the Viper's Coil Circle, carrying the received symbols and their wisdom with you.
    b. Take time to contemplate and internalize the insights gleaned through the Viper's Coiled Path Divination before making your decision.
    c. Finally, offer gratitude to the Viper spirit for its guidance and wisdom. Extinguish the candles and disassemble the Viper's Coil Circle.

Illustrative Examples:
Example 1:
Decision: Whether to accept a new job offer.
Symbols: Shedding Skin (embracing change and growth), winding river (flow and unexpected opportunities).
Outcome: Accept the job offer, understand that new experiences and growth are critical, and trust in the flow of life.

Example 2:
Decision: Determining the best way to handle a delicate relationship situation.
Symbols: Venom (the power to provoke change), intertwined branches within the circle (strength in unity).
Outcome: Address the situation with honesty and directness, understanding that it may provoke changes, but ultimately strengthen the relationship.
