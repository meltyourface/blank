## Title: Sir Francis Drake's Voyages and the Politics of the Elizabethan Era

Introduction

The Elizabethan era, spanning from 1558 to 1603, marked an important period in English history. It was a time of heightened political intrigue, religious conflicts, and ambitious explorations led by the likes of Sir Francis Drake. Through careful analysis of primary sources, particularly the accounts by Drake himself and the political correspondence of prominent figures such as the Earl of Essex, we can better understand the underlying political motivations that drove their actions. In this essay, we will delve into the historical context and key expressions in these primary sources that signify deeper agendas, loyalty or opposition to Queen Elizabeth I, as well as their stance on religious and international issues of that time. Additionally, we will explore the potential impact of these motivations on the historical events that transpired during the Elizabethan era.

Sir Francis Drake's Accounts of His Voyages: Evidence of Political Motivations

Sir Francis Drake, an English sea captain, slave trader, and privateer, is best known for his circumnavigation of the globe. He was a staunch supporter of Queen Elizabeth I and sought to please and protect her interests. In his accounts of his voyages, we can identify several key expressions and phrases that suggest certain political motivations:

1. **Loyalty to Queen Elizabeth I**: Drake's writings often emphasized his dedication to serving the Queen, indicating his loyalty to the monarch. For example, he described his voyages as "humble services performed for her Majesty's sake" (Drake, cited in Kelsey, 1988, p.152). This statement underscores his devotion to his sovereign as both a personal and professional duty.

2. **Defending Protestantism**: Drake was a committed Protestant and saw his explorations as an opportunity to combat the Catholic Spanish Empire. For instance, he allegedly claimed that his main objective was to "pluck the feathers from the overgrown and arrogant Spanish bird" (Drake, cited in Kelsey, 1988, p.63). This phrase suggests his intention to weaken Spain, which was a staunch Catholic nation and the primary rival of Protestant England.

3. **Expansion and Wealth**: Drake was driven by the pursuit of wealth and territorial expansion, as evidenced by his enthusiastic accounts of plundering Spanish ships and establishing colonies in the New World. For example, he wrote, "All the golden mines which are now found shall be as nothing, in comparison of the great riches and mighty strength that shall be" (Drake, cited in Kelsey, 1988, p.129). This statement highlights his ambition and desire for tangible rewards from his ventures.

The Earl of Essex's Political Correspondence: Uncovering Hidden Agendas and Loyalty

The Earl of Essex, Robert Devereux, was a close companion of Queen Elizabeth I and an influential political advisor. However, his loyalty and motivations were often questioned due to his involvement in various conflicts and intrigues. By scrutinizing his political correspondence, we can detect subtle indications of his allegiance, ambitions, and stances on crucial issues:

1. **Complexity of Loyalty**: In one of his letters, Essex wrote, "I owe her Majesty infinite thanks for the titles she has given me, but I need not be ambitious, having already above five hundred ways to nothing" (Essex, cited in Dunn, 2003, p.176). This statement reveals the complexity of Essex's loyalty to the Queen, implying that while he appreciated her recognition, he did not nurse any personal ambitions for power or notoriety.

2. Protestantism vs. **Catholicism**: Despite his ambiguous relationship with the Queen, Essex remained a staunch Protestant and opposed any accommodation with Catholicism. For instance, he wrote, "I have always held that the Papists (Catholics) are not our fellow subjects but always have been and ever will be preparers to the ruin of the State" (Essex, cited in Hammer, 1999, p.113). This quote underscores his suspicion of Catholics and their potential threat to England.

3. **Foreign Policy Stances**: Essex's letters often mentioned his support for aggressive action against Spain, expressing a belligerent stance on international policy. For example, he wrote, "The true means to consume the King of Spain is to assail him in his Indies" (Essex, cited in Hammer, 1999, p.98). This statement indicates his advocacy for offensive measures, specifically targeting Spain's colonies in the Americas to weaken their empire.

Impact of These Motivations on Historical Events

Encapsulating the sociopolitical context of the Elizabethan era, the motivations identified in Sir Francis Drake's accounts and the Earl of Essex's correspondence significantly impacted the historical events that unfolded during this period. Their loyalty to Queen Elizabeth I led to their unwavering support of her policies, thereby solidifying her reign and strengthening England's position as a global power. Their Protestant beliefs influenced their approach towards Catholic adversaries, resulting in tensions and conflicts with Spain, eventually culminating in the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585-1604. Moreover, their ambitions for wealth and territorial expansion drove England's explorations and settlements in the New World, laying the foundation for the British Empire.

Conclusion

In conclusion, by examining primary sources from the Elizabethan era, we are able to unravel the complex political motivations that guided influential figures such as Sir Francis Drake and the Earl of Essex. Through content analysis, we discern their loyalty or opposition to the monarch, their stances on religious and international issues, and the resulting repercussions in the historical events that transpired. This meticulous inquiry enables us to better understand and appreciate the sociopolitical intricacies of the Elizabethan era and the motivations that propelled their actions.
