In order to explore the various layers of symbolism in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, we shall delve into the myth, trace the journey according to Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey framework, discuss the psychological implications pointed out by Carl Jung, and integrate the Tarot archetypes for a well-rounded understanding. Finally, we shall unveil the hidden wisdom that may emerge from the hero's quest. 

The tale of Orpheus and Eurydice is a Greek myth about the power of love and art. Orpheus, a talented musician and a poet, falls in love and marries Eurydice. Soon after their wedding, Eurydice is bitten by a snake and dies. Grief-stricken, Orpheus descends into the underworld to retrieve his beloved. Through the power of his music, he charms Hades and Persephone, convincing them to allow Eurydice to return to the world of the living. The only condition is that Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice until they reach the surface. Tragically, he falters just moments before succeeding and loses Eurydice forever.

Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey framework consists of three main stages: Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages, he identifies key events and challenges that the hero must face. In the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, we can trace these steps as follows:

1. **Departure**: Orpheus suffers the great loss of his wife, which motivates him to embark on the journey into the underworld.
2. **Initiation**: The descent into the underworld embodies the challenges Orpheus faces, including overcoming obstacles and confronting his fears. His innate gift of music helps him gain favor with Hades and Persephone.
3. **Return**: Orpheus and Eurydice attempt to return to the world of the living, but Orpheus' inability to follow the instructions leads to the tragic permanent loss of his wife, thus completing the cycle of transformation.

Carl Jung's theories on archetypes and the collective unconscious can be applied to understand the psychological significance of this myth. It is possible to see Orpheus as representing the Ego, striving to maintain control and integrity in the face of uncertainty and loss. Eurydice could symbolize the Anima, the feminine aspect of the masculine psyche, representing love and vulnerability. The underworld journey may represent the descent into the unconscious, with the hope of confronting and integrating aspects of the psyche that have been repressed.

Tarot archetypes are symbolic representations of various stages and aspects of human experience. In the context of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, the following cards could be associated with key events and themes:
1. **The Lovers**: Orpheus and Eurydice's union, representing love, commitment, and harmony.
2. **Death**: Eurydice's demise, signifying change, transformation, and the cycle of life.
3. **The Devil**: Hades, embodying temptation, bondage, and the conditions set by the underworld rulers.
4. **The Fool**: Orpheus' failed attempt to bring Eurydice back, representing a lesson of trust and the consequences of inaction. 

In conclusion, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice is a narrative rich in symbolism that speaks to the human experience of love, loss, and transformation. Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey allows us to map out the stages and challenges of the myth, while Carl Jung's psychological theories provide insight into the inner workings of the characters. Lastly, the Tarot archetypes offer a further layer of symbolic understanding of key events and themes. Through this exploration, we can discern the hidden wisdom revealed by Orpheus' quest: the importance of trusting ourselves and our inner guidance, the inevitability of change, and the potential within us for growth and transformation, even in the face of great loss.
