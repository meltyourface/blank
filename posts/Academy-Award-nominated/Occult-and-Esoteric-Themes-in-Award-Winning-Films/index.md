In analyzing the influence of occultism and esotericism within Academy Award-nominated films, it is important to first understand the concepts of occultism and esotericism themselves. Occultism refers to the study of hidden or secret knowledge, often dealing with supernatural or magical forces. Esotericism, on the other hand, refers to teachings or practices that are intended for a select group of individuals and are not meant for the general public's understanding. Both concepts often have a strong influence on the themes of knowledge, power, and transformation.

Within the realm of film, occultism and esotericism have frequently been used to explore deeper insights into the human condition and challenge conventional beliefs about reality. This analysis will delve into how these two concepts have shaped the narratives of Academy Award-nominated films, affected the journeys of the protagonists, and intertwined with the audience's perception of reality and social commentary.

One prominent example of this influence can be found in the film "The Sixth Sense" by M. Night Shyamalan, which was nominated for six Academy Awards in 1999. The esoteric elements of the story lie in the protagonist's ability to see and communicate with ghosts. This hidden knowledge transforms protagonist Cole's views on life and ultimately helps him come to terms with his personal fears and insecurities while also assisting others in their own emotional healing.

Moreover, the film's occult themes challenge the audience to reconsider their own perceptions of reality, making us question the nature of existence and our understanding of life after death. This resonates as a broader social commentary, encouraging society to further develop empathy and understanding towards one another. In essence, the film reveals the power that lies within the hidden aspects of existence by bringing them to light.

Another example would be the 2016 film "Doctor Strange," which was nominated for an Academy Award in Visual Effects. In this film, we see the protagonist, Stephen Strange, embark on a journey to heal himself physically and psychologically by delving into the world of esoteric knowledge. He becomes entangled with the teachings of mysticism, astral projection, and other forms of occultism, granting him extraordinary abilities and permitting him to manipulate reality.

As the audience watches Doctor Strange's character develop, they are invited to explore the concept of personal transformation and self-discovery. By demonstrating how the acquisition of esoteric knowledge has led the protagonist on an inner journey, the film addresses the importance of seeking truth beyond the realms of conventional understanding.

Furthermore, another Academy Award-nominated film to consider is "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006) by Guillermo del Toro, which was nominated for six Academy Awards and won three. This fantastical film features a young protagonist named Ofelia who encounters a hidden, magical world that coexists alongside the harsh reality of post-war Spain. The film employs elements of both esotericism and occultism, as Ofelia is guided through magical realms and encounters mysterious creatures.

The film's blending of the magical and the real world highlights the concept of duality, which is a fundamental theme of occultism, and celebrates the power of imagination in the face of adversity. As Ofelia's journey unfolds, her escapades into the realm of the unknown serves as a powerful metaphor for challenging societal norms and the oppressive forces at play in her reality.

In conclusion, the influence of occultism and esotericism in Academy Award-nominated films can be seen through thematic explorations of hidden knowledge, personal transformation, and challenging the conventional understanding of reality. These concepts significantly impact the protagonists' journeys, prompting self-discovery, overcoming adversity, and instigating change. In addition, the presence of these mystical elements in films serves to create powerful social commentary that encourages the audience to question their reality and engage in deeper philosophical discussions on the nature of existence.
