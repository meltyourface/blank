## Title: The Occult Themes in Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut"

Introduction

"Eyes Wide Shut," a 1999 Academy Award-nominated erotic psychological thriller directed by the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, may seem at first glance, like a mere exploration of the darker aspects of human desire and obsession. However, upon more astute observation, one can uncover a multitude of esoteric and occult influences that are woven intricately into the fabric of the narrative. In this analysis, I will delve into the significance of these themes and demonstrate how they interconnect with the principles and teachings of both Eastern and Western occult traditions.

1. The use of occult symbolism

The very centerpiece of "Eyes Wide Shut" is a mysterious, high-society ritualistic gathering, which the protagonist Dr. Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, infiltrates. This gathering features a masked ball with participants wearing Venetian-style masks, engaging in strange ritualistic acts, and partaking in sexual activities. This scene serves as a symbolic representation of hidden knowledge, secrecy, and the world of the occult. The masks and costumes suggest the idea of anonymity and concealment, which in Western occult traditions has been linked to the concept of hidden wisdom, particularly the teachings of secret societies such as the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

2. The unifying principles of Eastern and Western occultism

In both Eastern and Western occult practices, the concept of attaining self-knowledge, spiritual growth, and the ultimate realization of one's true nature (as either divine or demonic) are central themes. In "Eyes Wide Shut," the protagonist's journey can be seen as a representation of the "initiatory ordeal" – a key element in the process of becoming a spiritual adept in both Eastern and Western occult traditions. Dr. Harford undergoes a series of trials and tribulations, including being seduced by various women, witnessing an orgy, and confronting the powerful and mysterious figures who preside over the ritual. This series of tests can be seen as Dr. Harford's path towards understanding himself, both in terms of his own desires and as an individual in a world governed by secrecy and power.

3. The duality of human nature

"Eyes Wide Shut" explores the notion of the duality of human nature and the presence of both light and dark within the soul – a principle found in both Western and Eastern occultism. According to the Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism that is an essential part of Western occultism, the ultimate goal of human life is to reconcile and unify these opposing forces within oneself. For Dr. Harford, his journey leads him to confront his darker impulses and his struggle to understand and integrate them. In Eastern occultism, the concept of duality is also present, as seen in Taoism's representation of Yin and Yang as complementary, and ultimately, harmonious forces.

4. The search for truth

Finally, the most significant aspect of "Eyes Wide Shut" as it relates to the esoteric and occult teachings is the protagonist's search for truth. Dr. Harford's journey is a descent into a hidden world that he was previously unaware of, seeking answers to the mysteries that surround him. This idea of the search for truth, knowledge, and understanding through initiation and transformation is at the core of all occult practices, both in the Eastern and Western traditions. The film serves as an allegory depicting the path of the seeker, as Dr. Harford uncovers layers of esoteric wisdom and eventually finds a sense of clarity and resolution.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the significance of the esoteric and occult themes in "Eyes Wide Shut" lies in the exploration of the deep-rooted mysteries that surround the human experience, including matters of self-discovery, duality, and the search for truth. The film's symbolism and narrative reveal a profound interconnectedness with the principles and teachings of both Eastern and Western occult traditions. Through the journey of the protagonist, the film establishes itself as a compelling exploration of what it means to be human, delving into our darkest desires, our quest for knowledge, and our ever-present pursuit of self-understanding.
