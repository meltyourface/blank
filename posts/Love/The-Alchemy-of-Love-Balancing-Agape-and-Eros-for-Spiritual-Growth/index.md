To address this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the key concepts: Divine Union, the Lovers card in Tarot, the Red King and White Queen in alchemy, Agape and Eros love. Then, we will integrate these concepts into a multi-dimensional framework that highlights love's transcendent and transformative aspects in human relationships, spiritual growth, and self-discovery.

**Divine Union**: The Divine Union refers to a state or process of merging with the divine essence or oneness. It usually entails the union of opposites or polarities, representing the sacred and eternal balance between masculine and feminine energies.

**The Lovers card in Tarot**: The Lovers card is the sixth major arcana card in the Tarot deck. Traditionally, it represents relationships, unions, harmony, and choices. The card typically shows a man and a woman, with the angel Raphael presiding over them. More than just romantic love, the Lovers card symbolizes the balancing of opposites, making choices, and the integration of the conscious and subconscious mind.

**The Red King and White Queen in Alchemy**: In the realm of alchemy, the Red King (masculine aspect) and White Queen (feminine aspect) represent the union of opposites. This union results in the Philosopher's Stone, which can transform base metals into gold, signifying spiritual enlightenment and the union of the human and divine.

**Agape and Eros love**: Applied to love, Eros represents sensual, romantic, and passionate love, whereas Agape suggests unconditional, spiritual, and selfless love. Eros is the desire to merge with another person, while Agape is the embodiment of divine or universal love.

Now, let's create a multi-dimensional framework to understand love's transcendent and transformative aspects.

1. **Personal Relationships**: In the context of human relationships, the Lovers card, Red King, and White Queen symbolize the balance and integration of masculine and feminine energies. Embracing Eros enables individuals to explore connections, passion, and vulnerability, while Agape allows for selflessness and spiritual growth.

2. **Spiritual Growth**: The alchemical union of Red King and White Queen, along with the balance of Agape and Eros love, can inspire spiritual growth. This involves purifying one's intentions, staying true to personal values, increasing self-awareness, and striving for inner harmony. As individuals align with these energies, they embark on a journey towards self-discovery and spiritual enlightenment.

3. **Self-Discovery**: Tapping into both the Lovers card's dualities and the integration of Agape and Eros love, individuals begin to understand their true nature and potential. As a result, they are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the human experience, staying mindful of interconnectedness and interdependence.

Alternative answers explored:
It is essential to consider the transformative power inherent within love's complexities rather than focus solely on romantic aspects. This enables individuals to engage more authentically with the full range of emotions, truly transforming their relationships, personal growth, and self-awareness journey.

In conclusion, the multi-dimensional framework we proposed unveils the transcendent and transformative aspects of love by uniting the concepts of the Lovers card, the Red King and White Queen, and the balance between Agape and Eros love. It highlights the significance of these ideas for personal relationships, spiritual growth, and self-discovery. Through understanding these deeper connections, individuals may cultivate a richer experience of love that transcends the material plane and aligns with the Divine.
