  Answer:
  
  To fully respond to the knowledge challenge posed, let us first define and elaborate on the key concepts mentioned: the Amentan Gates, the Sephirot of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and crossing the Abyss. We will then explore their symbolic and transcendent relationships and draw parallels in their respective progressions to outline the path to achieving spiritual and esoteric unity with one's higher self.
  
  The Amentan Gates, derived from the practice of Amentan Magick, comprise a system of spiritual initiation and progression through twelve gates or stages. Each gate is associated with specific trials, rituals and teachings intended to develop one's spiritual and esoteric abilities and eventually lead to the initiation into Mastery. The progression through the gates represents the journey from mundane existence to spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine.
  
  The Sephirot, in the context of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, represent ten interconnected spheres of emanation, each embodying an aspect of God's creative force or energy. The Tree of Life itself is a central symbol in the Kabbalah, which is a Jewish mystical and esoteric tradition, tracing its origins to medieval times. The Tree of Life is a map of the universe and human consciousness, and the Sephirot are the points through which one's spiritual journey towards enlightenment and divine reunification is facilitated.
  
  Crossing the Abyss refers to a crucial juncture of mystical initiation, where one faces the ultimate challenge in surrendering one's ego and attachments to cross the symbolic abyss. This transcendent experience is associated with the esoteric motifs of death and rebirth and represents the final stage before achieving union with the divine.
  
  Upon analyzing these three concepts, we can observe the parallel between the Amentan Gates, the Sephirot, and crossing the Abyss in forming a symbolic framework for spiritual progression.
  
  The Amentan Gates bear resemblance to the Sephirot's structure and function of guiding the initiate through successive stages of spiritual growth. While the Amentan Gates consist of twelve stages, the Tree of Life features ten Sephirot, plus a hidden eleventh sphere called Da'at. This eleventh sphere is the one that initiates the crossing of the Abyss and is a symbolic node of passage towards the higher Sephirot, which represent divine wisdom and pure consciousness.
  
  Crossing the Abyss resonates with the trials and challenges faced when traversing the Amentan Gates or ascending the Tree of Life. As the initiate progresses through these trials, their spiritual growth mirrors the symbolic shedding of layers, akin to the dismantling of the ego, which is a prerequisite for crossing the Abyss. As the ego dissolves, it signifies a surrendering to the divine.
  
  An example of a metaphorical expression of these journeys can be found in the symbol of the Phoenix â€“ a mythical bird that periodically dies and is reborn from its own ashes. This motif captures the cycles of transformation, transcendence, and regeneration that initiates undergo while working through the Amentan Gates, traversing the Tree of Life, and eventually crossing the Abyss.
  
  In conclusion, the Amentan Gates, Sephirot of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and crossing the Abyss share several key themes and ideas that form a comprehensive, symbolic, and transcendent framework for spiritual progression. Among these themes are initiation, stages of spiritual growth, surrender of the ego, facing trials and challenges, and ultimately achieving unity with one's higher self through spiritual rebirth and enlightenment. These concepts serve to guide the seeker along a well-worn path towards self-discovery, spiritual metamorphosis, and divine reunification.
