## The Veil of Ishtar

**Location**: Ishtar Gate, Babylon

**Date and Time**: The ritual should be performed during the Waxing Gibbous Moon, on a Friday, at dusk.

**Participants**: A high priestess, two acolytes, and any devotees who wish to attend. The high priestess and acolytes must wear traditional Mesopotamian clothing and jewelry, signifying their roles and connection to the goddess Ishtar.

**Preparation**: Participants should purify themselves with a ritual bath, and dress in the traditional attire. They should also fast for 24 hours before the ritual. The ritual area should be cleansed and consecrated using cedar incense and sacred water from the Euphrates River, while reciting a cuneiform incantation for the purification of space.

**Altar**: An altar should be set up by the Ishtar Gate, adorned with symbols and artwork dedicated to Ishtar, including the eight-pointed star, the lion, and the dove. The altar must also have cuneiform inscriptions of praise and devotion to Ishtar.

**Offerings**: Blue irises, lapis lazuli, carnelian, and storax incense should be arranged on the altar as offerings to Ishtar.

1. Gathering

The participants, led by the high priestess and acolytes, will process to the Ishtar Gate while singing a sacred hymn dedicated to the goddess, accompanied by the playing of traditional Mesopotamian musical instruments, such as the lyre and tambourines.

2. Invocation

Upon reaching the altar, the high priestess will recite an incantation in the ancient Akkadian language, invoking Ishtar's presence and asking for her blessings. The acolytes will assist by holding the sacred symbols of Ishtar.

3. Offering and Supplication

The high priestess will present the offerings of blue irises, lapis lazuli, carnelian, and storax incense, on behalf of the participants. Then, she will recite a cuneiform prayer, expressing gratitude and requesting guidance from Ishtar.

4. Ceremonial Dance

All participants will take part in a ritual dance, a symbolic reenactment of Ishtar's descent into and return from the underworld. The dance will be accompanied by rhythmic drumming, symbolizing the beating heart of the goddess.

5. Blessings and Closing

The high priestess will bless the participants with sacred water from the Euphrates River, sprinkling it over them as a sign of Ishtar's protection and favor. Then, the ritual will close with a final hymn, sung by all participants, and an expression of gratitude to the goddess.

Afterward, the participants can share a communal meal, featuring traditional Mesopotamian foods, to ground themselves and strengthen the bonds of their spiritual community.
