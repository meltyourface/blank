### II. Intent and Purpose
When utilizing Saint Cyprian's magic, the purpose of every action must align with the pursuit of wisdom and spiritual growth. Magic must never be used for destructive, malicious purposes or to manipulate others unjustly.

### III. Confidentiality and Discretion
Practitioners must maintain confidentiality concerning their magical work, the spiritual entities they commune with, and the secrets passed down through generations.
