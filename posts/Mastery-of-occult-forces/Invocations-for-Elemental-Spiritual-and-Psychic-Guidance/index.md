In the presence of the sacred flame, I summon the transformative power of Fire. Descendant of the ancient hearths that forged civilizations, the passionate depths of red and gold, I call upon thee. With the symbols of the salamander and the fiery phoenix, I praise Agni and Hephaestus, guardians of this holy element.

In this twilight hour, I herald the Waxing Crescent Moon, the illustrious growing light in the darkness. Associated with rebirth and symbolic of the feminine, budding potential, I align with Hathor and Diana, patrons of this lunar phase.

In this time of growth, the Waxing Crescent empowers me to strengthen my intention and step toward my dreams with excitement and anticipation.

As the moon's luminance grows, so too does my gratitude. I vow to deepen my understanding and affinity with this guiding force. Amen.

With the endurance of mountains and the stability of foundations, I summon the Earth's manifestation force found in the Pentacle. Symbolized by Earth's brown and green hues and deities Gaia and Geb, it represents grounding and physical reality.

Strengthened by the Pentacle, I embrace provision and security in all areas of my life. Spirits and energies manifest, working harmoniously to create real and lasting change.

From the depths of my heart, I give thanks for the Pentacle's presence and commit to furthering my control over this extraordinary force. Ashe.
