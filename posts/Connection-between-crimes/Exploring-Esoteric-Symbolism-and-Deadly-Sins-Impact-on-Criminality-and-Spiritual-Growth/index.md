To address this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the core concepts involved: the seven deadly sins, esoteric symbolism, and the occult world. 

The Seven Deadly Sins, also referred to as the capital vices, are a classification of vices employed by early Christian theologians. These sins are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. Traditionally, they are considered to be the roots of all forms of evil and transgression. In connection to criminal acts, these vices are often seen as motivators or underlying causes of various offenses.

Esoteric symbolism, on the other hand, refers to the use of symbols, codes, and related imagery to convey deeper, hidden meanings or truths. These symbols are not readily accessible to the uninitiated but may be deciphered, understood, and engaged by those familiar with the language of the esoteric.

The occult world encompasses the studies, practices, and beliefs relating to supernatural, mystical or paranormal matters. Occult knowledge and practices have been regarded as hidden, secretive, or exclusive, often requiring initiation and progression through various hierarchical degrees.

Now, let us delve into the correlations between criminal acts and the seven deadly sins within the context of esoteric symbolism, and explore how these associations can influence an individual's initiation into the depths of the occult world.

1. Pride:
Pride is often symbolized by the lion, the king of the animal kingdom, representing an individual's hubris. In connection to criminal acts, pride can lead to the belief in one's superiority and invulnerability, resulting in crimes of power and control such as abuse and manipulation. In esoteric symbolism, the lion can represent the temptation of the ego to dominate, and the initiate's ability to overcome this vice demonstrates their growth in spiritual wisdom and true self-mastery.

2. Envy:
Envy is symbolized by the serpent, primarily for its association with the Garden of Eden tale. Crimes driven by envy include theft, fraud, and deception, arising from an insatiable desire for what one does not possess. The serpent's symbolism as a source of hidden knowledge can be seen in an individual's initiation into the occult world, where overcoming envy entails understanding one's path and respecting the spiritual journey of others.

3. Wrath:
Wrath is exemplified by the symbol of the wolf, an animal often associated with aggression and fury. Crimes fueled by wrath include acts of violence, assault, or destruction. In esoteric symbolism, the wolf can also represent the untamed aspect of one's psyche. The individual's initiation into the occult world may involve confronting and eventually integrating this energy, resulting in a heightened state of control and spiritual prowess.

4. Sloth:
Sloth is depicted by the snail, a creature known for its slow pace. Crimes connected to sloth are often marked by negligence, inaction, or omission. On the esoteric level, the snail represents the slow and steady accumulation of wisdom, which can be stifled or thwarted by an individual's laziness. Transformation in the occult realm requires dedication and discipline, pushing beyond complacency and comfort zones.

5. Greed:
Greed is symbolized by the toad, a creature often associated with dark, damp environments, and occasionally considered to be a harbinger of bad luck. Crimes arising from greed encompass theft, embezzlement, and fraud, driven by an excessive desire for material wealth. In esoteric symbolism, the toad often represents the darker aspects of the human psyche connected to the material plane. Overcoming greed in the context of the occult world entails embracing spiritual and mystical pursuits beyond material desires.

6. Gluttony:
Gluttony is represented by the pig, an animal associated with indulgence and excess. Crimes linked to gluttony can include substance abuse, theft, and recklessness. The pig's esoteric symbolism highlights the constant struggle of maintaining the balance between one's physical appetites, and the pursuit of higher spiritual truths. In the occult world, transcending gluttony might involve fasting or similarly restrictive practices to promote focus and spiritual growth.

7. Lust:
Lust is embodied by the symbol of the goat, an animal often correlated with carnal desire and indulgence. Crimes inspired by lust encompass sexual offenses, human trafficking, and other acts driven by sensual gratification. In esoteric symbolism, the goat signifies the primal aspects of human nature and the interspersed connection between sexuality and spirituality. Through initiation into the occult, an individual may learn to channel or transform their sensual energy into spiritual power or insight, transcending lustful temptations.

In conclusion, the correlations between criminal acts and the seven deadly sins within the context of esoteric symbolism reveal a common theme: overcoming vices and weaknesses, leading to individual growth and spiritual development. By recognizing and addressing one's temptations, limitations, and destructive inclinations, an initiate in the occult world has the potential to transform and progress along their spiritual journey, embracing both the darker and lighter aspects of their being to achieve a state of balance and self-mastery.
