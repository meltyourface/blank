  3. Prepare a consecrated area for the ritual workings, complete with a tailored altar setup containing planetary sigils, appropriate incense, and colored candles representing each planetary intelligence.

  6. Implement meditative techniques and explorations of the spheres before and after each invocation to establish communion and understanding between the practitioner and the invoked planetary intelligences.

---**Step 1**: Gathering Information on Planetary Intelligences

From Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, we can derive the following details on the seven planetary intelligences:

1. Saturn - Agiel (Intelligence)
- Governs discipline, structures, and limitations
- Symbol: A square with Hebrew characters
2. Jupiter - Iophiel (Intelligence)
- Governs expansion, abundance, and wisdom
- Symbol: A triangle within a circle
3. Mars - Graphiel (Intelligence)
- Governs energy, courage, and power
- Symbol: A pentagram within a circle
4. Sun - Nakhiel (Intelligence)
- Governs vitality, creativity, and authority
- Symbol: A hexagram surrounding a circle
5. Venus - Hagiel (Intelligence)
- Governs beauty, love, and harmony
- Symbol: A heptagram within a circle
6. Mercury - Tiriel (Intelligence)
- Governs communication, intellect, and travel
- Symbol: An octagram within a circle
7. Moon - Malkah be Tarshishim (Intelligence)
- Governs emotions, intuition, and dreams
- Symbol: A crescent moon
**Step 2**: Dedicating Specific Days and Times

Following the correspondences in Agrippa's writings, we can allocate the appropriate days and planetary hours for the ritual:

1. Saturn - Saturday
2. Jupiter - Thursday
3. Mars - Tuesday
4. Sun - Sunday
5. Venus - Friday
6. Mercury - Wednesday
7. Moon - Monday
**Step 3**: Preparing the Consecrated Area

Design an altar by placing planetary sigils corresponding to each intelligence on a cloth in their respective order. Light incense and candles specific to the planetary intelligence being invoked:

1. Saturn - Indigo candle, myrrh incense
2. Jupiter - Blue candle, cedar incense
3. Mars - Red candle, dragon's blood incense
4. Sun - Gold candle, frankincense incense
5. Venus - Green candle, rose incense
6. Mercury - Orange candle, lavender incense
7. Moon - Silver candle, sandalwood incense
**Step 4**: Invocations

Craft invocations that incorporate Agrippa's linguistic style. Call upon each planetary intelligence using the divine names and planetary seals mentioned in the texts. Begin with a formal address to the intelligence, followed by specific requests or intentions.
**Step 5**: Ritual Tools

Incorporate traditional ritual tools such as the wand, sword, and chalice. Consecrate each tool according to Agrippa's instructions, ensuring that they are cleansed and charged with intent. Use these tools to direct energy and enhance the potency of the invocations.
**Step 6**: Meditation and Sphere Exploration

Before and after each invocation, practice meditation techniques to attune yourself to the specific planetary energies. Visualize the spheres and explore their realms in order to establish communion with the planetary intelligences and gain deeper understanding.
**Step 7**: Ritual Conclusion

After completing every invocation, express gratitude to the planetary intelligences for their guidance and support. Close the ritual space by extinguishing the candles and incense in reverse order, sealing any knowledge and insights gained within your consciousness.
