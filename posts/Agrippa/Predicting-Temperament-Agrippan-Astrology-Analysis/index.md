excerpt: Predict a person's temperament by analyzing their natal chart utilizing the Agrippan system of attributing planetary influences, elemental associations, and aspects to astrological signs, while considering the Three Books of Occult Philosophy to unlock hidden insights into their personality and disposition.

To predict a person's temperament using the Agrippan system, we need to analyze their natal chart. A natal chart is a map of the positions of the planets and stars at the time of a person's birth. Before we begin, we need the exact time, date, and place of birth to create an accurate natal chart. For this example, let's assume we have that information.

1. Determine the major planets in the person's chart.
The major planets include Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Each of these celestial bodies has specific characteristics and influences. According to Agrippa, these planets are related to the Seven Classical Planets.

2. Determine the astrological signs.
The astrological signs are the twelve divisions of the zodiac, and the position of the planets in these signs will influence a person's temperament. Assign the planets to the appropriate zodiac signs in the natal chart.

3. Assign elemental associations.
Each astrological sign is associated with one of the four elements - Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. To further analyze a person's temperament, combine the planetary influences with the elemental associations. For example, if a person's chart is predominantly influenced by Water and their Sun is in Cancer, they will have a deep emotional side to their personality.

4. Analyze the aspects in the chart.
Aspects are angles formed between different celestial bodies in the natal chart, and they indicate how the energies of the planets interact. Major aspects include conjunctions, sextiles, squares, trines, and oppositions. Consider how the aspects relate to the person's temperament.

5. Interpret the findings.
Taking into account all the planetary influences, astrological signs, elemental associations, and aspects, interpret the person's temperament. Consider the balance of elements, the dominance of specific planets, and the presence of harmonious or challenging aspects.

For example, if the person's chart has a strong presence of Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), and their Mars is dominant, they might have a fiery, passionate temperament. If they have many harmonious aspects, they might be able to channel their energy positively; on the other hand, challenging aspects might lead to impulsiveness or conflict.

6. Consulting the Three Books of Occult Philosophy.
To uncover hidden insights, refer to the "Three Books of Occult Philosophy" by Agrippa for more detailed esoteric knowledge. These books hold a wealth of information on astrology, elemental associations, planetary influences, and the interpretation of a person's temperament.

As with any divination system or method, it is important to remember that every individual is unique. The Agrippan analysis of the natal chart serves as a starting point for understanding an individual's temperament. By drawing on the occult knowledge of Agrippa and the Three Books of Occult Philosophy, we can gain profound insights into a person's personality and disposition.
