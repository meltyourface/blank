The correct answer is:
- The three worlds exist in a hierarchical structure, with each world exerting influence upon the one below.

**Explanation**:
In Agrippa's "Three Books of Occult Philosophy," the three worlds – Natural, Celestial, and Intellectual – are presented as distinct yet interconnected realms that form the basis of occult understanding and practice. Agrippa drew heavily upon Neoplatonic and Hermetic thought and presented a worldview that blends philosophy, magic, and religion.

The Natural World is considered the most basic and tangible of the three realms. It is comprised of the physical, visible aspects of the world, such as the earth, plants, animals, and human beings. It is also referred to as the Elemental World.

The Celestial World, also known as the world of the spheres, is comprised of the higher forces of the universe – the planets, stars, and heavenly bodies. According to Agrippa, the Celestial World exerts influence over the Natural World through astrological and energetic correspondence. The celestial bodies, in turn, receive their influence from higher, more sublime sources, which are found in the Intellectual World.

The Intellectual World is considered the highest and most abstract of the three realms. It is the realm of pure thoughts, divine ideas, and spiritual entities, such as angels, archangels, and other divine beings. This world emanates from the divine, perfect source known as the One or the Monad and influences both the Celestial and Natural Worlds.

The hierarchical structure proposed by Agrippa suggests that the Intellectual World has the most influence, as it governs both the Celestial and Natural Worlds. The Celestial World, in turn, exerts influence over the Natural World. This concept is reflected in the famous Hermetic axiom, "As above, so below," illustrating that the patterns and structures from the Intellectual and Celestial Worlds are mirrored within the Natural World.

In conclusion, Agrippa's "Three Books of Occult Philosophy" presents a view that the Natural, Celestial, and Intellectual Worlds exist in a hierarchical structure, with each world exerting influence upon the one below. This relationship between the realms is a key component of his esoteric worldview, which blends together aspects of Neoplatonic, Hermetic, and other philosophical and religious traditions.
