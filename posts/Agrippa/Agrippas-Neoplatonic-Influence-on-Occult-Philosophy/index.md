Answer: Agrippa's emphasis on Neoplatonism and its impact on his Three Books of Occult Philosophy.

**Explanation**: Although all of the options presented have some impact on understanding the scope of Agrippa's influence on occult philosophy and practice, his emphasis on Neoplatonism and how it impacts his Three Books of Occult Philosophy plays a crucial role in understanding his work as a whole.

Neoplatonism is a philosophical system that has its roots in the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato and was further developed by later thinkers such as Plotinus. This system posits that the material world is a reflection or emanation of a higher, non-material realm of pure forms, or archetypes. The central goal of Neoplatonic thought is to understand and eventually unify oneself with this higher reality.

Agrippa's emphasis on Neoplatonism can be seen throughout his magnum opus, The Three Books of Occult Philosophy. In the first book, Agrippa focuses on natural magic, which he associates with the Neoplatonic concept of the world as an interconnected web of sympathies and antipathies. In this regard, the practice of natural magic is seen as a means of understanding and manipulating these connections to achieve specific outcomes.

The second book of Occult Philosophy delves into celestial magic and the relationship between the microcosm (individuals) and the macrocosm (the universe as a whole). This again aligns with Neoplatonic ideas, as Agrippa posits that understanding the connections between the individual and cosmic levels allows for greater comprehension and harmony with the divine.

In the third book, Agrippa examines ceremonial magic – theurgy and goetia – which he aligns directly with Neoplatonic practices such as the invocation of divine beings. The goal of ceremonial magic, again, is to align oneself with the divine and ultimately achieve unity with the higher reality.

By incorporating Neoplatonism into his works, Agrippa created a cohesive theoretical framework for understanding different branches of occult knowledge. This made his works more accessible and appealing to a wide range of readers, contributing to their lasting influence in the field of the esoteric. His synthesis of Neoplatonic thought with other branches of knowledge, such as Hermeticism, alchemy, and Jewish mysticism, placed him at the forefront of the Western esoteric tradition.

In conclusion, Agrippa's emphasis on Neoplatonism and its impact on his Three Books of Occult Philosophy plays a crucial role in understanding the scope of his influence on occult philosophy and practice. This philosophical and theoretical foundation enabled Agrippa to marry various esoteric disciplines, establish the interconnectedness of different branches of occult knowledge, and create a comprehensive system with which to engage and understand the mysteries of the universe.
