To address this knowledge challenge, we must first understand Agrippa's threefold division within De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres and then analyze how it contributes to our understanding of the microcosm and macrocosm relationship. Following this, we will discuss how this relationship can be utilized in practical occultism to manifest real-world change.

Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres, or "Three Books of Occult Philosophy," is a foundational work in the Western esoteric tradition that outlines a comprehensive system of magic and philosophical thought. It presents a threefold division of the interconnected worlds: Natural, Celestial, and Intellectual.

1. Natural World: This encompasses the physical and material realm consisting of the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire), along with the various life forms, including plants, animals, and minerals. Here, the forces of nature dominate, and its study is primarily concerned with natural magic - the manipulation of these elemental and material forces.

2. Celestial World: This relates to the intermediate realm between the material and immaterial worlds, including the heavenly bodies such as planets, stars, and constellations. It deals with celestial or astral magic, which is based on the understanding of planetary influences and energies. The seven classical planets govern various aspects of human life and the natural world, and the manipulation of these energies could bring about change.

3. Intellectual World: This encompasses the immaterial or spiritual realm where divine entities, angels, and other higher beings reside. It also refers to spiritual or divine magic, which focuses on establishing direct contact and communication with these higher powers to obtain guidance and influence reality.

Now that we have an understanding of the threefold division, we can examine how it contributes to the microcosm-macrocosm relationship. The microcosm represents the individual or the smaller, enclosed sphere of existence (such as the human body), while the macrocosm represents the larger, universal sphere of existence (like the cosmos).

Agrippa's threefold division emphasizes that the division isn't a rigid structure; instead, it demonstrates an interconnected web of existence. Events and influences in one world affect the other two; thus, the microcosm (individual) is connected to the macrocosm (cosmos) through these levels. By understanding and working within these interconnected worlds, one becomes aware of the correspondence of energies and qualities through the microcosm and macrocosm.

Applying this understanding in practical occultism can help individuals manifest real-world change. It is based on the Hermetic principle, "As above, so below," which states that the microcosm reflects the macrocosm and vice versa. Practical occultism uses this relationship through rituals, invocations, and other techniques to sync with these energetic correspondences. By doing so, individuals can directly influence their immediate surroundings or personal circumstances within the natural world.

In summary, Agrippa's threefold division of the interconnected worlds of the Natural, Celestial, and Intellectual in De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres contributes to our understanding of the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm. This relationship follows the principle of "As above, so below," showing how an interconnected web of existence connects individuals and the cosmos. Using this understanding in practical occultism can help manifest real-world change by working with correspondences and manipulating energies across the interconnected worlds.
