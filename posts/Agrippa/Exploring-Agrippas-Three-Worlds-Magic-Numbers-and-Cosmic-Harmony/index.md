To comprehensively respond to this knowledge challenge, we will begin by thoroughly analyzing the essential principles of the three worlds as outlined in Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, followed by an examination of the properties of numbers within Agrippa's numerology and their influence on these worlds' processes. We will then conclude by highlighting the differences between Agrippa's views on magic compared to prevailing perspectives during his time.

Essential Principles of the Three Worlds:

1. Elementary World: The Elementary World, as defined by Agrippa, is comprised of the four elements - Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. These elements serve as the foundation for all matter and are interconnected, with each element possessing its unique properties and qualities. The Elementary World is closely connected to the natural world and the processes that take place within it, from the growth of plants and animals to the formation of minerals and other substances. It represents the tangible, physical world that we experience with our senses.

2. Celestial World: The Celestial World, or the heavenly realm, is comprised of celestial bodies such as the stars, planets, and the Moon. This world is seen as a higher plane of existence, connected to divine order and cosmic harmony. Agrippa believed that the movements of these celestial bodies had a direct influence on the human world, events, and individual destinies. The Celestial World serves as a mediator between the Elementary World and the Intellectual World, transferring divine wisdom and energies from the higher world to the lower.

3. Intellectual World: The highest realm, the Intellectual World, is the domain of abstract principles, divine ideas, and spiritual realities. It is the source of pure wisdom and knowledge that governs the workings of both the Elementary World and the Celestial World. The Intellectual World is associated with the divine mind, the ultimate source of all things within creation, transcending time and space.

Connection between Numerology and the Three Worlds:

Agrippa's numerology draws upon the Pythagorean and Neoplatonic beliefs in the significance and power of numbers. Numbers are seen as the building blocks of reality, holding archetypal and divine symbolism that translates into the fabric of the universe. In Agrippa's numerology, each number is assigned a specific set of qualities, attributes, and energies which have a deep connection to the three worlds:

1. Numbers in the Elementary World: In Agrippa's numerology, the qualities of the numbers directly correspond to the properties found in the Elementary World's four elements. For example, the number one relates to unity and individuation, reflecting the nature of the element Earth. Other numbers (and their corresponding elements) include two (Water - duality, balance), three (Air - communication, dynamism), and four (Fire - creative energy, stability).

2. Numbers in the Celestial World: Celestial energies and influences are assigned to numbers, tying the motions of celestial bodies to the qualities contained in numerology. For instance, the number seven, which carries spiritual and divine symbolism, is associated with the seven classical planets of astrology. The connections between these numbers and celestial bodies extend to their influence on an individual's destiny, personality, and major life events.

3. Numbers in the Intellectual World: The numbers within Agrippa's numerology also have a deep connection with the world of ideas, reflecting universal principles and the divine wisdom found in the Intellectual World. Numbers become abstract concepts representing higher forms of truth and reflecting the perfect order inherent in creation.

Differences between Agrippa's View of Magic and Prevailing Perspectives:

Agrippa's view of magic differs from the prevailing perspectives of his time in several ways:

1. Holistic Approach: Agrippa saw magic as a holistic discipline encompassing the understanding of the natural, celestial, and intellectual worlds. This approach stands in contrast to the more fragmented and specialized practices common during his time, where many magicians and occultists focused on specific aspects of magic or superstitions without considering the greater context.

2. Focus on the Unity of Nature: Agrippa's understanding of the interconnectedness of the three worlds emphasized the unity and harmony of nature, moving beyond the dualistic approach that dominated many contemporary magical beliefs. He sought to transcend the separation between the spiritual and material worlds, reflecting a more complex and comprehensive view of reality.

3. Emphasis on Knowledge and Wisdom: Agrippa considered magic as a pursuit of wisdom and knowledge, rather than focusing solely on power and manipulation. He believed that true magical practice required an understanding of the inner workings of nature and the divine realm, standing in contrast to many of his contemporaries who used magic for material gain or personal influence.

In summary, Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy presents a thorough exploration of the essential principles of the three worlds - Elementary, Celestial, and Intellectual - and their interconnected nature. Agrippa's numerology establishes a deep connection between the properties of numbers, their influences on these worlds, and the processes underlying each realm. Furthermore, Agrippa's views on magic distinguish themselves from the prevailing perspectives during his time, with an emphasis on the unity of nature, holistic understanding, and the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge.
