excerpt: Devise an exhaustive compendium comprising enigmatic and arcane French esoteric nomenclature, drawing from both medieval alchemy and nineteenth-century occultism. This lexicon should contain at least 200 distinct terms, elucidating their etymology, cultural context, and application within the scholarly discourse. The compendium should also identify the key historical figures and movements that contributed to the development of each term. Lastly, incorporate cross-references and compelling examples to illustrate the intricate nuances and interdisciplinary connections of these occult terms within the realm of French scholarly studies.
