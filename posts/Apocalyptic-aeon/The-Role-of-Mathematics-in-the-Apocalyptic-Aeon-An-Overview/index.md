The increased importance of mathematics in everyday life

Within the context of the Apocalyptic Aeon, the increased importance of mathematics in everyday life is not associated with this transformative period. The Apocalyptic Aeon primarily concerns spiritual and metaphysical transformations, rather than stressing the importance of mathematical knowledge in daily life. 

The other concepts are more closely related to the esoteric and occult beliefs surrounding the Apocalyptic Aeon:
1. The rise of a global consciousness and spiritual awakening: The Apocalyptic Aeon is often thought to coincide with a widespread spiritual awakening, where humanity collectively evolves and recognizes a higher state of consciousness. This concept is common in esoteric belief systems, such as the Age of Aquarius in astrology, which is associated with humanity's shift toward greater enlightenment and spiritual growth.

2. The return of ancient gods or deities to guide humanity: In various occult and esoteric traditions, there is a belief that ancient deities or gods will return to guide humanity through the Apocalyptic Aeon. These returned deities are seen as spiritual teachers or guides who will usher in a new era of wisdom and understanding. This concept can be found in many ancient mythologies and religious texts, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Native American cosmologies.

3. The connection between astrological events and human affairs: In the context of the Apocalyptic Aeon, the belief that astrological events have a direct influence on human culture and spiritual growth is paramount. The idea that celestial happenings can signify or even catalyze significant shifts in human history is at the core of many esoteric and occult schools of thought. For example, the Mayan calendar, which accurately predicts various celestial events such as solar eclipses, is often associated with the Apocalyptic Aeon as a means to look for clues as to when this transformative period might begin.

While mathematics has certainly had increased importance in our daily lives as we progress as a society, and may even touch on various mystical traditions such as numerology, it is not inherently associated with the Apocalyptic Aeon in esoteric and occult beliefs. Instead, the Apocalyptic Aeon is mostly tied to spiritual and transcendental aspects of human consciousness, guided by divine interventions and celestial alignments.
