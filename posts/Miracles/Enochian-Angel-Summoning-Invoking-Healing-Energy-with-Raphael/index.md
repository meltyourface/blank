In this authentic Enochian angel summoning ritual, we will be invoking the angel Raphael, who is traditionally associated with healing, knowledge, and guidance. The intent behind this divine connection is to seek inspiration, promote well-being, and foster personal growth.

Preparation Process:
1. Choose an appropriate location that is quiet, free of distractions, and has a sense of sacredness. Erect a circle of protection using salt or chalk, around the circumference of the space.
2. Purify the area by burning sage or frankincense, allowing the smoke to permeate the space.
3. **Arrange the ceremonial tools**: the Enochian Sigillum Dei Aemeth, which is a talisman bearing the Enochian characters representing the names of God, a wand made of almond wood, a chalice filled with water, an incense burner, and a ceremonial dagger.

Creation of the Angel Raphael's Sigil:
1. Begin by drawing a circle that represents the divine presence.
2. Inscribe an equilateral triangle within the circle, symbolizing the holy trinity.
3. Within the triangle, draw a single eye to represent the all-seeing element of Raphael.
4. Surround the eye with the Enochian characters, spelling out the name RAPHAEL for the celestial connection.

Executing the Ritual:
1. Enter your protective circle and assume a comfortable position, facing east.
2. Close your eyes and perform a grounding meditation, visualizing a beam of light connecting you to the earth and heavens above.
3. Light the incense to establish the line of communication with angelic entities.
4. **Raise the wand towards the east, and recite the opening invocation in Enochian**: "OL SONF VORSG GOSAA I RAPHAEL, GIZ YR EE BEN VORSG ORT."
5. Draw Raphael's sigil in the air with the wand, while visualizing the angel's bright emerald green energy manifesting.
6. **Hold the chalice within your hands and intone the following Enochian chant**: "RA-ASS ZUH ZIR EOAN RA-PHA-EL, MA-REL LON-DOH ZAH ZIR OL NO PO-AM."
7. Focus on the purpose and intent of the summoning, inviting the compassionate, healing energy of Raphael to envelop you.

Expectations and Purpose:
During the ritual, you may experience a warm, loving presence, or experience visions and insights related to your intent. Raphael often manifests through subtle energy shifts, healing, and spiritual guidance. Establishing a connection with this angel can promote personal growth, aid in the healing process, and create a sense of well-being.

Safeguards and Challenges:
1. Always perform the ritual from a place of pure intent and genuine respect, focusing on the transformative energies of Raphael's presence.
2. Maintain the protective circle throughout the ceremony to guard against any negative or unintended influences.
3. In case of an unsuccessful invocation or unwanted manifestations, end the ritual by reciting the Enochian phrase, "EXARP MICAOLZ SAANIR," meaning "By the powers of the divine winds, may peace and harmony return."

Remember that miracles can manifest in various ways and always trust in the divine wisdom of the angelic realm, in this case, the guidance and healing offered by the benevolent Angel Raphael.
