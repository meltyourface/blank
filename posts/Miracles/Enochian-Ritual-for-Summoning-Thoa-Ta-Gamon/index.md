To design and execute an authentic Enochian angel summoning ritual, we must begin with thorough preparation. This includes studying the Enochian language, understanding mystical symbols and their meanings, and gathering the necessary ceremonial tools. For this ritual, let us focus on summoning the powerful Enochian angel Thoa-Ta-Gamon, a guardian angel associated with divine protection and guidance.

Required tools and materials:
1. **Enochian Circle**: A white cloth or rug inscribed with Enochian symbols to define the sacred space.
2. **Enochian Tablet or Sigillum Dei Aemeth**: A protective talisman specific to Thoa-Ta-Gamon, crafted from beeswax and engraved with the angel's sigil and Enochian characters.
3. **Ceremonial Dagger**: Also known as the "Athame," the dagger is used to trace symbols in the air and direct energy.
4. **Incense and censor**: Frankincense and myrrh, or preferred scents that align with our intentions.
5. **Candles**: Four elemental candles (earth, air, fire, water) and one central candle, preferably white or silver, to represent the divine connection.

Preparation process:
1. Choose an appropriate location and time, preferably a quiet, private space during the night or early morning.
2. Cleanse and purify the space using sage or palo santo.
3. Lay out the Enochian Circle in the center of the room and carefully position the Enochian Tablet or Sigil at the east side of the circle.
4. Place elemental candles at the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, and west) and the central candle in the middle of the circle.
5. Perform a meditation to align and balance your energy, focusing on intention and sincerity.

Ritual Execution:
1. **Begin by lighting the elemental candles, moving clockwise from the east, and the central candle last. As each candle is lit, say a brief invocation of the corresponding element in the Enochian language**:

- East (Air): "Olani od obza vaoan."
- South (Fire): "Gohed gisa dapian od vestayal."
- West (Water): "Mph arslug saanir caosgo."
- North (Earth): "Thil lorayth aldon lighal."

2. Light the incense at the censor and move it around the circle clockwise, purifying the ritual space with its fragrant smoke.

3. **Stand at the east side of the circle, holding the ceremonial dagger in your dominant hand. Trace Thoa-Ta-Gamon's sigil in the air while chanting the following Enochian invocation, calling forth the angel's presence**:

"Thoa-Ta-Gamon, malprg soboln znrza chis olora, ilasa sobame ialpor od thild. Grsco vgeg ta dsiltor od daspi luciftias ror. Zodilodarp zacam od dlugar zumrd ol qta vaoneph. Zorge coazior oled micalzo Thoa-Ta-Gamon, srge vohim gizyax!"

4. Visualize a pillar of divine light connecting to the angelic realm, drawing Thoa-Ta-Gamon's energy toward our realm.

5. When Thoa-Ta-Gamon's presence is felt, respectfully request guidance and protection, making sure to clarify your intentions and maintain reverence.

6. Thank the angel for their aid and assistance. Proceed to close the ritual by extinguishing the elemental candles, starting from the west and moving counterclockwise, and the central candle last.

Thoa-Ta-Gamon's expected manifestation may appear as a bright light, a warm sensation, or a gentle, yet firm, presence. The purpose behind establishing this divine connection is to receive guidance and protection from the angelic realm, building a relationship with Thoa-Ta-Gamon, which will aid in our spiritual growth and understanding.

Always approach angelic summoning rituals with a clear intention, respect, and humility to ensure a successful invocation and mitigate any potential challenges or unintended consequences.
