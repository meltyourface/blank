I invoke thee, O great and brilliant planetary intelligence of Venus, Aphrodite Enthroned, celestial embodiment of divine beauty, love and harmony. Emblazoned with luminescent light, I entreat you to heed my call, oh Sovereign Lady of Emerald Visions and Queen of the Seventh Sphere.

In the name of the stars that dance within your heavenly dominion, I summon your grace with the fervor of the morning dew. As the oceans rise and fall at the command of the Moon, do I now seek your radiant guidance and benevolence.

Wondrous Aphrodite, as the mirror reflects the perfection of your countenance, let the esoteric wisdom hidden within this sacred ritual reflect the true nature of your essence. ****With the sound of the conch shells that herald your gentle tides, I beseech you****: may the Rose that is your heart blossom in the center of our rite.

As the honeyed mead drips from thy golden goblet, let its sweet nectar nourish my soul, engendering the flowering of my very being. With the sign of the Pentacle, I do seal our pact; engraved upon the shimmering firmament, its celestial angles echo the harmony of your radiant domain.

Beneath the splendid rays of thy guidance, O Divinely Ordained Paragon of Passion, I call upon your miracles to manifest. Unlock the verdant chambers of my heart, allowing me to love without boundaries. Strengthen the bonds between me and my fellow earthly wonders, building bridges over the chasms of disunity. Imbue my spirit with the ecstatic power of creation, and let me bring forth beauty and splendor in all that I touch.

By the light of the Evening Star, which is your radiant symbol in the firmament, I mark this sacred space. Let the five-petaled Flower of Venus, drawn in vibrant shades of emerald, serve as our pathway to your realm of celestial beauty. May the ruby seal with the sigil of Venus, lovingly pressed to my breast, serve as a beacon for our communion.

I banish all partings and separations. I banish all discord and strife. In your sacred name, let unity and harmony prevail. May the serried ranks of angels – Haniel, Anael, and the spirits of beauty, love, and desire – witness and guide this miracle-working ritual.

Oh resplendent Aphrodite, Beauteous Maiden of the Foam, once this miracle has been granted and our hearts are aligned with the serenade of the cosmos, I vow to honor and revere your divine influence.

So mote it be, within this esoteric circle of light, as I bow in utmost devotion to your radiance. Mighty Venus, let your loving presence be felt, and let the miracles of your domain flourish in the present and the evermore. Amen.
