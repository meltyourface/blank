In the name of the Most High, I call upon thee, O Illuminated Ophiel, guardian intelligence of the shimmering Venus, the Morning and the Evening Star, Herald of Infinite Love and Keeper of Profound Beauty, who dost illuminate the minds and hearts of all who seek thy brilliance. Be thou here with me, present in this sacred space that I have hallowed for the fulfillment of my desires and the manifestation of thy miracles.

Through the shimmering veils of creation, I beseech thee, Aphrodite, divine goddess of love, beauty, and passion, who sings songs of desire upon our beating hearts. Hear me, O Benevolent Queen, as I summon the complex and ancient arts, to weave the silken threads of your ever-flowing essence through my humble existence.

O radiant Taurus, nurturing bull, whose fertile Earth nourishes the seeds of our hearts, and Libra, graceful scales of balance and harmony, who resolves chaos into peace, I invoke thy powerful alliance with Venus to bolster my request.

In this solemn rite, I engage the pentacle, a symbol of Venus' divine quintessence, its five points embracing the manifestation of spiritual and earthly love. O Rose of Serenity, thy sacred geometry unfolds hidden knowledge; thus, I activate its subtle power, spiraling inward, as a labyrinth of divine mysteries.

It is with such reverence that I reveal my heart's yearning. O Mighty Ophiel, I request that thou dost shine thy miracles unto me to nourish my relationships, deepen love, passion, and understanding, and uncover pathways to the hidden wisdom of the heart.

Through the enchanting allure of Venus, I beseech thee to weave the artistry of thy cosmic vibrations into my life, that I may move with elegance through the tapestries of fate and emerge resplendent, a vessel worthy of sacred communion and unbounded eros.

On this day, in this hallowed circle, I offer my fragrant libations of rose and myrrh, the sensual nectar that sings praises to your eternal exaltation. They arise, like swirling tendrils of incense, to embrace the ethereal spheres where your presence lingers, O Heavenly Sovereign of the Intimate Realms.

By the arcane knowledge revealed to me, I conjure thee, O Ophiel, to navigate the celestial paths of my destiny with thy guiding hand. Unfurl the petals of transformation within my being, unfold the dazzling essence of beauty to permeate my relationships and endeavors, opening a path for miracles to flourish.

In deepest humility, I submit my plea to thee, O Aphrodite, Goddess of Eternal Beauty, and Ophiel, Keeper of Aphrodite's Secrets, assist me in this quest. May your starlight guide me, even as I conjure your presence and favor. So mote it be.
