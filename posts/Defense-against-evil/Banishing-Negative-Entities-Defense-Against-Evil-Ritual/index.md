excerpt: >

  1. Preparation of the sacred space: Thoroughly cleanse and consecrate the area by sprinkling saltwater and burning purifying herbs such as sage or frankincense. Adorn the space with sacred symbols and protective talismans relevant to the Defense against evil domain.

  2. Invocation of protective spirits and guardians: Call upon the assistance of benevolent beings like archangels, spirit guides, or ancestral guardians to provide additional protection and strength during the banishing ritual.

  3. Formulation of a potent banishing spell: Design a unique spell or incantation that specifically targets the negative entities you wish to vanquish. Incorporate elements such as sigils or sacred words from the Defense against evil tradition.

  4. Assembling ritual tools and ingredients: Gather essential items required for the banishing ritual, including a consecrated ritual dagger, candles of specific colors, corresponding crystals, and a physical representation of the negative entity
  (a drawing or effigy, for example).

  5. Enactment of the banishing ritual: Following the step-by-step instructions, combine the elements of your spell with the use of ritual tools and physical actions. In a confident and commanding tone, recite the incantation while visualizing the expulsion of the malevolent forces.

  6. Sealing and fortification of protective barriers: Complete the ritual by reinforcing the psychic barriers around the sacred space and its occupants. Empower these barriers with the energies of your invoked guardians and the inherent strengths of the Defense against evil domain.

  7. Expressing gratitude and closing the ritual: Thank the protective spirits and guardians for their assistance, bid them farewell, and perform any necessary actions to close the ritual in a respectful and intentional manner.

1. Preparation of the sacred space:
- Start by cleaning the area where the ritual will take place. Remove any clutter and vacuum or sweep the floor.
- Mix a pinch of salt in a small bowl of purified water. Sprinkle this saltwater in the area while reciting a cleansing prayer or mantra. Example: "By the power within and around me, I cleanse this space of all negativity and impurities."
- Light a bundle of dried sage or a stick of frankincense incense and allow the smoke to fill the area.
- Place sacred symbols such as the pentacle, infinity knot, or any protective talismans relevant to your Defense against evil tradition at key points around the space.

2. Invocation of protective spirits and guardians:
- Stand at the center of the sacred space and take a few deep breaths to center yourself.
- Call upon the benevolent beings you wish to work with, such as Archangel Michael, spirit guides, or ancestral guardians.
- Recite a prayer or invocation asking for their presence, protection, and assistance during the ritual. Example: "Great Archangel Michael, guardian of light, I call upon your aid in this time of need. Protect me and guide me as I banish the darkness that lurks within."

3. Formulation of a potent banishing spell:
- Write or choose a unique spell or incantation that specifically targets the negative entities you wish to banish.
- Incorporate powerful elements from your Defense against evil tradition, such as sigils or sacred words. Example: "By the sacred power of the (insert sigil/sacred word), I command you, dark forces, to leave this place and return to the shadows from whence you came."

4. Assembling ritual tools and ingredients:
- Gather the required items: a consecrated ritual dagger, candles of specific colors (for example, black for banishing and white for protection), corresponding crystals such as black tourmaline or obsidian, and a physical representation of the negative entity (a drawing or effigy).
- Arrange these items on a central altar or table within the sacred space.

5. Enactment of the banishing ritual:
- Follow the step-by-step instructions outlined in your chosen spell.
- Light the candles and hold the ritual dagger in your dominant hand.
- Recite the incantation while visualizing the expulsion of the malevolent forces. Be confident and commanding in your tone.
- Focus your energy on the physical representation of the negative entity as you perform the ritual actions.

6. Sealing and fortification of protective barriers:
- Once the banishing is complete, reinforce the psychic barriers around the sacred space and yourself.
- Stand in the center of the area and envision a glowing shield surrounding it, growing stronger with the energies of your invoked guardians and the power of the Defense against evil domain.
- You may also recite an additional protective prayer or mantra, such as: "By the power of the light and the guardians who watch over me, I seal this space and all within it from harm."

7. Expressing gratitude and closing the ritual:
- Thank your protective spirits and guardians for their assistance, by saying something like, "I extend my deepest gratitude to (names of invoked beings) for your protection and guidance during this ritual. May you continue to watch over me as I walk my path."
- Politely bid them farewell and extinguish the candles.
- Perform any additional actions necessary to close the ritual, such as drawing a final protective sigil in the air or ringing a bell to signal the end.

8. Rest, reflection, and re-establishment of normalcy:
- After completing the banishing ritual, take time for self-care, such as a bath, meditation, or journaling about your experience.
- Ensure that positive energies are reintegrated into the space by lighting uplifting incense, playing soft music, or placing fresh flowers in the area.
- Acknowledge the successful Defense against evil and proceed with your daily activities, feeling more secure and empowered.
