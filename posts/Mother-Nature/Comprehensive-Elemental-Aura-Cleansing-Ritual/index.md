Before you begin the purification plan, it is essential to assess your current aura's state to track the impact of the elemental cleansing journey. **To assess your aura**:

1. Find a quiet, comfortable space to sit undisturbed.
2. Close your eyes and take several slow, deep breaths.
3. Visualize your aura surrounding you, a glowing outline of energy that extends around 2-3 feet from your body.
4. Allow any colors, sensations, or emotions to arise, taking mental notes or journaling your experience.
5. Repeat this process after completing the purification plan to track the changes in your aura.

Now that you have assessed your aura, follow the comprehensive elemental cleansing plan:

Earth Cleansing:
1. Find a secluded, natural setting with rich soil or a grassy patch.
2. Remove your shoes and socks to make a direct connection with the Earth.
3. Stand or sit with your spine straight, close your eyes, and breathe deeply.
4. Visualize roots extending from your feet into the Earth, connecting you with its grounding, purifying energy.
5. Feel any negativity or blockages in your aura being absorbed by the Earth.
6. Once you feel grounded and cleansed, thank the Earth for its assistance and slowly release the roots' visualization.

Water Cleansing:
1. Fill a bathtub or basin with warm water and add a cup of sea salt or Epsom salt.
2. Submerge yourself into the water, allowing the salt to dissolve and purify your aura.
3. Close your eyes, breathe deeply, and visualize the water removing any negativity or impurities.
4. Soak for 15-20 minutes, allowing the salt to purify every level of your aura.
5. Thank the element of water for its assistance and drain the tub, envisioning any negativity or impurities being washed away.

Air Cleansing:
1. Light a bundle of dried sage or use a sage-scented incense stick.
2. Stand or sit comfortably, focusing on your breath and the purifying air.
3. Using a feather or your hand, gently waft the sage smoke around your body, paying attention to your head, chest, arms, and legs.
4. Feel the air cleanse your aura, removing any stagnant energy or negativity.
5. Continue the process for 5-10 minutes until you sense a clear, light energy around you.
6. Thank the element of air for its assistance and extinguish the sage or incense.

Fire Cleansing:
1. Light a small ceremonial fire or candle with a pure, natural wax.
2. Sit comfortably, focusing on the flame and its cleansing energy.
3. Visualize the flame consuming any negativity or impurities in your aura and transforming them into pure light and warmth.
4. Spend 10-15 minutes in this meditative state, allowing the fire to purify and strengthen your aura.
5. Thank the element of fire for its assistance and extinguish the flame safely.

Once you have completed all four elemental cleansing steps, revisit the initial aura assessment process to gauge the effectiveness of the purification plan. Reflect on any changes in your aura's colors, sensations, or emotions to determine the impact of the elemental cleansing journey on your energy. Repeat this process periodically or whenever you feel a need to purify and refresh your aura.
