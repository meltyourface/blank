To design and construct a personalized astral temple tailored for the rigorous practice of modern ceremonial magick, we'll follow these steps:

1. ****Determining the purpose and scope of the temple****: First and foremost, the purpose of the astral temple must be established. In this case, the temple is designed to enhance magickal workings and amplify psychic and spiritual energies.

2. ****Choosing a location within the astral plane****: Select a serene and secluded location within the astral plane, preferably an elevated or inaccessible area that keeps unwanted influences at bay. Visualize this location as the grounds upon which the temple will be built.

3. ****Laying the foundational structure****: The base of the temple should be in the shape of an octagon or dodecagon, as these geometrical shapes carry significant esoteric meanings and can aid in the grounding and harmonization of energies.

4. ****Setting the cardinal directions****: Associate each of the corners of the temple with the four elemental points (North, East, South, and West). ****This alignment should follow traditional associations****: North - Earth, East - Air, South - Fire, and West - Water.

5. ****Incorporation of symbols and sigils****: Carve or paint relevant symbols and sigils within the temple walls and floor. This may include planetary sigils, elemental symbols, and other meaningful symbols specific to your spiritual practice.

6. ****Architectural elements****: Construct four pillars at the corners of the temple, representing the four elements and cardinal points. Additionally, create an altar in the center, which should be an elevated platform to perform rituals. Additionally, incorporate any sacred geometry patterns (e.g., the H-tree pattern) within the walls and floor, enhancing resonance with sacred energy pathways.

Now that we have designed the temple, let's outline the detailed step-by-step ritual for entering and consecrating it:

1. ****Preparation****: Begin by cleansing and grounding yourself. Light a white candle and incense (preferably frankincense) and sit in a quiet, dimly lit space.

2. ****Protect yourself****: Cast a circle of protection around you by visualizing a sphere of light engulfing your entire space. Call upon any protective entities or deities that you work with.

3. ****Astral projection****: Relax and engage in your preferred method of astral projection, allowing your consciousness to leave your physical body and enter the astral plane.

4. ****Locate the temple****: Once on the astral plane, look for your temple's location. You can envision it as a bright beacon of light within the astral landscape.

5. ****Enter the temple****: Stand before the entrance of your temple and state your intention to work within its sacred boundaries. Knock thrice on the temple door, and enter.

6. ****Consecration****: Proceed to the center of the temple and light an astral representation of the white candle and frankincense. Call upon the four elemental powers - Earth, Air, Fire, and Water - and ask for their blessing and assistance in consecrating the temple.

7. ****Affirmation****: State your purpose and intention of using the astral temple for your magickal workings and the enhancement of your psychic and spiritual energies.

8. ****Sealing the energies****: Visualize a bright, golden light permeating the temple walls and floor, sealing the energies and blessings within the temple.

9. ****Thank the elements****: Offer gratitude to the four elemental powers for their assistance in consecrating the temple.

10. ****Leaving the temple****: Exit the temple and close the door behind you. Return to your physical body, taking with you the connection to your newly consecrated astral temple.

11. ****Ground and center****: Ground and center yourself by absorbing any residual energy from the temple. Then, open your circle of protection, and extinguish the candle and incense.

You can now access your personalized astral temple any time you wish to enhance your magickal workings or strengthen your psychic and spiritual energies. Remember to regularly maintain the energies and reinforce the consecrations over time.
