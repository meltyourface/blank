For the purpose of completing this task, let us examine a hypothetical Empowered talisman design intended to bring prosperity and wealth to the bearer. 

1. Assessing the effectiveness of the talisman in fulfilling its intended purpose:
In the realm of esoteric and occult knowledge, a talisman's effectiveness lies in its creator's intent, the specific energy it draws upon, and the personal belief of the wielder, among other factors. As such, this talisman incorporates sigils and symbols known to attract prosperity, which makes it effective. An example is the square of Jupiter, a powerful symbol for abundance and wealth.

2. Analyzing the choice of symbolic elements:
The design includes the following symbolic elements:
a. The square of Jupiter: As mentioned before, this symbol represents abundance and wealth and actively aligns with the talisman's intended purpose.
b. The alchemical symbol for gold: Gold has long been associated with monetary success; thus, incorporating it into the design suggests opulence and refinement.
c. The Eye of Providence: This symbol represents divine guidance and support, which is essential in ensuring the wealth attracted is used in a wise and just manner.
d. Colors: Green and gold are chosen for their associations with wealth, prosperity, growth, and financial success.

3. Evaluating the harmony and balance of the talisman with respect to sacred geometry:
The talisman demonstrates an understanding of sacred geometry by incorporating shapes like the circle, square, and triangle, which are core elements in this domain. The talisman is designed symmetrically with respect to the central axis, ensuring balance. All key symbols are arranged harmoniously, which gives an appealing appearance that reflects the intention of prosperity.

4. Suggesting potential improvements or alternative design components:
Here are some suggestions that could enhance the talisman's power or better align it with its intended purpose:
a. Add a personal touch: Incorporate the wielder's initials, birthdate, or any personal symbol into the design, as this could strengthen the connection between the talisman and the person using it.
b. Utilize sigil synthesis: A customized sigil could be created based on the person's specific intentions related to wealth and prosperity.
c. Incorporate specific planetary symbols: Symbols associated with specific planets that have a connection to wealth or abundance could be integrated, like Venus for attraction or Mercury for commerce.
d. Experiment with organic shapes: Organic shapes, like leafy vines or plants that represent growth, could be added to the design to emphasize the idea of prospering and growing wealth.

In conclusion, the given Empowered talisman design is effective in its intended purpose and incorporates symbolism and harmonious sacred geometry principles. However, it could benefit from additional customization or personalization for the wielder, and potentially include further symbolism or organic shapes related to wealth and prosperity.
