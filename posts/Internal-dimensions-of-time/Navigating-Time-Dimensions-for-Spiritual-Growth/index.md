To reconcile the concept of the Eternal Now and Dreamtime with the linear progression of time, one must first have a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and their underlying principles. Then, we can delve into specific techniques that an initiate can employ to consciously harness and navigate these internal dimensions of time for spiritual growth and personal understanding.

The Eternal Now, often associated with mysticism and Eastern philosophies such as Buddhism and Hinduism, refers to the ever-present moment, devoid of the constraints imposed by linear time. In this state, past, present, and future coexist simultaneously, allowing one to experience complete oneness with the universe and true enlightenment.

Dreamtime, a concept originating from the Aboriginal Australian culture, is a similar yet distinct concept. It encompasses the world's creation and the interconnection of all living things, transcending time and physical existence. In this spiritual realm, ancestral beings and spirits reside and continue to influence the world we live in today.

The linear progression of time, on the other hand, is our everyday experience of time, with past, present, and future unfolding in a sequential manner. This idea is grounded in both our sensory perception of reality and the scientific understanding of time based on the physics that govern the universe.

Reconciliation between these seemingly opposing concepts requires an understanding that linear time and the Eternal Now or Dreamtime can coexist, depending on the level of consciousness we experience. Linear time is critical for survival in the physical world as it helps us structure our lives, complete tasks, and interpret cause and effect. However, on a deeper, more spiritual level, eternal or cyclical time can help us go beyond the physical realm, connect with the flow of the universe, and access higher states of consciousness.

Specific techniques for an initiate to consciously harness and navigate these internal dimensions of time include:

1. Mindfulness Meditation: Practicing mindfulness meditation requires one to be fully present in the current moment, without judgment. This technique helps develop the ability to observe thoughts and emotions as they arise, without getting attached to them, thus dissolving the illusion of linear time and embracing the Eternal Now.

2. Dreamwork: Actively engaging with and interpreting dreams can help an initiate access the Dreamtime. By exploring the seemingly irrational occurrences and symbolic nature of dreams, one can tap into the collective unconscious and connect with timeless wisdom.

3. Visualization: Practicing visualization and guided imagery can enable an initiate to enter altered states of consciousness and access non-linear time. Building mental models of dreamlike or mystical experiences can help break free from the confines of linear time and transcend into the Eternal Now or Dreamtime.

4. Rituals and Ceremonies: Engaging in rituals and ceremonies can create a sacred space where both linear and non-linear time coexist, allowing the initiate to traverse between physical and spiritual realms.

5. Study of Sacred Texts: Delving into ancient scriptures and esoteric wisdom can help an initiate gain understanding and insight into the deeper layers of existence, where time operates in a non-linear fashion.

In conclusion, to reconcile the Eternal Now and Dreamtime with the linear progression of time, we must understand that these concepts can coexist and function at different levels of consciousness. By employing techniques such as mindfulness meditation, dreamwork, visualization, rituals, and the study of sacred texts, an initiate can consciously harness and navigate these internal dimensions of time for spiritual growth and personal understanding. These practices will enable them to bridge the gap between the physical world governed by linear time and the spiritual world of eternal or cyclical time, ultimately leading them to a more profound connection to their true self and the universe.
