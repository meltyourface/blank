The publication of the Taxil hoax, which falsely accused Freemasons of devil worship.

The Taxil hoax, perpetrated by French author LÃ©o Taxil in the late 19th century, is a significant event in the history of Anti-Masonry, as it contributed to the wide dissemination of conspiracy theories and intensified opposition to the Freemasonry. Taxil published a series of books and articles that falsely accused Freemasons of engaging in Satanic rituals and devil worship.

This hoax instilled fear and suspicion in many people, particularly within the devout Catholic population. The Catholic Church had long been wary of Freemasonry due to its secretive nature and the promotion of Enlightenment values such as secularism and liberalism. The Taxil hoax further fueled this mistrust, and some people still believe these false claims today.

While the other events listed have also had roles in shaping perceptions of Freemasonry, they have not had as significant an impact in terms of disseminating conspiracy theories and intensifying opposition to the organization. The death of Mozart created some suspicion, but it did not reach the same level of influence as the Taxil hoax.

The movie "National Treasure" did popularize certain theories about the Knights Templar and Freemasons, but these conspiracies existed long before the film, and their impact on Anti-Masonry sentiment has been more limited. Lastly, the founding of Skull and Bones, while also contributing to conspiracy theories, relates more to a specific subset of secretive societies, and its connection with Freemasonry is often incorrectly conflated.

In conclusion, the Taxil hoax was a major turning point in the promotion of Anti-Masonry sentiment. Through false claims of Satanism and devil worship, this series of publications sparked widespread fear and suspicion, the effects of which are still felt today.
