In analyzing the historical roots and evolution of Anti-Masonry, it is essential to first define the term. Anti-Masonry refers to the opposition, mistrust, and criticism of the Freemasonic fraternity and its practices, principles, and influence in society. The development of Anti-Masonry as a social and political movement can be traced back to several key underlying factors, forms, and manifestations, as well as specific events, individuals, and philosophies that have shaped its thought and action throughout history.

The emergence of Anti-Masonry can be attributed to three primary factors: (1) Fear and suspicion of the secretive nature of Freemasonry, (2) religious and ideological opposition to the fraternity's perceived infringement on established faiths and social orders, and (3) a more general aversion to secret societies and influential organizations.

One of the earliest forms of Anti-Masonry can be found in the writings and sermons of religious figures in the 18th and 19th centuries, who perceived Freemasonry as a threat to their faith and institutions. For example, Pope Clement XII issued the Papal Bull "In Eminenti" in 1738, condemning Freemasonry as a harmful and subversive secret society. Throughout the years, several other popes followed suit, reinforcing the Catholic Church's stance against the fraternity.

Another form of Anti-Masonry took shape in the 19th-century United States with the emergence of the Anti-Masonic Party, which was mainly driven by political and religious concerns. The kidnapping and suspected murder of former Freemason William Morgan in 1826 fueled a massive wave of Anti-Masonry. Morgan had published a book revealing supposed secrets of the fraternity, and his disappearance led many to believe that he had been silenced by fellow Masons. In this climate of suspicion, the Anti-Masonic Party articulated its opposition to the fraternity, calling for rollbacks of Masonic influence in public life.

In terms of philosophical influences, Anti-Masonry often intersects with conspiracy theories that posit a world under the control of secretive, powerful, and malicious groups. Influenced by works such as John Robison's "Proofs of a Conspiracy" (1797) and Augustin Barruel's "Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism" (1797-98), some Anti-Masons attributed the French Revolution and other major historical events to certain secret societies, including the Freemasons.

Throughout history, various prominent individuals have been associated with Anti-Masonry. Some of these figures include author Leo Tolstoy, who criticized the fraternity's secretive nature, and writer G.K. Chesterton, who expressed concern about the influence of Freemasonry on British society. In Nazi Germany, Anti-Masonry was also prevalent, as Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich saw Freemasonry as part of the so-called 'Jewish conspiracy.'

As for its impact on both Freemasonry and broader society, Anti-Masonry has resulted in periods of social and political turmoil, particularly during the height of the Anti-Masonic Party in the United States. In some countries, such as Italy and Romania, Anti-Masonry led to the expulsion and persecution of Freemasons.

To summarize, the historical roots and evolution of Anti-Masonry can be traced back to several key factors, including fear and suspicion of Freemasonry's secretive nature, religious and ideological opposition, and general aversion to secret societies and influential organizations. Throughout history, various forms and manifestations of Anti-Masonry have emerged, with specific events, individuals, and philosophical influences shaping its thought and action. The impact of Anti-Masonry on Freemasonry and the broader society cannot be understated, as it has led to social and political upheaval, as well as periods of persecution and marginalization of Freemasons.
