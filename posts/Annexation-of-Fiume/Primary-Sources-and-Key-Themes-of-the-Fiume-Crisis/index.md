Due to the limitations of this platform, it is not possible to physically compile an extensive collection of primary sources. However, I can provide you with a list of potential primary sources to research. Additionally, I can outline some of the key viewpoints and events surrounding the Annexation of Fiume and the Fiume Crisis.

Primary Sources:

1. Correspondence between the various governments involved in the crisis, including Italy, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.
2. Personal letters, diaries, and memoirs of key political figures such as Italian poet and nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio, Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando, and Yugoslavian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić.
3. Newspaper articles and editorials from Italian, Yugoslav, American, French, and British newspapers.
4. Records of diplomatic meetings and conferences, such as the Paris Peace Conference or the Treaty of Rapallo.
5. Speeches and public statements made by politicians and other prominent figures regarding the Fiume Crisis.

Key Themes and Perspectives:

1. ****Italian irredentism and nationalism****: Many Italians saw the annexation of Fiume as an opportunity to fulfill dreams of a greater Italy, incorporating irredentist territories inhabited by ethnic Italians.

2. ****Wilson’s Fourteen Points and self-determination****: U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's principle of national self-determination played a significant role in shaping the Fiume Crisis, as it raised questions about whether Fiume should join Italy or the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.

3. ****Conflicting Entente interests****: France and the UK had their interests in the Adriatic region, leading to contrasting opinions on how the Fiume Crisis should be resolved.

4. ****Yugoslav nationalism and opposition****: The government and people of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes were fiercely opposed to Italian attempts to annex Fiume, seeing it as Yugoslav territory.

Shifts in Sentiment and Underrepresented Viewpoints:

1. Initially, there was widespread support for Italian claims to Fiume, particularly among Italian nationalists. However, as the crisis dragged on and led to violence and instability, support for the annexation waned both domestically and internationally.

2. Gabriele D'Annunzio's occupation of Fiume added an element of radicalism to the crisis not often represented in traditional accounts. His actions may have influenced the decision of the Entente powers to resolve the dispute through diplomacy instead of military intervention.

3. Diplomatic negotiations ultimately led to the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920, which established the Free State of Fiume as a compromise solution. This outcome represented a shift in sentiment from the initial irredentist desires towards a more pragmatic approach to resolving the crisis, particularly from Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.

In conclusion, an extensive collection of primary sources on the Fiume Crisis would reveal various international reactions and political implications surrounding the Annexation of Fiume. By analyzing these sources, one can identify key themes, contrasting perspectives, and shifts in sentiment, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of this complex historical event.
