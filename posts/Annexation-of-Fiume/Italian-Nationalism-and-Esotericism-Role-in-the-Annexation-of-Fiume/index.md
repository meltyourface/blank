The connection between Italian nationalism and esoteric secret societies

The Annexation of Fiume, otherwise known as the Impresa di Fiume, took place in 1919 and involved the capture of the city of Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia) by Gabriele D'Annunzio, an Italian poet and adventurer, and his supporters. This event came at the end of World War I when the Kingdom of Italy sought to expand its territory despite inconclusive territorial settlements from the Treaty of Versailles.

Among the factors related to the occult and esoteric mentioned in the question, the connection between Italian nationalism and esoteric secret societies played a significant role in the events surrounding the Annexation of Fiume. During this time, Italy saw the rise of various groups and secret societies with nationalistic and esoteric leanings, such as the Carbonari and the Italian Irredentism movement.

The Carbonari were a revolutionary group with links to Freemasonry, who sought to promote Italian unification and liberal values. They were involved in numerous conspiracy and insurrection attempts throughout the 19th century, and their influence could be felt in Italy's desire to expand its territories after World War I.

Italian Irredentism was a movement that aimed to unify all Italian-speaking territories into a single nation. This movement had esoteric undertones and was intertwined with the idea of the "New Man," a concept that derived from various occult roots, including Theosophy and the work of Helena Blavatsky. The concept of the New Man was later incorporated into the ideologies of both D'Annunzio and Benito Mussolini.

Gabriele D'Annunzio himself was known for being well-versed in esoteric and occult traditions, and his political beliefs were influenced by the works of figures such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Gabriele Rossetti.

To sum up, the connection between Italian nationalism and esoteric secret societies played a significant role in the events surrounding the Annexation of Fiume because they formed an ideological foundation for people like D'Annunzio who aspired to create a unified Italy with expanded territories. Moreover, the esoteric element provided an additional layer of emotional and symbolic appeal, which further motivated these individuals to undertake revolutionary actions.
