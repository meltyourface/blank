To fully comprehend the multifaceted perspectives and historical contexts surrounding the Annexation of Fiume, we must first understand the basics of this historical event. The Annexation of Fiume occurred in 1924 when the Italian Regency of Carnaro, a self-proclaimed state founded by the Italian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, seized control of the city of Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia). This event took place within the broader context of World War I's aftermath, as the Treaty of Rapallo was being formed to redraw the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire, which left the city's fate uncertain.

Key Themes and Ideas:
1. **Annexation of Fiume**: A manifestation of the diverse political and social currents of the post-WWI era, with the city facing an uncertain future.
2. **Gabriele D'Annunzio**: A charismatic figure, whose esoteric and occult inclinations influenced the movement and contributed to the development of the Regency of Carnaro.
3. **Occult influences**: The role that esoteric beliefs played in shaping the political landscape, specifically the connections between Fiuman irredentism and Thelema.

Before diving into the occult influences, let's explore Gabriele D'Annunzio's character and the historical context. D'Annunzio was an influential poet, dramatist, and novelist. He was a fervent nationalist, standing for irredentism – the movement seeking to reunite all Italian-speaking territories under one nation. During World War I, he was a vocal advocate for the Italian war effort. Not satisfied with the outcome of the treaty negotiations, he formed the Italian Regency of Carnaro and set off on the path of self-aggrandizing conquest, leading to the Annexation of Fiume.

D'Annunzio's esoteric and occult traditions influenced his leadership and the ideology of the Regency of Carnaro. He was known to be fascinated by various forms of occultism, which informed both his literary works and his political project. Some of his works, such as the novel "Il Piacere" and the play "Francesca da Rimini," contained elements of esotericism and occultism.

It is within this occult background that we can explore the connections between the Annexation of Fiume and Thelema. Thelema is a spiritual philosophy centered around the concept of discovering and asserting one's True Will. Developed by English author Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, it is based on the idea that the laws of nature require the strong to rule over the weak and that individuals must strive to discover their True Will. This doctrine was, in many ways, consistent with D'Annunzio's own beliefs about the destiny of the Italian people and the role that the Regency of Carnaro should play in achieving Italian unity.

The intertwining of these two threads – the political movement of Fiuman irredentism and the spiritual path of Thelema – create a potent mixture used to craft the Regency of Carnaro's ideology and the basis of its quest for territorial expansion. Fiuman irredentism can thus be viewed as a manifestation of the Thelemic principles of asserting one's True Will, as it strove to achieve a united Italy in the face of powerful external forces and geopolitical uncertainty.

In conclusion, the Annexation of Fiume can be seen as a complex interplay of forces: a political movement driven by Gabriele D'Annunzio's charismatic leadership and irredentist ideology and fueled by his fascination with occultism and esoteric beliefs, particularly Thelema. By examining the key themes and ideas of this event, we can see it as a culmination of these influences, where Fiuman irredentism sought to assert its True Will by seeking the unification of all Italian-speaking territories.
