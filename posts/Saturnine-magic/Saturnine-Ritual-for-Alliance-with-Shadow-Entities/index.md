excerpt: Develop an intricate, multi-step Saturnine ritual to conjure and present an appropriate ceremonial offering, utilizing obsidian crystals and the sigil of Binah, to appease and establish an alliance with the enigmatic entities residing under the influence of the planet Saturn.
---**Step 1**: Preparing the Sacred Space

To begin the ritual, select an area where you can perform the ceremony undisturbed. Once the location is chosen, cleanse the area with a mixture of salt and water while reciting a purification incantation. After cleansing, draw a circle on the ground large enough for you to stand or sit comfortably within. Within the circle, inscribe the sigil of Binah in the center.
**Step 2**: Gathering the Necessary Tools and Ingredients

For this Saturnine ritual, gather the following items:
- Three obsidian crystals, previously cleansed and charged under the light of Saturn.
- A black or indigo ceremonial cloth to lay over the sigil of Binah.
- A bowl or chalice made of a dark material, such as onyx or blackened silver, to hold the offering.
- A mixture of dried herbs associated with Saturn, such as myrrh, patchouli, and hematite powder.
- A dark, aged spirit, ideally one distilled or aged during a Saturn retrograde period, to serve as a libation.
- One black candle, a lighter or matches, and a small silver ceremonial knife for carving the candle.
**Step 3**: Casting the Ritual Circle

At the edge of the sacred space, place the three obsidian crystals at intervals that form an equilateral triangle around the sigil of Binah. Light the black candle, and carve the astrological symbol of Saturn into the side with the silver knife.

Once this is complete, stand at the edge of the sacred space, and invoke the powers of Saturnine magic with the following incantation:

"By the mysteries of the darkened orb,
I evoke the forces of Saturn's accord.
In the Name of Binah, bring forth the entities of the shadow realm,
As I craft this rite, bound within this sacred helm."
**Step 4**: Creating the Ceremonial Offering

Lay the black or indigo cloth over the sigil of Binah within the circle. In the center, place the dark bowl or chalice. Add the dried herbs and hematite powder into the container, and then slowly pour the dark spirit over them while reciting the following:

"Entities veiled in time and space,
Accept this offering within this sacred place.
Herbs and spirits bound in harmony,
In the shadow of Saturn, let our alliance be."
**Step 5**: Sealing the Alliance

Once the offering has been made, close your eyes, and visualize the enigmatic entities of Saturn gathering around the sacred space. In your mind's eye, see them accepting your offering and feel their energies merging with your own, sealing the alliance between you. Hold this vision, and then recite:

"Sigil of Binah, obsidian stone,
I stand before you, no longer alone.
An alliance is formed, our fate intertwined,
Through the powers of Saturn, our wills now aligned."
**Step 6**: Closing the Ritual

Upon completion of the recitation, bow respectfully to acknowledge the entities. Extinguish the black candle, and then carefully dismantle the sacred space by removing the ceremonial items and crystals in reverse order from which they were placed.

Once the circle is broken, bury or scatter the remnants of the offering at the base of a nearby tree or within a body of flowing water.

You have now successfully completed your Saturnine ritual and formed an alliance with the enigmatic entities of Saturn. Remember to honor this alliance through further offerings, meditation, and exploration of Saturnine magic.
