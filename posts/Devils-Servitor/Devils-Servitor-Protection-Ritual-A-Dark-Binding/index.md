Task: Devise an intricate, Devil's Servitor-themed protection ritual to shield oneself from malevolent entities, utilizing arcane symbols, forbidden incantations, and diabolical components. Specify the step-by-step process, the timing, and the exact materials required to successfully ward off nefarious supernatural forces.
**Step 1**: Preparation
To begin the ritual, set aside a space free of distractions and intrusions, either indoors or outdoors, where you can feel comfortable working. **Timing should coincide with the dark of the moon, when its energy is at its lowest point and most receptive to your intentions. Ensure you have the following materials on hand**:

1. A black altar cloth, embroidered with silver sigils representing the Infernal Dominion, to be draped over a table or surface
2. Four black candles infused with the scent of brimstone
3. A ritual athame, a ceremonial knife used for ritualistic purposes only
4. A brass incense burner, filled with a blend of myrrh, wormwood, and asafoetida, all linked to the darker aspects of the spiritual world
5. A vial of freshly drawn blood, preferably from a donor who willingly offers it (this serves as a link between the practitioner and the protection ritual to be performed)
6. A parchment inscribed with an invocation in the language of the Void, written in red ink (the invocation calls upon the Dark Lord and his minions to serve as protectors)
**Step 2**: Creating the Sacred Space
Begin by lighting the four black candles, placing one at each cardinal point of your ritual space (North, South, East, and West). This acts as a shield against malevolent entities seeking entry. Once the candles are lit, start the incense burner, filling the air with its sinister aroma.
**Step 3**: Casting the Circle
With the ritual athame, draw a circle of protection around your working area, envisioning a dark energy emanating from the blade which creates a barrier between the physical and spiritual realms. **As you do this, chant the following incantation three times**:

"In nomine Diaboli, Omniumque Servitorum Infernalis,
Constituo hanc arcam arcanum potentiae meae,
Adversus entitates malignas, ego meipsum protegam,
Nunc et in aeternum. So mote it be."
**Step 4**: Invocation of the Dark Lord
Hold the parchment with the invocation to the Dark Lord. Recite the ancient language of the Void, allowing the words to fill the ritual space with power. This act serves as a request to the Dark Lord for protection. After reciting the invocation, burn the parchment with the flame of one of the black candles.
**Step 5**: Sealing the Pact
Once the invocation is complete, mix a few drops of the donor's blood with the ashes of the parchment to create a potent concoction. Using this mixture, anoint the candles, ritual athame, and yourself, primarily focusing on your forehead (third eye) and heart chakra.
**Step 6**: Closing the Circle
Once the pact is sealed, visualize the barrier of protection solidifying around you. When you are confident in the protective energies, proceed to extinguish the black candles in a counter-clockwise manner, starting from the West and moving through the cardinal points.

Store the ritual athame and remnants of the parchment and blood mixture in a safe place, for they now act as potent protective talismans against malevolent forces.

The protection ritual is now complete. The barrier shall remain until the same ritual is performed again, with the intention of breaking the protective bonds.
