Step-by-Step Ritual:

1. **Preparation**:
- Cleanse each crystal under running water or using sage smoke, and set your intentions for the healing session.
- Create a sacred, comfortable space for the individual being treated.

2. **Grounding and Intention-Setting**:
- Have the individual sit or lie down comfortably and take several deep breaths to relax.
- Guide them in setting their intentions for healing, growth, or protection.

3. **Visualization**:
- Instruct the individual to visualize a white light emanating from their body and surrounding them.

4. **Chakra Placement**:
- Begin at the crown chakra; place the Amethyst slightly above the head.
- Place the Clear Quartz on the individual's forehead (third eye chakra).
- Lay the Rose Quartz on their chest (heart chakra).
- Position the Black Tourmaline near the base of the spine (root chakra).
- Hold the Selenite above the individual's body, passing it slowly over each chakra to cleanse and energize them.

5. **Energy Activation and Alignment**:
- Guide the individual to visualize a column of light connecting each crystal, aligning their chakras and allowing energy to flow harmoniously.

6. **Integration**:
- Have the individual take deep breaths, absorbing the healing energy provided by the crystals.
- Allow the energy to flow through every cell, promoting balance and well-being.

Ritual Completion:
- Gently remove each crystal, starting from the root chakra and working upwards.
