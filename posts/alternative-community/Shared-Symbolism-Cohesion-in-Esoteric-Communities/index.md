B. The shared understanding of symbology and the use of a consistent set of symbols for communication and ritualistic practices.

The reason behind choosing this answer lies in the importance of shared understanding and consistent communication within occult and esoteric alternative communities. These groups center around the study and practice of various esoteric disciplines, and symbology plays a crucial role in these traditions. By using a consistent set of symbols, members can effectively communicate and express their ideas, beliefs, and practices, thereby fostering cohesion and growth among the group.

Symbology is not only essential for communication, but it also serves an important purpose in ritualistic practices. A wide range of esoteric and occult traditions has specific symbols & signs associated with them. These symbols act as focal points for the practitioners' intentions and beliefs. In this sense, a consistent use of symbols enables group members to unify their energies and work towards a common goal during their rituals.

The other choices, while potentially relevant, are not as universally significant to the development and cohesion of occult and esoteric communities. For instance, planetary alignments (A) might influence certain individuals and traditions but are not as far-reaching in their impact on the overall community. Similarly, the presence of opposing energies or forces (C) might challenge individual members within specific traditions but are not as integral to the community's cohesiveness and development as a whole. Lastly, while the frequency of gatherings (D) plays a role in maintaining group harmony and focus, it is the substance of the interactions - including a shared understanding of symbology - that contributes more significantly to the group's cohesion.

In conclusion, the shared understanding of symbology and the consistent use of symbols for communication and ritual practices are crucial for the development and cohesion of occult and esoteric alternative communities. By using a common set of symbols, members can effectively convey ideas, beliefs, and practices, which helps them build stronger connections, maintain group harmony, and promote their collective growth.
