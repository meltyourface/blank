## I. The Ephemeral Essence of Air

Within the welkin, whispers wove and sway'd,
Where seraphs flit 'pon wings of argent sheen,
They danced with zephyrs in an ether'd shade,
And murmur'd secrets, hidden and unseen;
Their tongues of glist'ning wisps in twilight sing,
Of realms untouch'd, of clouds where angels play.

Behold the tympanum of deep cerule,
Inscrib'd with glyphs of silver'd vap'rous breath,
A parchment trac'd in filigree of hue,
And bound within the firmament's frothy wreath;
Upon these sigils, ancient knowledge delve,
In sacred runes of gusty, airy spells.

Of breath and spirit etch'd in æther-light,
Their voices weave a web of phantom thread,
An unseen tapestry of endless flight
Convey'd from heights where mortal feet ne'er tread;
Awaken'd in the ever-living breeze,
In gusts, these airy songs do never cease.

Embrace this substance of intangible gleam,
In gossamer strands these arcane secrets thread,
The whispers of the stars mystics shall glean,
Upon feather'd wings ethereal knowledge spread;
Inhale the lib'rant elixir of life,
Exalted by the breath of air and sky.


### II. The Primeval Depths of Water

From thaumaturge' steed, the deluge trac'd,
A torrent of abyssal essence deep
Drowned fathomless cavern, catacombs chas'd
Where sombre currants ancient secrets keep,
As Styging wat'rs round sepulchers crease
Birth primordial depths in solace weave.

To plumb mystix'd chasms and seek the pearl
Occult in mirrors of argent sapphire,
A baptismal sea of brooks that swirl
Confined 'bate Moon's laden, lunar fire
Reflection cast and divination's wave
Forbidding Secrets break the surface grave.

Upon the cresting tide of foam and brine,
In saline balm of arcane wisdom drenched
The mystic wand'ring silver serpents' shrine,
Their fangs of nacre wisdom's nectars clenched;
This undulating river 'neath stars gleam,
In moonlit tides the lord of sleep shall dream.

O dread Leviathan, divulge thy ken;
Abrade the sand and find the hidden stream,
Surmise the depths that slumber 'neath our realm,
Submerge the blood in sunken vortex scheme;
'Til wisdom floods the conscious mind, immerse
Embrace the liquid dreamscape, free verse cursed.


### III. The Eternal Blaze of Fire

Inflamed and forged in primal heart of flame,
Fires immaterial by arcane hand,
The ravenous pyres do scorch the shadows tame,
Where fi’ry helixes entwine and dance;
Their tongues of ardent gold in passion sing,
Of razing flame and embers burning blaze.

Implode the dormant tinder, call the fire,
The spark in secret kept by Vulcan's grasp,
His smithy licks the night in burning pyre,
The crucible of secrets glist’ning gasp;
Awaken roots of magma 'neath our feet,
In tongues of sorcery do serpents meet.

A phoenix born from solitude of ash,
In incandescent fervor they confide,
The sonnets of eternal fire burn'd brash;
Ablaze, the rising embers ignite and glide;
Bound midst flame, the secrets freely spoke,
The victor be'in revealed through smoke.

Vomited forth in roil of dragons ire,
Consuming lies with veracity's fast,
Transmuted through the crucible of fire,
The raw untamed, by artist's sleight lix fix'd;
In spell of fervent yearning, ascend
Toward celestial flame, transmuting end.
