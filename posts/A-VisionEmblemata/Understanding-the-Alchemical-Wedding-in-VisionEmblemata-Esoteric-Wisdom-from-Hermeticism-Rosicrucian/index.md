The knowledge challenge at hand aims to explore the multifaceted layers of a VisionEmblemata with a focus on the Alchemical Wedding and unravel the esoteric teachings by examining the interconnected symbolism. To understand this complex and mystifying concept, we must draw upon the Hermetic and Rosicrucian traditions and attempt to reconcile their parallel themes to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the Magnum Opus' transformative process.

Firstly, let's explore the foundations of Hermetic and Rosicrucian traditions. Hermeticism is a philosophical and esoteric tradition based on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, an amalgamation of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. The core teachings of Hermeticism focus on the unity of the universe, the correspondence between the microcosm and the macrocosm, and the process of spiritual transformation.

The Rosicrucian tradition, on the other hand, is a spiritual and cultural movement that originated in Europe during the early 17th century. The teachings of Rosicrucianism emphasize the development of wisdom, spiritual alchemy, and enlightenment through a careful study of nature, art, and science. The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception reveals the hidden mysteries of nature and the framework for individual and collective evolution. 

Now that we have laid the groundwork, let's delve into the VisionEmblemata. The Alchemical Wedding is an emblematic example that connects the two traditions through its rich, symbolic archetypes. The Alchemical Wedding combines various symbols, such as the Red King and the White Queen, which represent the masculine and feminine principles – sulfur and mercury – necessary for the Magnum Opus, the grand achievement of spiritual alchemy.

The symbolic union of these principles signifies the formation of the 'Rebis' or 'Divine Hermaphrodite’ resulting from the Coniunctio, the divine marriage between the opposites. Alongside this symbolic union, the transformative journey is depicted through the interplay of alchemical colors (black, white, yellow, and red), where each shade represents a different stage in the Great Work of personal and cosmic transformation.

The correspondence between the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the universe) serves as an essential concept in Hermeticism and is exemplified in the Alchemical Wedding. The process of spiritual transformation corresponds to the progression of alchemical stages, which involve the purification of the soul and the unification with the divine. The Magnum Opus, then, mirrors the spiritual journey of an individual in unison with the transformation of the cosmos.

By unifying the teachings of Hermeticism and Rosicrucianism, we gain a wealth of esoteric wisdom and a deeper understanding of the VisionEmblemata. The Alchemical Wedding is a powerful symbol that encapsulates the transformative process of personal and spiritual evolution. It is through the union of opposites, the fusion of the microcosm and the macrocosm, and the harmonious integration of the alchemical colors that we come to embody the divine wisdom of the Hermetic and Rosicrucian traditions.

In summary, the Alchemical Wedding within the context of a VisionEmblemata sheds light on the interconnected symbolism and esoteric teaching that draw upon the Hermetic and Rosicrucian traditions. Uncovering the hidden meanings and wisdom encoded within the emblematics, one can attain a profound understanding of the spiritual and transformative aspects of the Magnum Opus. By harmonizing the parallel themes and concepts within these historical traditions, we gain invaluable insights into personal and cosmic evolution - the ultimate purpose of spiritual alchemy.
