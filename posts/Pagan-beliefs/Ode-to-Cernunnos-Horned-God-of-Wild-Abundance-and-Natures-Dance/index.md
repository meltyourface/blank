Ode to Cernunnos, the Horned God of Wild Abundance

In verdant groves where shadows dance,
I look for thee, Lord of the Wild,
Cernunnos, God of Nature's trance,
Thine ancient path 'fore us, beguiled.

Majestic stag and lordly beast,
With serpents' wisdom 'round thy waist,
Thou keeper of the earth's release,
Thy sacred cycle never to waste.

The hunter and the hunted blend,
In endless dance of life and death,
We seek thy counsel, ancient friend,
Our voices joined in solemn breath.

The darkest woods beneath the moon,
Are bidden by thy cloven feet,
The serpent wise, thine ever rune,
A guiding force in shadows meet.

With antlers grand and silv'ry mane,
We walk amid the dying leaves,
Anew shall sprout in gentle rain,
Thy grace of harvest thus achieved.

O Horned God of verdant green,
Great Cernunnos with shining gaze,
In woodland groves be ever seen,
Thine autumn's breath our hearts ablaze.

Lend us your strength and guidance pure,
Embrace our spirits, deep within,
With nature's song and roots to endure,
Let us remain forever kin.

Protect the wild, both beast and land,
O Cernunnos, thy realm inspire,
In Earth's sacred dance, we shall stand,
Entwined with seasons' never-tire.

Thus with this ode, your presence bound,
Conjure life where death awaits,
O Horned God of the fertile ground,
Cernunnos, in thee we dedicate.

May our bond with nature grow,
As antlers reach toward ceaseless skies,
In reverence to your mighty glow,
O Cernunnos, our spirits rise.
