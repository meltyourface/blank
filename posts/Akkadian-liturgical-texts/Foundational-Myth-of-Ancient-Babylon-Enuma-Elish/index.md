Answer: The Enuma Elish served as a foundational myth, strengthening the role and authority of Babylonian deities in religious ceremonies.

**Explanation**: The Enuma Elish, also known as the Babylonian Epic of Creation, is one of the most significant texts in the context of Akkadian liturgical literature. It is a foundational myth that serves to reinforce the Babylonian religious beliefs and the importance of their deities in religious practices of the time.

This epic primarily revolves around the story of the creation of the world and the gods, and the rise of Marduk, the chief deity of Babylon, to the position of supreme authority among all other gods. The Enuma Elish was not merely a cultural narrative but was deeply embedded in the religious ceremonies of the time. It provided a context for the establishment and consolidation of the authority of the Babylonian pantheon, particularly Marduk, and the legitimacy of the Babylonian rulers, who were considered to be the human representatives of the gods.

The epic was recited during religious festivals, most notably, during the New Year festival (Akitu) in Babylon. The Akitu festival was an important event in the Babylonian calendar, marked by processions, sacrifices, and the recitation of the Enuma Elish to reaffirm the authority of Marduk and the divine order he established. The prominence of the Enuma Elish in these ceremonies indicates its significance in shaping and reinforcing the religious beliefs and practices of ancient Babylon and its neighboring regions.

In contrast to the other options, the Enuma Elish is not primarily an economic document or solely a political document. While it does have political implications due to its emphasis on the divine right of Babylonian rulers, it is deeply rooted in religious practices and the worship of the Babylonian deities. The epic also does not discredit the importance of deities or discourage religious rituals; on the contrary, it bolsters their importance in the Babylonian religious system.

In summary, the Enuma Elish served as a foundational myth that strengthened the role and authority of Babylonian deities in religious ceremonies. Its close association with significant festivals and rituals highlights its importance in shaping the religious practices of the time.
