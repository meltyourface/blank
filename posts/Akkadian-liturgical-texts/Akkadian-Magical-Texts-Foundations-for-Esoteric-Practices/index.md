## Akkadian Liturgical Texts in Occult Studies

Introduction

Akkadian liturgical texts hold a central position in the study of the occult, providing insight into the beliefs and practices of the ancient Mesopotamian civilization primarily between 3rd to 1st millennium BCE. These texts include religious hymns, prayers, incantations, and rituals and offer valuable knowledge on the supernatural beliefs and the spiritual dimensions prevalent in ancient Akkadian society. By studying these sacred texts, students can gain a deeper understanding of esoteric practices, rituals, and the magical worldview from which they originated.

Key Texts and Usage

1. Enûma Eliš - The Babylonian Creation Myth: This foundational text outlines the story of the creation of the universe, the divine hierarchy, and the establishment of Babylon as the center of creation. By understanding the relationships between gods and their roles in creation, students can form a foundation for exploring the various divine aspects and their correspondences in later occult practices.

2. The Maqlû Series - Magical Rituals Against Witchcraft: The Maqlû Series is an extensive collection of anti-witchcraft incantations, with instructions to perform complex rituals to protect both individuals and the kingdom from ill-intentioned sorcery. These incantations showcase the power of spoken and written words in ancient Akkadian magical practices and can be adapted for modern use by students seeking protection from malicious energies.

3. Shurpu - The Magical Purification Series: Comprising rituals and incantations for purification and expiation, Shurpu provides insight into cleansing oneself of sin and divine anger. These texts offer guidance on uncovering and remedying spiritual impurities, which can be essential for students working with energies and entities in their esoteric practices.

Cultural and Historical Context

The Akkadian Empire was one of the first great empires in human history, spanning from modern-day Iraq to parts of Iran, Syria, and Turkey. The civilization's profound influence is reflected in the longevity of its religious and magical practices. Many ancient concepts from Akkadian liturgical texts have been incorporated into later esoteric traditions, including Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Thelema.

Notably, the Akkadian use of cuneiform writing allowed for widespread dissemination and preservation of their texts. This emphasis on the power of written language led to elaborate rituals in which words, symbols, and their arrangement played a crucial role. The underlying principles of these magical practices remain relevant today, providing students with a basis for understanding how language and symbolism function in modern esoteric practices.

Practical Applications

By examining these Akkadian texts, students can draw invaluable insights and apply them to modern esoteric practices. Several key applications include:

1. Invocation and Evocation: Learning the methods of respectfully invoking deities and spirits in ritual work, using hymns and prayers from ancient Akkadian traditions.

2. Astral Temple Work: By studying the sacred temple designs and role allocations, students can construct their ritual spaces and better understand the presence of gods in their magical work.

3. Utilizing Divine Names and Sigils: Unlocking the power of written language and symbolism, as seen in the Akkadian texts, by applying divine correspondences in spells and talismans.

4. Purification and Protection Techniques: Adapting the methods from the Maqlû and Shurpu series to protect students' spaces, energies, and ward off malevolent forces.

Conclusion

The significance of Akkadian liturgical texts in occult studies cannot be understated, as they present a wealth of information on the origins of esoteric beliefs and practices. By understanding these ancient texts, students can broaden their knowledge, grasp the historical context, and apply this wisdom to enhance their modern magical practices.
