Throughout Akkadian liturgical texts, Asakku demons represent a malignant force that pervades the natural and supernatural world, seeking to cause strife, illness, and misfortune. A central theme in ancient Mesopotamian exorcism rituals is the struggle between the exorcist, acting on behalf of divine and human order, and the demonic forces of chaos. This analysis will focus on the various manifestations and symbolic representations of Asakku demons and the techniques employed by exorcists to combat them, drawing from primary textual sources, such as the Maqlû series, Utukkū Lemnūtu, and Šurpu.

The Maqlû series, a collection of incantations and ritual texts, directly addresses Asakku and the forces they control. The word "maqlû" means "burning," which is indicative of the fiery nature employed in these rituals to combat the chaotic Asakku. Exploring the text, one can discern that the maqlû ritual is organized into several stages, such as purification, nocturnal incantations, and final victory through the symbolic burning of the demonic effigy. In this ritual, Asakku are depicted as serpentine creatures or as demonic birds, symbolizing their insidious nature and mobility to infect various aspects of human life.

The ancient Mesopotamian lexicon, Utukkū Lemnūtu, details the list of 11 wicked Utukkū (demons) that Asakku belong to, the seventh being Asag which is a direct cognate to Asakku. In the text, Asakku demons are portrayed as agents causing chaos and embodying natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes. Incantations and ritual enactments within Utukkū Lemnūtu seek to harness divine powers, often invoking the authority of gods like Marduk, to locate, bind, and eliminate the Asakku's malicious influence.

Šurpu, a series of purification rituals and incantations, further confirms the malign nature of Asakku through exorcism practices that involve identifying and destroying objects that house these demons. In various incantations, practitioners petition divine assistance to drive out the demons and re-establish harmony and stability. This series highlights the use of sacred objects, such as water, clay, and certain plants, to ward off Asakku and their baneful effects.

The battle between exorcists and Asakku demons mirrors the theological struggle between order and chaos that is central to ancient Mesopotamian cosmology. Gods, associated with justice and order, are often invoked as part of incantations and rituals. This divine intervention emphasizes the cosmic significance of individual exorcism battles as they symbolize the defense of the natural order against the onslaught of chaos.

In conclusion, Akkadian liturgical texts offer a rich documentation of the struggle against Asakku demons, their manifestations, and the ritual practices designed to combat them. The Maqlû series, Utukkū Lemnūtu, and Šurpu provide insight into the diverse representations of Asakku and the range of techniques employed in ancient Mesopotamian exorcism rituals. In turn, these texts reveal the pivotal role of exorcism in maintaining cosmic balance and defending the established order against the chaotic threat embodied by the malignant Asakku demons.
