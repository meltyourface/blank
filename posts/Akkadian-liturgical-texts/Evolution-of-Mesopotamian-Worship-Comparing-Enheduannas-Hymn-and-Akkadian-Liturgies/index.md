In answering this knowledge challenge, we will first explore the background of Enheduanna's Exaltation of Inanna and the Akkadian liturgical texts, and then delve into their linguistic devices and theological concepts. Following this, we will examine the evolution of Mesopotamian society and discuss how this transition reflects cultural, religious, and political changes.

Enheduanna's Exaltation of Inanna, also known as the Sumerian Hymn to Inanna, is one of the most notable works of ancient Sumerian literature. Written by Enheduanna, a high priestess and daughter of Sargon the Great, the work is primarily a hymn praising Inanna, the goddess of love, fertility, and warfare. The text is often regarded as an archetype of the genre of praise poetry and was composed during the Sumerian period in the third millennium BCE.

The Akkadian liturgical texts, on the other hand, are a collection of religious works written in the Akkadian language during the second millennium BCE. These texts contain prayers for divine intervention and protection, as well as guidance on how to perform various rituals and rites. Akkadian texts were generally more focused on personal relationships with deities, as opposed to the Sumerian texts' emphasis on community-driven worship.

When comparing the linguistic devices of Enheduanna's Exaltation of Inanna and the Akkadian liturgical texts, we can observe both similarities and differences. Both texts employ parallelism, repetition, and alliteration to emphasize and reinforce the divine attributes of the deities involved. Additionally, the use of metaphor and simile is prevalent in both texts, often serving to link the divine to natural phenomena, thereby showing their power and influence over the natural world. However, the Exaltation of Inanna exhibits characteristics of Sumerian literature, with a highly structured and formalized language, while the Akkadian liturgical texts are more conversational and fluid, reflecting the evolving cultural exchange between the different Mesopotamian societies.

Theologically, both the Exaltation of Inanna and the Akkadian prayers share the central idea of divine intervention and the intimate connection between deities and humans. In the Exaltation of Inanna, Enheduanna directly invokes Inanna's power and influence over worldly affairs, begging for her favor and support. Similarly, the Akkadian texts frequently call upon various gods and goddesses to provide assistance, guidance, and protection.

Despite these similarities, there are some significant differences in the theological concepts of the two sets of texts. In Enheduanna's work, Inanna is depicted as a singularly powerful deity, encompassing both destructive and creative forces. The Akkadian texts, by comparison, tend to portray a more diverse pantheon, with multiple deities holding power and influence over different aspects of life. This shift in theological focus reflects the broader cultural and religious changes in Mesopotamia as the region transitioned between the Sumerian and Akkadian periods.

The transition between Enheduanna's Exaltation of Inanna and the Akkadian liturgical texts exemplifies the cultural, religious, and political evolution of Mesopotamian society. As the ruling dynasties changed and the political landscape shifted, so did the religious practices and pantheon of deities. The transition from the Sumerian period to the later Akkadian era saw the blending of different religious beliefs and cultural practices, resulting in a fusion of the pantheons and greater emphasis on personal relationships with gods.

In conclusion, Enheduanna's Exaltation of Inanna and the Akkadian liturgical texts share similar linguistic devices and some theological concepts, such as divine intervention and a close connection between deities and humanity. However, significant differences in language structure and the diversity of deities illustrate the broader cultural and religious shifts that occurred in Mesopotamia during this time. The changing landscape of divine worship and literature mirrored the evolving cultural, religious, and political aspects of Mesopotamian society.
