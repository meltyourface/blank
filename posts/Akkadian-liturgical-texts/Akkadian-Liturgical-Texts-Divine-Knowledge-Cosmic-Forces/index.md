Answer: Akkadian liturgical texts contain complex systems of divine knowledge, which interweave Sumerian and Babylonian religious practices with the understanding of cosmic forces.

**Explanation**: The Akkadian liturgical texts, dating from the late third millennium BCE to the first millennium BCE, can be regarded as repositories of an intricate system of divine knowledge that relate to both religious practices and the understanding of the cosmos. These texts are not merely a random assortment of incantations or spells, but instead, contain a purposeful structure that combines elements of Sumerian and Babylonian religious practices with an exploration of cosmic and metaphysical forces.

The Akkadians were heavily influenced by the earlier Sumerian civilization, and they adopted and modified many of its religious and cultural elements, including the Sumerian pantheon of gods, religious rituals, and various literary genres. The Akkadian liturgical texts reflect a syncretic approach to cultic practice, incorporating and adapting multiple strands of religious thought.

The esoteric and occult aspects of these texts are closely tied to their attempts to convey divine knowledge. This includes intricate and nuanced descriptions of the relationships between various gods, their attributes, and powers, as well as the cosmic forces that govern the universe. The texts often employ symbolic language, numerology, and other encrypted modes of communication, in order to convey hidden meanings and secret truths, which were generally only accessible to trained priests or initiated occult practitioners.

It is important to recognize that Akkadian liturgical texts do not solely consist of hymns and prayers. While these are indeed an important component of the texts, there is an inherent, dynamic, and often subtle interplay between the worship of individual gods and the exploration of cosmic forces. Through this interconnected web of ideas, these texts reveal a complex and cohesive system of thought, which seeks to convey the mysteries of the divine and the cosmos to those who possess the knowledge, skill, and initiation required to unlock their secrets.
