The best answer: The use of divine authority to legitimize kingship in royal hymns.

In ancient Mesopotamia, the relationship between religion and politics was deeply intertwined, with religious beliefs and practices playing a central role in solidifying the power dynamics of the time. In this context, the use of divine authority to legitimize kingship in royal hymns demonstrates an important example of how religious practices were used to reinforce political power structures.

The Akkadian culture, which developed in ancient Mesopotamia around 2350 BCE, was marked by close interaction with the older Sumerian culture, which had a significant impact on the development of Akkadian religious practices, including liturgical texts. One significant aspect in which this interaction can be observed is in the practice of using divine authority to legitimize kingship in royal hymns.

These hymns were a key tool in establishing and maintaining the political status quo, as they not only asserted the king's divine right to rule but also served to draw a direct connection between the stability of the kingdom and the favor of its patron deities. By invoking the gods and portraying the king as their chosen representative on earth, royal hymns effectively served to reinforce the sacred nature of the king's authority and, by extension, the entire political hierarchy.

This practice is in line with the larger Mesopotamian belief system, which emphasized a close connection between the natural, human, and divine realms, with the king often being seen as a pivotal figure in maintaining order and balance in this system. Ultimately, this belief would have further supported the use of religious practices and rituals as a means of legitimizing and reinforcing political power structures.

The other options, while potentially relevant to specific aspects of Akkadian religious practices or moments in history, do not demonstrate the same level of interrelation between religious practices and political power dynamics:

- The exclusive focus on personal religious experiences in prayers and incantations is true to some extent, but these texts do not often delve into the political sphere and therefore do not offer a strong example of how religious practices and political power dynamics were interconnected in ancient Mesopotamia.
  
- The adoption of Sumerian liturgical elements in Akkadian texts as a means to assert cultural dominance may have played a part in the cultural exchange between the two societies. However, it cannot demonstrate a direct interrelation between religious practices and political power dynamics.
  
- The shift in deities' roles and attributes to reflect political alliances and changes in power structures is an interesting concept, but it focuses more on the adaptations in religious beliefs themselves rather than their direct use in reinforcing political power dynamics.
