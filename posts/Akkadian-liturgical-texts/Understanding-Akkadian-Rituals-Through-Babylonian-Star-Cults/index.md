Answer: Knowledge of Babylonian star cults and their celestial associations

**Explanation**: In the study of Akkadian liturgical texts, the knowledge of Babylonian star cults and their celestial associations is crucial to understanding the intended purpose, symbolism, and expected outcomes of these ancient rituals.

The Akkadian culture was heavily influenced by the Sumerians, with whom they shared many religious ideas and practices. However, one key distinctive aspect of the Akkadians was their strong connection to celestial bodies and their worship of the stars and planets. By understanding the Babylonian star cults and the associations they had with various deities and cosmic forces, one can better interpret the rituals and the intended outcomes within the Akkadian liturgical texts.

The Babylonians divided the sky into three sections, each ruled by a particular celestial god. Anu (the god of the heavens), Enlil (the god of the wind), and Ea (the god of the waters) ruled these divisions. The movements in their respective registrations were symbolic of their power and area of influence.

These celestial bodies were essential in divination, determining the right time of rituals, and linking the temporal events with astrological phenomena. The astral symbols were representative of the divine will, with Babylonian priests often interpreting the messages as the expectation of their gods.

Furthermore, the study of Babylonian star cults can reveal aspects of a culture's worldview, especially when examining the interconnectedness between the heavenly and earthly realms. These associations can provide insights into how the ancient rituals and practices ensured harmony and balance within their cosmology.

In comparison to other options:

1. Comparison with Sumerian religious texts and practices:
Though the Akkadians were heavily influenced by the Sumerians, the focus on celestial cults distinctly shaped the religious texts and rituals of the Akkadians. Studying only the Sumerian religious texts may not be sufficient to gain a detailed understanding of Akkadian liturgy.

2. Analysis of Akkadian administrative records dating from the same period:
While administrative records provide valuable context about the historical, political, and social settings, they may not offer the spiritual rationale and symbolism behind the liturgical texts in and of themselves.

3. Examination of Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions and their liturgical implications:
The Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions and their liturgical implications can provide additional context; however, they may not delve into the celestial associations central to the understanding of Akkadian liturgical texts and rituals.

In conclusion, an in-depth knowledge of Babylonian star cults and their celestial associations is crucial to understanding the purpose, symbolism, and expected outcomes of ancient Akkadian rituals within their liturgical texts. By examining these celestial links, researchers and scholars can build a comprehensive understanding of Akkadian beliefs, leading to further insights into the context and meanings underlying these ancient, sacred texts.
