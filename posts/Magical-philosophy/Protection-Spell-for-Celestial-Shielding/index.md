## Title: "Luminis Praesidium Caelum" (The Light of Sky's Protection)

Protection Spell:

Ingredients:
1. Aconitum lycoctonum (Wolf's Bane) - Provides protection from curses and negative energy
2. Salvia apiana (White Sage) - Cleanses and purifies the space, creating a sanctum for positive energy
3. Staurolite (Fairy Cross) - A rare mystical crystal known for its protective and grounding properties
4. Black Tourmaline - A powerful stone for absorbing and transmuting negative energy into positive energy
5. Selenite wand - Aids in channeling higher energies and enhances the metaphysical properties of associated stones and herbs
6. Ancient parchment - Symbolizes the knowledge and wisdom of the caster, serves as a canvas for the written incantation
7. Ink prepared from crushed Lapis Lazuli - Enhances the potency of the written incantation with the protective properties of Lapis Lazuli

Unique Incantation:

"Sidera meum ducem noctis,
Luceat et aperiatur,
Protégé meam seriem,
A malis fugietis,
Tenebris et hostibus,
Tu praesidium caelum lux."

Translation:

"Stars my guide in the night,
Shine and be revealed,
Protect my path,
From evils that flee,
Darkness and adversaries,
You are the light of the sky's shield."

Structure and Metaphysical Properties:

The spell begins by centering oneself and grounding their energy through the Staurolite's connection to the earth. By using the Selenite wand, the caster channels the energies of the celestial realm, connecting to the natural harmony of the universe.

The caster creates a protective circle using the crushed Aconitum lycoctonum and Salvia apiana mixture, forming the boundary that shall remain free of negative influence. The Fairy Cross, Black Tourmaline, and Lapis Lazuli ink are placed within this circle to empower and amplify the protective energies.

The incantation is inscribed on the ancient parchment using the Lapis Lazuli ink, imbuing the parchment with the metaphysical properties of the stone. Once finished, the parchment is placed in the center of the circle, surrounded by the stones.

Ultimate Astrological Alignment:

To maximize the effectiveness of the spell, proper astrological alignments should be considered. The most auspicious moment for casting "Luminis Praesidium Caelum" is during the Full Moon, particularly when the moon is in the house of Cancer, as it represents nurturing energy and protection.

The spell should be performed during an hour of Venus, as Venus traditionally signifies love, harmony, and peace. Additionally, planetary aspects such as trines (harmonious angles between planets) can also improve the potency of the protective energies.

Upon completing the ritual, the parchment serves as a talisman charged with the metaphysical properties of the ingredients and celestial energies, safeguarding the bearer from harm. The spell's potency stems from the synergistic interplay of the unique incantation, esoteric symbolism, and powerful intent of the caster.
