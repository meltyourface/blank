Riddle 1: The Searing Glyph
In the land of twisted shadows and velvet skies,
Where forgotten secrets and repressed sorrows reside,
A searing glyph doth rule the night,
Its fiery form guarding passage to an unholy rite.
Find me this symbol of infernal origin,
And mark it upon your flesh, the flame driving the sin.

[Symbol required: Sigil of the Infernal Flame]

Riddle 2: The Forbidden Anthology
In the depths of a tomb long condemned by men,
Lie decaying volumes that unleash the serpent's pen.
Bound by malice, their power obscure,
Seek the most ancient, the stories it'll conjure.
A name whispered in the darkness, barely heard,
Yet echoing malignantly through realms unobserved.

[Reference needed: Name of the dark entity from the Forbidden Anthology]

Riddle 3: The Unseen Chalice
Beyond the reach of mortal sight,
An unseen chalice holds an eldritch light.
A touch would doom the boldest of men,
But for one who bears the curse, only then,
Through trials and torment, the spirits guide,
Offer your essence, and drink the voided tide.

[Object quest: Acquire the Unseen Chalice, and offer one's blood]

Riddle 4: The Celestial Alignment
When moon conceals its face, and sorrow tugs the reign,
The stars align in patterns arcane.
A union desired, and yet so dire,
Shall the cosmic dance unlock the mire.
Steeped in knowledge of ancient gatherings,
Correctly calculate this celestial foreshadowing.

[Task: Determine the correct date from astrological clues]

Riddle 5: The Ebon Lullaby
In the midst of a cacophony of cries and wicked laughter,
Lies a tune of woe, buried within the ether.
The melody reaches those who dare to listen,
To its sorrowful call, a haunting premonition.
Repeat it thrice, let the syllables take flight,
And shatter the curse, the end of the night.

[Challenge: Compose the Ebon Lullaby from gathered fragments and perform it]

Completing these riddles and following their paths in sequence will lead the adept practitioner through the intricate process of unraveling the formidable and devastating curse. Only through mastery of the dark arts, perseverance, and cunning intellect can one hope to overcome the challenges presented and achieve the ultimate goal of lifting the curse.
