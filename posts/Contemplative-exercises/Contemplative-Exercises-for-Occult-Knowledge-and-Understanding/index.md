## Contemplative Exercises in the Occult

In this section, we explore three distinct contemplative exercises that have been used for centuries by students of the occult to gain knowledge and understanding. These exercises are designed to help practitioners expand their spiritual and mental capacity, allowing them to tap into the hidden reservoirs of energy and wisdom that reside within their psyche. We will discuss the historical origins of these techniques, their specific purposes within the occult realm, and step-by-step instructions on how to practice each exercise. Lastly, we will provide guidance on recognizing and measuring progress as practitioners deepen their understanding and mastery of these techniques.

1. **Hermetic Visualization**
Historical Origins: The Hermetic Tradition, originating in ancient Egypt and further developed during the Renaissance period, provides a powerful foundation for those wishing to develop higher levels of understanding in the occult. A central practice in this tradition is the art of visualization, which is used to connect with archetypal energies and unlock inner wisdom.

**Purpose**: Hermetic Visualization aims to establish a rapport between the practitioner and the living symbols of the spiritual realm. This connection can facilitate the flow of wisdom, power, and inspiration, empowering the practitioner to access deeper levels of knowledge.

**Practice**:
a. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you can sit or lie down without being disturbed.
b. Focus on a specific symbol, archetype, or deity, drawn from the rich tapestry of the Hermetic Tradition.
c. Begin to breathe deeply and evenly, entering a meditative state.
d. Visualize the symbol as clearly as possible, investing it with color, life, and vibrancy.
e. As you maintain this image, invite the presence of the archetype or deity to communicate with you, offering insight and guidance.
f. When you feel ready, gently bring the visualization to a close and return to ordinary consciousness.

2. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)
Historical Origins: Developed within the framework of the Golden Dawn, a late 19th-century esoteric order, the LBRP is a vital practice used for protection and purification.

**Purpose**: The LBRP serves to cleanse the practitioner's energetic field and the surrounding environment, creating a balanced and protective space in which the student can conduct further occult work.

**Practice**:
a. Stand upright, facing east, arms at your sides.
b. Perform the Qabalistic Cross, drawing energy from above, below, and the four cardinal directions to center and ground yourself.
c. Starting at your left hip, trace a pentagram in the air using your right hand, invoking the divine names in each cardinal direction (YHVH, Adonai, Eheieh, and AGLA).
d. Perform a clockwise circumambulation around the space.
e. Once again, perform the Qabalistic Cross to complete the ritual.

3. **Scrying**
Historical Origins: Scrying, or the art of looking into a reflective or translucent surface to receive messages and visions, has an ancient lineage and can be traced back to early shamanic practices.

**Purpose**: Scrying is a powerful tool for accessing hidden knowledge, unveiling what is concealed, and receiving intuitive guidance. It can also serve to develop the practitioner's clairvoyant abilities and enhance spiritual insight.

**Practice**:
a. Prepare a scrying tool, such as a crystal ball, mirror, or bowl of water.
b. Dim the lights in your space and ensure that you are free from distractions.
c. Position yourself comfortably with your scrying tool at eye level.
d. Relax your gaze, allowing your focus to soften and your mind to remain open.
e. Take note of any images, symbols, or impressions that arise and interpret them within the appropriate context of your spiritual practice.

Measuring Progress:
As students progress in their practice of these contemplative exercises, several signs of growth may become evident. **These include**:

1. Greater ease in achieving deep meditative states.
2. Increased clarity and vividness in visualizations.
3. Expansion of intuitive and psychic abilities.
4. Enhanced connectivity with spiritual energies and archetypes.
5. A growing sense of balance, protection, and mastery in occult work.

Consistent practice is the key to gaining rich knowledge and understanding through these exercises. By incorporating these methods into their daily spiritual practice, students of the occult can develop greater control over their inner and outer worlds and tap into the realm of hidden wisdom and power.
