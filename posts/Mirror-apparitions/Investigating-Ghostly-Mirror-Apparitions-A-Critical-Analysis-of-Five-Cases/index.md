To investigate the credibility of diverse reported mirror apparition incidents, I have thoroughly examined historical documentation, eyewitness accounts, and paranormal research findings. I have taken into consideration various cultural, psychological, and environmental factors that may contribute to these occurrences and assessed the validity of five specific cases. These cases include the Myrtles Plantation mirror case, the Queen Mary mirror case, the Indian supernatural mirror in Rajasthan, the Countess Bathory case, and the French Revolution mirror case.

Case 1: Myrtles Plantation Mirror
The Myrtles Plantation in Louisiana, United States, is deemed as one of the most haunted places in America. The legend revolves around the ghost of Chloe, a slave who supposedly poisoned a family and now haunts the estate. The mirror in the plantation is said to be cursed, trapping the spirits of the victims. Eyewitness accounts and paranormal investigations report seeing handprints on the mirror and ghostly figures. However, the credibility of this case can be questioned due to inconsistencies in historical records, specifically regarding Chloe's existence.

Case 2: Queen Mary Mirror
The RMS Queen Mary, docked in Long Beach, California, is known for paranormal activity. Particularly, the first-class pool changing rooms are known for a mysterious haunted mirror. Many believe the mirror belonged to a woman who drowned in the pool. Eyewitness accounts report ghostly appearances and strange reflections. This case is challenging to authenticate due to the lack of corroborated historical documentation.

Case 3: Indian Supernatural Mirror in Rajasthan
In Rajasthan, India, there is a lesser-known case of a haunted mirror within the walls of an ancient fort. Local lore indicates that the spirit of a scorned princess haunts the mirror. The princess's image is said to appear in the mirror under certain lighting conditions and lunar phases. The cultural and historical context seems plausible, considering India's rich supernatural folklore. However, there is not enough solid evidence to firmly establish the authenticity of this case.

Case 4: Countess Bathory
Countess Elizabeth Bathory, a Hungarian noblewoman, was infamous for her alleged crimes of torturing and killing young girls in the late 16th century. According to the legends, she would examine her appearance in her chamber's mirror while her victims were being tortured. The mirror room in her castle is considered haunted by the souls of her victims. The mirror is said to reflect their faces and emit screams. Despite historical records supporting the existence of Countess Bathory and her crimes, there is no concrete evidence to verify the supernatural claims of the haunted mirror.

Case 5: French Revolution Mirror Case
During the French Revolution, many aristocrats were executed by guillotine. Legend has it that a mirror placed in front of the guillotine captured the faces of the victims as their heads dropped. As a result, the mirror now exhibits ghostly faces when illuminated at certain angles. While the historical context is accurate, the claims of supernatural phenomena associated with the mirror remain inconclusive and unsubstantiated.

**Conclusion**:
After thoroughly investigating these cases, it appears that while patterns of supernatural mirror phenomena exist in various cultures, the lack of solid evidence casts doubts on their credibility. Psychological and environmental factors, such as the power of suggestion and atmospheric conditions, can contribute to people perceiving supernatural or paranormal experiences. In conclusion, while ghostly mirror apparitions remain prevalent in folklore across the globe, the plausibility of supernatural mirror phenomena still requires more definitive evidence.
