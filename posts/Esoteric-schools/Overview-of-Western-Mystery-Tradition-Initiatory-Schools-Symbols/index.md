The Western Mystery Tradition is a complex system of esoteric teachings and practices, which has evolved over time and spread through various esoteric orders. While it is challenging to provide a comprehensive overview of all the initiatory stages due to the sheer vastness and interconnectivity of these orders, I will attempt to outline some of the key elements, symbols, rituals, and teachings as they relate to Esoteric schools.

1. Ancient Mystery Schools
The foundations of the Western Mystery Tradition can be traced back to the ancient Mystery Schools of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, where initiates would undergo a series of rites and rituals designed to awaken spiritual knowledge and understanding.

Key Symbols: The Ankh (Egyptian symbol of eternal life), Caduceus (representing divine balance and harmony), and the Delphic Oracle (symbol of the connection between the human and divine worlds).

Rituals and Teachings: Some of the key rituals in these ancient schools included purification ceremonies, sacred dances, and initiatory trials. The primary teaching focused on the idea that, through spiritual development, the individual could attain a direct experience of the divine and, ultimately, immortality.

2. Hermeticism and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
Derived from the ancient Egyptian-Greco-Roman wisdom, Hermeticism is one of the pillars of the Western Mystery Tradition. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was founded in the late 19th century and quickly became one of the most influential and well-known esoteric orders.

Key Symbols: The Rose Cross, the Tree of Life, and the Hexagram.

Rituals and Teachings: The initiatory stages within the Golden Dawn generally follow three grades known as the Outer Order, Second Order, and Third Order. These grades include a series of rituals and teachings designed to awaken spiritual understanding and mastery over esoteric workings, such as astral travel, divination, alchemy, and theurgy.

3. Rosicrucianism
Emerging in the early 17th century, the Rosicrucian movement sought to bring together elements of alchemy, occult philosophy, and mystical Christianity.

Key Symbols: The Rose and Cross, the Rosy Cross, and the Rosicrucian motto: "By this sign, thou shalt conquer" (INRI).

Rituals and Teachings: Rosicrucian initiatory stages involve a progressive study and mastery of various spiritual paths, including Qabalah, alchemy, and astrology. The overall goal of the initiate is to achieve a state of spiritual illumination and to understand the unity and interconnectedness of all things.

4. Freemasonry
One of the most well-known esoteric orders, Freemasonry is a fraternal organization that traces its roots to the guilds of medieval stonemasons. While not specifically a school of occult or esoteric study, it has significantly contributed to the development and dissemination of esoteric knowledge in the Western Mystery Tradition.

Key Symbols: The Square and Compasses, the All-Seeing Eye, and the Pillars of Jachin and Boaz.

Rituals and Teachings: The initiatory stages of Freemasonry consists of three primary degrees: Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason. These degrees involve a series of initiatory rituals, moral teachings, and symbolism designed to impart esoteric understanding.

In conclusion, the Western Mystery Tradition is a diverse and ever-evolving tapestry of esoteric teachings and practices, and while this overview provided only a brief analysis, the complexity and interconnectedness of these various orders remains a testament to the far-reaching influence and timeless wisdom found within the mysteries of the Esoteric schools.
