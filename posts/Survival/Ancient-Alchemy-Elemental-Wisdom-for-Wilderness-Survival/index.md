To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first establish an understanding of the ancient alchemical principles and the elemental correspondences of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Emerging in the Hellenistic period, alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that aimed to transform base metals into noble metals, through a process of purification and perfection of both the substances and the alchemist's own spirit. Central to this tradition was the concept of the four elements, which served as a framework for understanding the natural world and was heavily influenced by the works of ancient Greek philosophers.

In this context, the ancient elements are considered as follows:
1. **Earth**: This element represents solidity, stability, and support. It is associated with physical body, material resources, and groundedness.
2. **Air**: This element symbolizes motion, communication, and intellect. It is linked to mental processes, knowledge, and the power of the mind.
3. **Fire**: This element stands for energy, transformation, and passion. It represents life force, drive, and the indomitable spirit of the individual.
4. **Water**: This element signifies emotions, intuition, and cleansing. It is associated with feelings, psychic abilities, and spiritual connections.

Having established the foundational understanding of these elemental forces, we can now explore the ways in which an in-depth knowledge of these elements could enhance one's ability to survive and thrive in the wilderness.

1. **Earth**: Mastering the element of Earth allows an individual to understand the importance of conserving energy and establishing a secure foundation before undertaking an expedition. In a practical scenario, this could take the form of planning an appropriate route, creating a proper emergency shelter, and understanding how to locate and use available natural resources, such as food, water, and materials for fire-making.

2. **Air**: Harnessing the power of Air enables one to effectively communicate and stay informed, as well as adapt to changing conditions. In a wilderness context, this could involve understanding weather patterns and how they influence the environment, learning to effectively signal for help or navigate using natural markers, and developing the mental resilience needed to maintain perspective and make sound decisions in challenging situations.

3. **Fire**: A deep understanding of the Fire element provides insights into the transformative power of energy and the necessity of maintaining a strong inner drive. This would be useful in a survival scenario as it helps the individual understand the importance of keeping warm, cooking food, and producing light. Knowing how to create and sustain a fire using various methods and materials, as well as maintaining a self-motivated, goal-oriented mindset, would be integral to surviving and thriving in the wilderness.

4. **Water**: Grasping the essence of the Water element empowers one to cultivate emotional and intuitive intelligence. This could manifest in a practical wilderness survival situation through learning how to find and purify water sources, recognizing the importance of maintaining hydration, and embracing the adaptive qualities of water by staying flexible and adjusting to unpredictable circumstances.

To illustrate the interconnectedness of these lessons on elemental forces, consider the following practical scenario: 

An individual is stranded in a remote wilderness area, having lost their bearings after an unexpected storm. To survive and eventually make their way back to civilization, they must effectively engage with each of the four elements.

First, by drawing on their understanding of the Earth element, they create a secure shelter and locate nearby resources for nourishment and fire-making. Then, they apply the Air element by utilizing their mental resilience and observational skills to identify noticeable landmarks and to form an evacuation plan. Next, they employ the Fire element by kindling a fire using native materials and maintaining the drive to persevere in harsh conditions. Finally, the Water element serves them through the process of locating, collecting, and purifying water for consumption, as well as adapting their emotional state in the face of various obstacles.

In summary, a deep understanding of the ancient alchemical principles and the elemental correspondences of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water can significantly enhance one's ability to survive and thrive in the wilderness. Applying knowledge of these elements, drawing from their symbolism, and recognizing their interconnectedness prepares an individual to face and overcome the myriad of challenges that they might encounter in a wilderness setting.
