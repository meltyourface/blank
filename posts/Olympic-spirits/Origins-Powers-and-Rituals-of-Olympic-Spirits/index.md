## Title: The Olympic Spirits: Origins, Hierarchy, Associations, and Rituals

### I. Origins of the Olympic Spirits

The history of the Olympic Spirits traces back to the Renaissance when scholars started exploring various branches of esotericism. One of these focuses was the study of the Olympic Spirits, otherworldly beings believed to possess unparalleled knowledge and govern the cosmos. The existence of these spirits is first found in the manuscripts of the 'Arbatel of Magic', a seminal grimoire from the 16th century that encompasses various domains of life and the planetary rulers that govern them. The Olympic Spirits were considered guides to unlocking an adept's full potential and power in their pursuit of wisdom and understanding.

### II. Hierarchy of the Olympic Spirits

Within the Arbatel of Magic, there are mentions of seven Olympic Spirits, each derived from one of the classical planets in astrological tradition. These spirits are considered the governors of the astral plane and are directly linked to the ancient Greco-Roman gods. **The following is a list of the seven Olympic Spirits and their corresponding divine counterparts**:

1. Aratron - the Spirit of Saturn, associated with the god Chronos.
2. Bethor - the Spirit of Jupiter, linked to the god Zeus.
3. Phaleg - the Spirit of Mars, connected to the god Ares.
4. Och - the Spirit of the Sun, representing the god Apollo.
5. Hagith - the Spirit of Venus, associated with the goddess Aphrodite.
6. Ophiel - the Spirit of Mercury, linked to the god Hermes.
7. Phul - the Spirit of the Moon, connected to the goddess Artemis.

These beings hold immense power and wisdom across various realms, but summoning them requires utmost respect and adherence to rituals.

### III. Planetary Associations

Each Olympic Spirit is connected to a celestial body, which in turn is linked to specific energies, colors, symbols, and hours. Understanding these associations is paramount for summoning and working with the spirits efficiently and harmoniously. **The planetary correspondences for each spirit are as follows**:

1. Aratron - Governed by Saturn, related to stability, persistence, and discipline. Its energies are best channeled on Saturdays with dark hues like black and indigo as its colors.
2. Bethor - Under the influence of Jupiter, this spirit is closely connected to growth, abundance, and wisdom. Thursdays are considered the most auspicious days, with purple and blue as the corresponding colors.
3. Phaleg - Drawing power from Mars, Phaleg is the spirit of ambition, action, and dynamics. Due to its fiery nature, Tuesdays with colors like red and orange are deemed most fitting.
4. Och - Governing the energies of the Sun, this spirit is linked to healing, vitality, and illumination. Sundays are preferred for rituals involving Och, and its color associations include gold and yellow.
5. Hagith - Bound to Venus, this spirit embodies beauty, artistry, and love. Fridays serve as auspicious occasions to work with Hagith, and preferred colors include green and pink.
6. Ophiel - Mercury rules over Ophiel, the spirit of communication, intellect, and travel. The most suitable day to summon this spirit is Wednesday, with orange and yellow as its corresponding colors.
7. Phul - Drawn from the Moon, this spirit is associated with intuition, emotions, and the subconscious. Mondays are ideal, and silver and pale green are two complementary colors.

### IV. Summoning Rituals and Precautions

To successfully summon the Olympic Spirits and benefit from their wisdom, initiates must follow certain protocols and precautions:

1. **Choose an appropriate time**: Ensure that the specific planetary day and hour algin with your chosen spirit. This will allow their energy to be more receptive and conducive to your intentions.
2. **Create an appropriate space**: Set aside a clean, peaceful, and disturbance-free environment for the ritual. Illuminate the space using candles in the spirit's corresponding colors, and make use of their symbols, sigils, and planetary associations as adornments.
3. **Purification and protection**: Before starting, initiates should cleanse themselves via a ritual bath, meditation or visualization. Invoking a protective circle or calling upon their guardian spirits can also help in shielding them from negative energies.
4. **Meditation and intent**: Focus your mind on the spirit you wish to summon. Develop a clear intent and establish a respectful approach that emphasizes seeking their guidance and wisdom.
5. **Invocation**: Recite a specific invocation or prayer to the Olympic Spirit you wish to call upon. Speak with sincerity, clear intention, and respect. Keep an open and receptive mindset for receiving any messages, intuitions, or signs that might follow the invocation.
6. **Offering gratitude**: Once the ritual has reached its completion, express gratitude to the Olympic Spirit and bid them farewell respectfully. In doing so, you maintain a positive relationship with the spirit and honor their presence and assistance.

Working with the Olympic Spirits can lead to deep knowledge and understanding, as long as initiates enter the process with humility, respect, and adherence to the rules associated with these powerful entities. In doing so, they may find themselves unlocking the secrets of the cosmos and unleashing their true potential.
