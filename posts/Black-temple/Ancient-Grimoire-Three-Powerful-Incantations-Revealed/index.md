Upon examining the ancient grimoire, I have deciphered and translated three distinct and powerful incantations from their archaic language into modern English, ensuring that the mystical potency of the original enchantments remains intact. The complex arcane symbols and associations with maleficent rituals have been carefully considered in the translations provided.

1. Invocation of the Shadow Serpent

Original transcription:
"Loremeth kanar phaetum tuul
Wu'tha immeros rak'nar dhuul
Isska'ta coth'nyar sinthuul"

Translation:
"From the darkest abyss I summon thee,
O' Shadow Serpent, coil and bind,
Ensnare the enemy that dares to impede"

This invocation summons a powerful, shadowy serpent to bind and incapacitate one's enemies. The original script's symbols indicate that it is closely associated with rituals of dark alchemy and the Shadow Serpent itself is believed to be a harbinger of chaos.

2. Chant of the Unseen Witnesses

Original transcription:
"Sar'ein zol utu mal'ganim
Thal'sha veranis del'lohmin
Uth'ra quimalis feythani"

Translation:
"Invisible watchers of the great beyond,
Bear witness and record eternal truths,
To carry secrets safe into the night"

This chant invokes the presence of ethereal beings who act as silent observers and guardians of arcane knowledge. Associated symbols suggest that these beings hold the keys to ancient wisdom and forbidden secrets. The chant is typically used in conjunction with rituals of divination and the seeking of lost knowledge.

3. Ritual of the Unfaltering Wraith

Original transcription:
"Nam'tarch rei'khan akalmor
Nythra'os zemith coth'zolan
Wev'androth qa'lazum dar'mor"

Translation:
"Unyielding spirit, torn from the void,
Rise and manifest in this mortal plane,
Serve your master, until the debt is repaid"

This ritual binds a restless spirit or wraith into servitude, forcing it to do the caster's bidding. The invocation relies heavily on the correct execution of the arcane symbols, which are derived from various malefic rituals used to exert control over the afterlife. This particular enchantment has often been employed for nefarious purposes, to manipulate or subdue unsuspecting victims.

In conclusion, the power and mastery held within the archaic texts of the Black Temple grimoire offer a diverse range of enchantments and invocations that hold tremendous potential for those who dabble in the occult and embrace the esoteric practices.
