The symbol to decode is a cryptic sigil known as the "Abyssal Seal". A complex, multi-layered emblem, the Abyssal Seal is said to hold great power and significance within the Black Temple's ancient secrets. 

The Seal's geometry is intricate, consisting of a nine-pointed star -- a nonagon -- encased within three concentric circles. The nonagon's significance lies in its representation of both union and division, reflecting the balanced harmony of dark energies. Each of the nine vertices are inscribed with archaic runes, likely pulled from an ancient language or reality. The concentric circles symbolize dimensions of power and the layers of truth that lie hidden within the emblem.

The specific components of the design, including the nonagon's runes, play a crucial role in the dark energies and influences behind the Abyssal Seal. Examining the runes more closely, they seem to form an intricate web of connections to various ancient practices and otherworldly entities. It is believed that each rune represents one of the nine Dark Lords that once ruled the Abyss, and together they form a covenant focused on harnessing powerful energies and weaving them together.

The possible connections to ancient practices suggested by the sigil are manifold. The intricate interplay of the seal's elements suggests that it serves as a barometer of dark forces, the gatekeeper of the energies that simultaneously bind and divide. It is believed to have played a critical role in the execution of high-level rituals such as shadowmancy, blood magic, and demonic summoning. 

To better understand the Abyssal Seal and its function in the Black Temple's rituals, various methods of divination and cryptography were employed. Scrying and numerology pointed to the Seal's geometric connections, while deciphering ancient manuscripts provided crucial insight into contextual significance of the sigil. Through these practices it was deciphered that the Seal played a pivotal role in the unholy contract between the temple's congregation and the nine Dark Lords of the Abyss.

Upon further research and exploration, the true significance of the Abyssal Seal was unveiled. It didn't just hold power in its symbolism, but was, in fact, a key to unlocking vast knowledge and energies from the Abyss. Each rune functioned as an individual conduit, and when the nine-pointed star was properly activated, the energies would link together to form a bridge to the realm of the Dark Lords, granting unprecedented access to their power, and influence.

Ultimately, the Abyssal Seal stands as a testament to the ingenuity and determination of the Black Temple's congregation, who sought to tap into the fundamental forces of darkness. Engaging with such a potent symbol was a perilous endeavor, underscoring the congregation's relentless ambition and commitment to harnessing the full might of the Abyss.
