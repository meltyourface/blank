To address this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the core concepts: spiritual states of ecstasy found in various mystical traditions, ego dissolution, and the attainment of higher consciousness, transcendence, and manifestation of psychological archetypes associated with enlightenment. 

Spiritual states of ecstasy manifest in various mystical traditions such as Sufism, Hinduism, Kabbalah, Christian mysticism, and shamanic practices. They typically involve powerful emotions, altered states of consciousness, and intensely transcendent experiences, perceived as unification or communion with the divine or ultimate reality. These experiences challenge the boundaries of conventional reality and bring initiates closer to self-discovery, communion, and self-transcendence.

Ego dissolution refers to the experience of losing the sense of self or the distinction between self and other. This typically occurs during deep meditative practices, in mystical or peak experiences, and occasionally through the responsible use of psychedelics. The ego, a complex set of beliefs, desires, and thought patterns that construct our sense of self, temporarily dissolves, allowing for an experience of selflessness and unity with the surrounding environment, other beings, or even the entire universe.

Higher consciousness, transcendence, and the manifestation of psychological archetypes associated with enlightenment involve various manifestations of profound insight, personal growth, and transformation. Higher consciousness is a greater awareness of oneself, others, and the cosmos. Transcendence refers to going beyond one's ordinary existence and limitations, experiencing a greater reality or divine presence. Manifestation of psychological archetypes, such as archetypal symbols and experiences found in dreams and visions, contribute to the acquisition of knowledge and understanding necessary for enlightenment.

Now, let us analyze the connection between the spiritual states of ecstasy and ego dissolution in relation to higher consciousness, transcendence, and psychological archetype manifestation.

In reaching spiritual states of ecstasy, an individual often experiences ego dissolution as a direct effect. For instance, a Sufi whirling dervish enters a state of ecstasy where they let go of their ego identity, allowing themselves to merge with the divine and reach an altered state. Similarly, Indian yogis practice deep meditation to achieve 'Samadhi,' where they experience unification with the ultimate reality and dissolution of their ego identity.

The experience of unity resulting from ego dissolution makes way for a direct intuition of ultimate truth and higher consciousness. It opens initiates to spiritual dimensions beyond mundane concerns and enables them to perceive a much broader reality. By transcending everyday worries and desires, these individuals gain access to divine wisdom, which often involves psychological archetypes such as the Wise Old Man or The Mother, aiding in self-discovery and transformation.

Through these experiences, they also achieve transcendence, experiencing a sense of being freed from the material world's limitations and touching a larger, more profound level of existence. 

To sum up, the connection between spiritual states of ecstasy and ego dissolution in various mystical traditions is inherently interwoven. With the dissolution of ego, individuals become open to transcendent experiences and higher states of consciousness. Their encounters with psychological archetypes and the divine facilitate profound transformation and strengthen their connection to ultimate reality. The practice of rituals, meditation, and exploring sacred states of ecstasy leads seekers on a path towards self-discovery, enlightenment, and the comprehension of deeper truths about themselves and the universe.
