description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Ecstasy, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Craft a mesmerizing poetic ode, delicately weaving the themes and allegories of Ecstasy, dedicated to a specific elemental force or divine figure deeply rooted in your chosen mystical pantheon. Carefully incorporate historical beliefs and symbology, while also infusing your own creative interpretations to enhance the profundity of the ode's expression. Reflect on the transcendent connection between this force or deity and the realms of altered consciousness, the nature of divine rapture, and spiritual epiphanies. As you pen your mystic verses, expertly channel the essence of your chosen subject to evoke a profound sense of awe and admiration in your readers, embodying the intricate depths of the esoteric and occult realm of Ecstasy.

Ode to the Serpent of the Underworld: Nidhoggr

I sing the scales, both vile and vivid,
Of the great Nidhoggr, whose name is whispered,
In catacombs and shadowed chambers,
He whose coils bind the roots of Yggdrasil.

Serpent of the underworld, thou consuming maw,
Thy twisted form entwines the fates of gods and men.
Engulfed in rapture, we mortal souls inquire,
What wisdom does thy venom well inspire?

Seep noxious balm, preserved in golden chalice,
From whence dark consciousness, in splinters, spirals.
We draw our draughts, at once both grand and grim,
To glimpse the truth behind thine endless grin.

Solemn circles 'round ancient trees we tread,
Echoing the sacred runes of elder bones.
In mystic dances intertwined with fate,
We perform pantomimes governed by the cosmic spheres.

A spark divine, 'neath carmine moon doth dwindle,
Thy aura green-lit maggots cast their trails.
In reverence, Delphic eye perceives thine influence,
From Ragnarok and beyond, to the vast expanse.

Nidhoggr, eater of the dead, we request your gift,
A gasp within the writhing coils of serpentine embrace.
Enraptured, see our skins dissolve, to yield the truth,
As phoenixes from the ashes, eternal rebirth induced.

Ouroboros, the immortal cycle we discern,
As primal thirst is quenched and spirit fire burns.
Recall we now the Elder Edda's cryptic lines,
Foretelling time dissolved in quaking earth.

In tremors vast, Nidhoggr's coils do unwind,
Releasing brethren from the gory gallows' binds.
In celebration, singers 'round the world tree chant,
An ode to the serpent, whose ecstasy enchants.

In tribute to your power, Nidhoggr, we quaff,
Remembering the marvels of old, long kiss'd by dusk.
We raise our goblets high, and drink of mystic nectar,
In throes of ecstasy, eternal secrets to uncover.
