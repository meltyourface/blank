The answer is: Cultivating self-discipline, in-depth study, and spiritual growth.

The core principles of adept work within the occult emphasize the importance of personal development, in-depth study of esoteric knowledge, and fostering spiritual growth. These principles have been established in various esoteric traditions throughout history, including Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and the Western mystery schools. These traditions emphasize the importance of inner transformation, as well as the acquisition and application of esoteric knowledge in the pursuit of spiritual evolution and self-realization.

Cultivating self-discipline is a key aspect of this process, as it enables the practitioner to maintain focus and dedication to their spiritual growth. This includes developing mental and emotional strength, perseverance, and the ability to maintain ethical and compassionate behavior.

In-depth study is essential for understanding the complexities of the esoteric path and the profound spiritual dimensions it encompasses. This requires a commitment to learning about various esoteric disciplines, techniques, and approaches, as well as exploring texts and teachings from diverse times and cultures. It is through this scholarly pursuit that the practitioner can gain access to hidden or concealed knowledge and develop a well-rounded understanding of the occult.

Spiritual growth is the ultimate goal of the esoteric path, and it involves the conscious transformation and evolution of the individual on multiple levels â€“ mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. This growth leads to the realization of one's inherent divinity and their connection to the greater universal truth. It is through this self-realization that adepts can ultimately gain a greater understanding of their place in the cosmos and their purpose in life.

The other options presented in the question do not reflect the true essence of esoteric practices and the path of the adept. Relying solely on intuition is not sufficient, as adepts should be able to substantiate and complement their intuitive knowledge with structured practices and in-depth study to ensure a strong foundation.

Focusing only on knowledge acquisition without considering ethics fails at recognizing the spiritual component inherent in esoteric practices. Cultivating wisdom and understanding should be aligned with ethical and spiritually uplifting actions; otherwise, it can lead to misuse or manipulation of esoteric knowledge.

Lastly, focusing on attaining power and influence over others goes against the inherent principles of spiritual growth and self-realization. True adepts do not seek power for selfish reasons, but instead, their development is oriented towards benefiting others and contributing to the greater good, guided by compassion and understanding.

In conclusion, the core principles of adept work within the occult involve the cultivation of self-discipline, in-depth study, and spiritual growth. This approach helps the practitioner to embark on their journey with a solid foundation, while aligning their actions and intentions with the higher spiritual values of compassion, wisdom, and self-realization.
