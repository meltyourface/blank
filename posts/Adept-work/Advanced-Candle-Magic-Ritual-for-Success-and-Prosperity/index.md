To conduct an advanced candle magic ritual, follow these steps:

1. **Determine your desired outcome**: For this example, let's manifest success in a new business venture.

2. **Select the appropriate candle color**: For success and prosperity, the ideal candle color would be green.

3. **Planetary associations**: Connect to the energy of Jupiter, the planet associated with growth, expansion, and success.

4. **Create the beeswax candle**: Hand-craft a green beeswax candle, taking care to imbue it with essential oils that align with the intention. In this case, these oils could include basil, cinnamon, and bergamot.

5. **Sigil crafting**: Draw or carve a sigil representing your desired outcome into the candle. This could be a symbol of abundance, growth, or a unique glyph that encapsulates the purpose of the spell.

6. **Timing the ritual**: Schedule the ritual according to the lunar cycle, ideally during a waxing moon, which symbolizes growth and expansion. Also, select a day that aligns with Jupiter's energy, such as Thursday.

7. **Astrological considerations**: Choose a time when Jupiter is in a favorable position in your natal chart or when there are supportive aspects to Jupiter in the sky. Ideally, try to conduct the ritual during a Jupiter Hour to enhance the power of the working further.

8. **Altar arrangement**: Arrange an elaborate altar with items that resonate with the energy of your intention. This could include crystals such as citrine, aventurine, or pyrite; herbs like basil, sage, or bay leaves; and symbols or images of abundance, growth, or anything relevant to your business venture.

9. **Ritual enactment**: Light the candle, visualize your desired outcome, and recite an incantation, prayer, or affirmation of your intention. Speak this out loud, emanating your energy and conviction. You may also choose to hold the relevant crystals, focus on the sigil, or contemplate the herbs as you recite your intention.

10. **Ritual closing**: Once the ritual is complete, allow the candle to burn down and extinguish itself or snuff it out. Dispose of any remaining materials in a way that honors the intention—perhaps burying them in your garden to symbolize growth, or placing them in a special pouch to carry with you as a reminder of your goal.

By integrating all of these elements—color symbolism, planetary associations, essential oils, sigil crafting, lunar and astrological timing, and altar construction—you will successfully conduct an advanced candle magic ritual that manifests the desired outcome.
