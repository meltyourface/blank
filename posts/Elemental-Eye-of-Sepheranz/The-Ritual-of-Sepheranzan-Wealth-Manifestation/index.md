## The Sepheranzan Ritual of Elemental Wealth

Purpose: To manifest an influx of material wealth and opulence through the utilization of the six elemental powers.

Ritual Preparation:
1. Cleanse and purify the ritual space of any negative energies.
2. Arrange an altar to display the six corresponding gemstones and sigils associated with each elemental force.
3. Anoint the forehead of both the novice and adept with oil infused with the energy of the Elemental Eye of Sepheranz.

### Part One: Invoking the Elemental Powers

1. The adept initiates the ceremony by lighting a central ceremonial fire to represent the element of fire, using sacred wood and herbs. The novice attends and observes the technique.

2. Both the novice and adept hold hands, entering a state of deep concentration, and meditate on the Elemental Eye of Sepheranz.

3. They begin reciting the incantation of fire:

 "Searing flame, burning high,
 Merge with Sepheranz's Eye.
 Wealth from fiery passions birth,
 Elements converge to grant us worth."

4. The adept pours water from a consecrated chalice into a bowl, representing the element of water. The novice carefully studies the procedure.

5. Together, they recite the incantation of water:

 "Flowing stream and oceans vast,
 Align with Sepheranz steadfast,
 Wealth, let the water currents bring,
 Abundance flow by the forces we sing."

6. The adept uses a sacred fan to summon the element of air, directing the wind towards the altar. The novice observes the mastery of this technique and learns.

7. The incantation of air is recited in harmony:

 "Mighty gales and whispered breeze,
 Sepheranz's eye on winds appease,
 Through air, bring fortune and desire,
 To earthly wealth, we all aspire."

8. The adept places soil and gemstones representing the element of earth onto the altar. The novice takes note.

9. The incantation of earth is recited together:

 "Solid earth, foundation strong,
 Sepheranz's eye, to you we throng,
 From soil to stone, wealth ascends,
 Material fortune, elemental blend."

10. The adept holds the aether gemstone high, and both the novice and adept concentrate on channelling ethereal energy into the ceremony.

11. They recite the incantation of aether:

 "Aether's force, unseen, untamed,
 In Sepheranz's eye, we claim,
 From higher realms, pull wealth below,
 Overflowing bounty, aether bestow."

12. The adept lights a black candle, representing the void. They encourage the novice to confront their fears, releasing them into the void.

13. Together, they recite the final incantation of void:

 "Boundless void, the absence claim,
 Sepheranz's eye, through you we aim,
 Dissolve the lack, bring riches near,
 Wealth manifests, in void appear."

### Part Two: Culmination of the Ritual

1. The adept joins all six gemstones and sigils in a circle on the altar, creating a powerful connection between the elements and the Elemental Eye of Sepheranz.

2. Both the novice and adept chant the following mantra, solidifying the energetic bond:

 "Sepheranz's Eye, elements unite,
 Through fire, water, earth, and air, ignite.
 Aether and void, powers transcend,
 Material wealth and opulence, to us extend."

3. The adept, with the novice's assistance, concludes the ritual by offering gratitude to the Elemental Eye of Sepheranz for the wealth that is about to be bestowed upon them.

4. They extinguish the central fire, signaling the end of the ceremony.

5. The ritual space is cleansed once more, and the gains from the ceremony are expected to manifest in the days, weeks, or months that follow.

Through this intricate ceremonial rite, spanning the precise utilization of the six elemental forces, both the adept and novice call upon the Elemental Eye of Sepheranz to align the elements and manifest an influx of material wealth and opulence.
