It is a practice that aims to dismantle the omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient power of an unknowable deity. This branch of esoteric knowledge diverges from the typical notions of devout worship or communion with divine forces and instead seeks to understand the mechanisms that govern the very existence of such an enigmatic entity. It is crucial to understand the magnitude and implications of this practice, as it deals with forces potentially beyond human comprehension.
