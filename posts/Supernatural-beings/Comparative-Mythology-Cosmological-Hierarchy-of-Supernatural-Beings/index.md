To construct a comprehensive cosmological hierarchy of supernatural beings, incorporating at least five diverse cultural and mythological systems and elucidate the relational dynamics between these beings that connect their nature, influence, and purpose on both spiritual and mundane planes, we will first identify the key features of each mythological system. For this purpose, we will focus on the following five systems: Greek, Hindu, Norse, Egyptian, and Japanese. 

Step 1: Identifying Key Features
Greek System: The Greek pantheon of gods, demigods, titans, and creatures represents a mix of various anthropomorphic deities with different domains (e.g., Zeus, god of thunder and ruler of Olympus; Athena, goddess of wisdom, etc.). The key features include moral ambiguity, greater emphasis on their lives and personalities, and the direct interference of gods in mortal lives.

**Hindu System**: One of the world's oldest mythological systems, the Hindu pantheon has a highly complex structure with a trinity of gods—Brahma (Creator), Vishnu (Preserver), and Shiva (Destroyer). The multitude of gods, goddesses, and mythical beings in Hinduism also covers aspects like avatars, celestial beings, and various spirits associated with the natural world. Key features include shared consorts between gods and goddesses, the cyclical character of creation, and an emphasis on spirituality.

**Norse System**: The Norse mythology features gods, giants, dwarves, elves, and other beings inhabiting different dimensions. The key gods include Thor, Odin, and Freyja, and there are numerous instances of conflict between gods and giants. Key features include the interconnected fate of gods and mortals, recurring battles, and the theme of Ragnarok, the foretold destruction of the gods.

**Egyptian System**: Egypt's gods and goddesses were often associated with aspects of nature and had animal or human characteristics. The pantheon includes Ra, Amun, Osiris, and Isis, among others. Key features include blending of animal and human forms, afterlife themes, and the Pharaoh's divine status.

**Japanese System**: Japanese mythology, known as Shinto, is focused on deities referred to as "kami." These spirits are manifestations of a divine force and include natural phenomena, ancestors, and sacred objects. Key features include primordial divine beings like Izanagi and Izanami, the emphasis on rituals and purity, and the emperor's divine ancestry.

Step 2: Defining the Cosmological Hierarchy
To create a hierarchy based on diverse systems, we will focus on the following levels:

1. Creator (Brahma, Ptah, Izanagi/Izanami)
2. Prime Deities (Zeus, Vishnu, Odin, Amun-Ra, Amaterasu)
3. Minor Deities (Aphrodite, Saraswati, Freyja, Isis, Inari)
4. Demigods, Heroes, and Celestial Beings (Heracles, Arjuna, Thor, Horus, Susano'o)
5. Spirits, Giants, Dwarves, Elves, etc. (Nymphs, Yakshas, Jotun, Djoser, Kitsune)

Step 3: Elucidating Relational Dynamics

1. **Creators**: These beings represent the creation force that kick-starts each cosmology. Generally, they play limited roles beyond setting the foundations and are mostly distant from mortal affairs—differing from Greek, Norse and Egyptian gods who engage more directly.
 
2. **Prime Deities**: As the chief gods, they exhibit ruling positions among their pantheons. They maintain balance in their respective domains, often driven to acts of heroism or even trickery. Their roles highlight the complex relationships between gods and mortals, with instances like the Avatars of Vishnu, Zeus' escapades, and Amaterasu's retreat showing their connection to the mundane.

3. **Minor Deities**: Usually holding domain over certain aspects, minor deities have more defined roles with certain boundaries. They tend to collaborate or compete with other deities, sometimes engaging with mortals to execute a particular goal.

4. Demigods, Heroes, and Celestial Beings: In addition to their intermediary status, these beings also possess qualities that link them to the divine. Most often, they are protagonists of epic literature that relates supernatural beings' influence on the mundane plane.

5. **Spirits and Mythical Beings**: These entities represent different aspects of culture and nature. By communicating with them or showing reverence, humans may access a sublime connection with the spiritual and natural worlds.

In conclusion, the proposed cosmological hierarchy incorporates Greek, Hindu, Norse, Egyptian, and Japanese mythological systems and the relational dynamics between these supernatural beings. This hierarchy connects the nature, influence, and purpose of these entities spanning both spiritual and mundane planes. In doing so, it reveals the shared themes and diversity of cultural beliefs and interpretations of the supernatural world.
