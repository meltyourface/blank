Hypothesis on the Genesis of Three Distinct Supernatural Symbols: 

1. The Pentagram
2. The Eye of Horus
3. The Triskele

1. **The Pentagram**:

The first symbol, the pentagram, is a five-pointed star enclosed in a circle. It is widely associated with various magical and supernatural practices. The genesis of the pentagram can be traced back to ancient Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations, where it was initially used for religious and mystical purposes. The pentagram was later adopted by the Pythagorean School of Greece, where it was revered as a symbol of mathematical perfection. 

In the medieval era, the pentagram was linked to the five senses and the five elements, making it significantly connected to occult rituals and practices. In Western esoteric traditions, the pentagram is often viewed as a protective emblem, warding off malevolent energies and evoking the five elements of earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. The pentagram's influence in popular culture can be seen in tarot cards, fantasy literature, and the contemporary Wiccan religion, alongside depictions in television and film, often invoking supernatural elements.

2. **The Eye of Horus**:

The second symbol, the Eye of Horus, is a highly significant ancient Egyptian symbol. It is an intricate symbol that includes a human eye and additional stylized marks, believed to represent the falcon-headed god Horus. The Eye of Horus was initially used in ancient Egyptian funerary amulets for protection and healing, specifically to ward off evil spirits.

The Eye of Horus has become closely associated with esoteric practices, with many speculating that the symbol represents the "third eye" or spiritual sight, allowing its wearer to see beyond the physical realm. Throughout history, the Eye of Horus has been revered as a symbol of protection, wisdom, and mystical knowledge. The Eye of Horus' significance in popular culture is evident in its usage in fashion, art, and contemporary spiritual practices, often symbolizing spiritual awakening and supernatural phenomena.

3. **The Triskele**:

The third symbol, the triskele, is a complex design consisting of three interlocking spirals or bent lines, radiating from a central point. The triskele has its origin in ancient European and Middle Eastern cultures, including Celtic and Greek societies. It is closely connected with the concept of the trinity, alluding to the realms of earth, water, and sky, or the body, mind, and spirit.

The triskele is often used in occult practices as a symbol of protection, balance, and harmony; its triple spiral design reflects the interconnected nature of existence. Throughout history, the triskele has been associated with various spiritual and mystical movements, including druidic practices, shamanism, and the goddess-centric traditions. In modern esoteric circles and popular culture, the triskele is often utilized as a symbol of perpetual motion, reflecting the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth.

In conclusion, the pentagram, the Eye of Horus, and the triskele are three distinct symbols that have deep roots in supernatural and occult practices throughout history. Their cultural significance and impact on modern esoteric traditions are undeniable, as they continue to captivate, intrigue, and provide lasting insight into the human fascination with the supernatural and mystical realms.
