Spell Name: Magna Potentia Amplificari

The Magna Potentia Amplificari is an intricate Witch-conception spell designed to exponentially amplify one's personal power and harness an abundance of energy. This spell is potent and not to be taken lightly. Those who practice this spell must ensure that they follow the detailed instructions, including proper incantations, components, and timeline to avoid undesirable repercussions.

Arcane Symbols:
1. Caelum Infinitum - Represents the infinite energy of the universe
2. Quaternus Vinculum - Represents the four elements bound together to create balance
3. Inexcitabilis Flamma - The unquenchable flame, symbolizing the eternal growth and expansion of one's power
4. Sanctus Exiguus - A connection to the divine and pure aspects of one's soul

**Components**:
1. Amara's Heart - A fist-sized red garnet crystal, for amplifying energy and unlocking dormant powers
2. Ebony mortar and pestle - For blending the herbs of the ritual
3. Ceremonial Athame - A double-edged dagger with a black handle, used for scribing symbols and directing energy
4. Fulminite Sands - To channel and absorb energy from the spell
5. White sage and mugwort - To cleanse the space and create a potent herbal blend
6. Moonflower petals and celestial water - To draw forth lunar energies and enhance the spell

Moon Phase:
This spell must be performed during the Full Moon to maximize potency and power. A Lunar Eclipse is even more ideal, though rare, as it boosts the intensity of the spell.

Ritualistic Steps:
1. Prepare a ritual altar with the components, facing the direction where the Full Moon rises.
2. Light the white sage and mugwort, allowing the smoke to cleanse the space around the altar. Leave the smoldering herbs on the altar.
3. With the ceremonial Athame, scribe the four arcane symbols around the perimeter of the altar. Place the Amara's Heart at the center.
4. Carefully, within the ebony mortar, blend the moonflower petals, fulminite sands, and celestial water together.
5. **Chant the incantation**:

    "Luna splendor, caelum infinities,
    Quaternus vinculum, magnum coniungere,
    Inexcitabilis flamma, potentiam expandere,
    Sanctus exiguus, divinam gratiam descendere."

6. Pour the blend gently over Amara's Heart, as the crystal emits a glowing light, responding to the incantation.
7. Remove the still-smoldering white sage and mugwort from the altar, carefully snuffing out the embers.
8. Meditate with the crystal and visualize the power building and expanding in sync with the lunar energy.

Elaborate Metaphysical Concepts, Consequences, and Side Effects:
Extra care must be taken to follow the steps precisely, as this spell connects the practitioner to infinite sources of energy and the Divine Spectrum. If any steps are skipped or altered, possible consequences include an uncontrollable overflow of energy, a sudden depletion of personal power, or a permanent disconnection from one's divine self.

Signs of a successful implementation include an increase in intuition, psychic abilities, and a deepened connection to the elements and the divine. However, be cautious, as exponentially amplifying one's power requires an equal amount of responsibility and morality.

Mastering the Magna Potentia Amplificari can have life-changing results, but it must be approached with respect and commitment. Wield your newfound power wisely and never underestimate the potential consequences of such a potent spell.
