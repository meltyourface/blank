In order to thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, let us first do a brief overview of the two works in question. 'The Castle of Otranto' by Horace Walpole, published in 1764, can be considered the first fully developed Gothic novel, and it sets the stage for many conventions that would later define the genre. In contrast, 'Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus' by Mary Shelley, published in 1818, presents a more mature example of the Gothic genre and delves deeper into the complexities and implications related to the human psyche, scientific advancements, and the nature of creation and responsibility.

Themes and Motifs:

1. **Supernatural and Uncanny**:
The Castle of Otranto is ripe with supernatural occurrences and eerie manifestations such as the giant helmet that crushes Conrad, the prophetic dream of the princess Isabella, walking portraits, and ghostly specters. These supernatural elements set the foundation for the Gothic literature that would follow, introducing readers to a world where reality and the fantastical intermingle.

In Frankenstein, the supernatural presents itself through the act of creating life from dead matter. While the novel does not dwell on supernatural phenomena like ghosts, the creation of the creature emphasizes the uncanny and challenges our perception of the natural order, raising questions about the limitations of science and the potential dangers of ambition.

2. **Overarching Emotions**:
Both novels pay immense attention to emotion, particularly those of fear, guilt, and despair. In The Castle of Otranto, the fear stems from the mysterious and supernatural circumstances that surround the castle, as well as the tyrannical rule of the protagonist, Manfred.

Frankenstein, on the other hand, focuses more on the fear of the consequences of actions, as well as the guilt and responsibility of Victor for the havoc unleashed by his creation. The novel also dwells on the despair and isolation experienced by both Victor and the creature, foregrounding psychological depth in the characters.

3. **The Sublime**:
Gothic literature is known for its exploration of the sublime, or the experience of vastness, beauty, and terror in the face of nature. The Castle of Otranto features the sublime in its description of the imposing castle and the surrounding picturesque landscape.

In Frankenstein, the sublime is even more prominently displayed through the descriptions of the Swiss Alps, the Orkney Islands, and the Arctic ice. These environments evoke a sense of awe and terror, mirroring the narrative's emotional intensity and amplifying the characters' isolation.

Philosophical, Societal, and Aesthetic Implications:

1. **Philosophical Concerns**:
In The Castle of Otranto, the moral lesson is more straightforward, emphasizing the importance of adhering to one's destiny and submitting to divine will. The tragedy is perceived as a result of Manfred's transgression and defiance against the natural order.

Frankenstein, however, concerns itself with more profound philosophical inquiries, such as the morality of playing God and creating life or the consequences of ambition and seeking knowledge beyond our limits. The novel engages with the ethical considerations inherent in scientific pursuits and the dilemma of responsibility that arises from our actions.

2. **Societal Implications**:
The Castle of Otranto presents the patriarchal society of the time, depicting the subjugation of women under male dominance. The novel yet serves as a critique of the dangers of tyrannical rule and the abuse of power.

Frankenstein explores societal implications related to the creature's development and behavior. The novel probes into themes on social rejection, prejudice, and the impact of nurture on one's character. Shelley humanizes the monster, eliciting sympathy from the reader and urging them to question societal norms and judgments.

3. **Aesthetic Impact**:
Walpole pioneered the Gothic genre with his integration of horror, romance, and fantastical elements, paving the way for subsequent authors to develop their unique Gothic styles. The Castle of Otranto's vivid descriptions and eerie atmosphere lay the foundation for what would become the benchmark for Gothic fiction.

Frankenstein, conversely, builds upon these Gothic conventions and adds further depth, particularly in terms of the novel's psychological complexity and philosophical reflections. Shelley's work continues to inform the horror genre today, presenting a cautionary tale that resonates well beyond its Gothic origins.

In conclusion, 'The Castle of Otranto' and 'Frankenstein' both contribute significantly to the shaping and development of Gothic literature through their respective themes and motifs. 'The Castle of Otranto' introduces the supernatural, the sublime, and intense emotions as hallmark features of the genre, while 'Frankenstein' builds upon these attributes and delves deeper into philosophical, societal, and aesthetic implications. Both novels convey the authors' intentions and address pressing concerns of their time, encapsulating the anxieties and societal tensions of the era in which they were written.
