To fully respond to the knowledge challenge on interrelating the concepts of Umbral body, the Jungian archetype of the Shadow, and the auras in ethereal planes as it pertains to the manifestation of a Ghostly shadow, we first need to understand the individual concepts and then synthesize their interrelationships. 

The Umbral Body:
The Umbral body, sometimes referred to as the shadow body or dark body, is a lesser-known aspect of an individual's spiritual anatomy. It is believed to be composed of condensed psychic and emotional energies. While the Umbral body is considered non-physical, it is said to have a significant influence on an individual's spiritual and mental well-being.

The Jungian Archetype of the Shadow:
According to Carl Jung, a renowned Swiss psychologist, the Shadow is one of the major archetypes found within the human psyche. Within the scope of Jungian psychology, the Shadow represents the unconscious aspect of an individual's personality that is primarily composed of repressed elements, such as desires, fears, and instinctual urges. It often embodies characteristics and traits that the conscious ego does not accept. The Shadow can manifest as negative emotions and can play a vital role in an individual's psychological growth.

Auras in Ethereal Planes:
Auras are a concept found in various esoteric, spiritual, and metaphysical practices and belief systems. An aura is an energy field emanating from living beings that encompasses physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects. Auras are often associated with the subtle or ethereal bodies, which include a series of interconnected energy fields that exist in multiple planes of existence. These planes, known as ethereal planes, are believed to be vibrational dimensions where non-physical entities, such as spirits and energy beings, may reside.

Interrelation of the Concepts:
The convergence of these concepts begins when we consider the connections between the Umbral body, the Jungian Shadow archetype, and ethereal planes' auras. The Umbral body, a condensed form of psychic and emotional energies, has significant parallels with Jung's Shadow archetype, which represents the unconscious aspects of an individual's personality. As the Umbral body influences a person's spiritual and mental well-being, it directly interacts with the aura, which reflects the individual's energetic state.

Manifestation of a Ghostly Shadow:
Ghostly shadows may be considered as manifestations that arise from the intertwining of the Umbral body, the Jungian Shadow, and auras in ethereal planes. Ghostly shadows can represent the physical or apparitional forms of the repressed elements of an individual's personality combined with their condensed psychic and emotional energy, which gets projected into the ethereal planes.

Significance for Both the Individual and Collective Unconscious:
The manifestation of a Ghostly shadow holds profound significance for both the individual and the collective unconscious. At the individual level, encountering a Ghostly shadow may facilitate a deep confrontation with one's Shadow archetype. This confrontation could potentially lead to a process of integration and self-awareness, often referred to as "Shadow work." By accepting and understanding the darker aspects of their personality, one can reach a higher level of psychological growth, spiritual development, and mental well-being.

At the collective level, the concept of Ghostly shadows reinforces the interconnectedness of all living beings. As the collective unconscious is a layer of the unconscious mind shared among all humans, the manifestation of Ghostly shadows may offer glimpses into the shared fears, desires, and instincts that reside there. Recognizing these patterns and themes may lead to a greater collective understanding and ultimately contribute to the spiritual and psychological growth of humanity as a whole.

In summary, the interrelation between the concepts of Umbral body, the Jungian archetype of the Shadow, and the auras in ethereal planes comes together in the manifestation of Ghostly shadows. These Ghostly shadows represent the connection between the repressed aspects of an individual's psyche, their energies, and the ethereal existences. The progression of the soul through these phenomena holds considerable significance for both the individual and collective unconscious, facilitating further spiritual growth and understanding about the interconnectedness within the human psyche.
