description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Ghostly shadow, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Delve into the enigmatic realm of the Ghostly shadow and meticulously craft a series of arcane, written invocations specially designed for summoning five distinct categories of spirits, including earthbound spirits, elementals, ancestral ghosts, shadowy apparitions, and otherworldly entities. Ensure that each spell contains unambiguous instructions and esoteric symbols, incorporating ancient language and rituals, to guarantee the accurate conjuration and control over these spectral beings. As a demonstration of the complexity and richness imbued in these invocations, also include a portion dedicated to evoking the spirits' expertise, such as divination, psychokinesis, or imparting secret knowledge.
