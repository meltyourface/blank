The Cosmic Mirror spread represents the querent's self-realization journey through the lens of Theia Mania. This unique spread utilizes sacred geometry by aligning the three cards to form an inverted triangle, signifying the descent into the depths of the psyche.

In this spread, The Fool embodies the querent's untapped potential and eagerness for new beginnings. As the journey unfolds, The High Priestess represents the querent's deepened connection to their intuition and the mysteries of the psychic realm, while maintaining balance between the conscious and the subconscious. Finally, The Moon signifies the querent's exploration of their shadow side and the world of illusion in the pursuit of transformation.

Through this spread, the querent discovers the arcane wisdom of Theia Mania hidden within their subconscious mind, enabling them to access untapped spiritual resources for growth and self-transformation.

Spread 2: The Astral Triad
Cards: The Magician, The Chariot, and The World

The Astral Triad spread delves into the querent's spiritual journey through astral hagiography, a study of the sacred stories intertwining spiritual beings and celestial influencers. Three cards are placed in a triangular formation, symbolizing the elements of creation: fire, water, and air.

The Magician embodies the querent's power to manifest and shape their reality through the art of will and determination. As the querent reaches higher spiritual planes, The Chariot represents the union of opposing forces, guiding them towards victory and self-mastery. Completing the triad, The World signifies the querent's cosmic consciousness and harmony within the celestial plane, culminating in the completion of their spiritual journey.

Interpreting this spread reveals the querent's connections to the divine and their role within the cosmic theater of astral hagiography. The Arcane power provided by Theia Mania aids in shaping the querent's purpose in the celestial realm and finding balance in their spiritual evolution.

Spread 3: The Talismanic Labyrinth
Cards: The Wheel of Fortune, The Tower, and The Star

The Talismanic Labyrinth spread explores the querent's spiritual journey and transformation through the complex layers of recondite talismans and alchemical processes. This spread consists of three concentric circles, each representing a level of depth within the querent's soul.

The first circle is The Wheel of Fortune, embodying the querent's understanding of fate and destiny, as well as the cyclical nature of life's experiences. Within the second circle lies The Tower, signifying a sudden upheaval that challenges the querent's foundationâ€”a necessary catalyst for transformation. The final circle holds The Star, a symbol of hope and inspiration emerging from the darkness, signaling spiritual rebirth and enlightenment.

The Talismanic Labyrinth spread allows the querent to traverse through the mystifying realms of emotional and spiritual alchemy in search of inner wisdom and clarity.
