Answer:

To design a personalized oracle of geomancy ritual, let us first understand the basics of geomancy, geomantic figures, and elemental associations. Geomancy is a form of divination that relies on the interpretation of 16 figures formed by combinations of points, each figure representing a specific energy or force in nature. Each of these figures is associated with an element – Earth, Air, Fire, or Water. The elemental associations play an integral role in the interpretation of the figures, as they help to anchor the energies they represent within the context of the question or situation being assessed.

For this personalized ritual, we will be incorporating three geomantic figures – Puella (the Girl), Rubeus (Red), and Conjunctio (The Conjunction). We will then create a hypothetical scenario in which this ritual can be performed to answer a question related to different aspects of the subject's life.

1. **Puella (the Girl)**:

**Element**: Water
Symbolism: Harmony, balance, beauty, love, relationships, and receptivity.

Puella represents the nurturing and compassionate aspects of the feminine archetype. It symbolizes balance, grace, and beauty; as well as the power of attraction and forming connections. When Puella appears in a reading, it often suggests that relationships, love, and emotional well-being are coming to the forefront of the subject's life.

2. **Rubeus (Red)**:

**Element**: Air
Symbolism: Passion, desire, revolution, transformation, and agitation.

Rubeus signifies intense energy, dynamic change, and transformative power. It evokes strong emotions – both positive and negative. As an Air-ruled figure, it represents the volatile, ever-changing nature of thoughts and ideas. When Rubeus appears, it alerts the subject to be aware of the tumultuous and unpredictable forces at work in their life, which could lead to sudden changes and upheavals.

3. **Conjunctio (The Conjunction)**:

**Element**: Earth
Symbolism: Union, communication, collaboration, meeting, and agreements.

Conjunctio represents the joining together of different forces, energies, or people in a harmonious and cooperative manner. It signifies communication, partnerships, and the binding together of seemingly disparate elements to create something new, stable, and beneficial. Conjunctio often indicates fruitful collaborations, joint ventures, or the forging of supportive relationships.

Hypothetical scenario and question:

Imagine a woman seeking guidance on improving her romantic relationship. **She is in a long-term partnership and is facing communication difficulties with her partner, leading to misunderstandings and distance between them. She asks the oracle**: "What can I do to improve the communication and deepen the connection with my partner?"

1. Firstly, draw Puella to represent the potential for growth, balance, and harmony within her relationship. The presence of Puella suggests that through open communication, understanding, and expression of love, they can strengthen their bond and restore equilibrium to their partnership. The Water element of Puella emphasizes the importance of emotional openness and a receptive attitude.

2. Next, draw Rubeus as a reminder to acknowledge and address the underlying passions, desires, and emotions driving their communication issues. The Air element here indicates that the subject should be mindful of her thoughts and assumptions about her partner and allow space for honest conversation about their individual needs and feelings. By confronting these intense emotions, they can undergo the necessary transformations to overcome their obstacles.

3. **Finally, draw Conjunctio as a symbol of the ultimate goal**: enhanced communication and collaboration between the partners. The Earth element of Conjunctio points to the potential for a more grounded, stable foundation for their relationship, built on mutual understanding and commitment.

In summary, this personalized oracle of geomancy ritual incorporates the geomantic figures of Puella (the Girl), Rubeus (Red), and Conjunctio (The Conjunction) to provide guidance for the subject in improving communication and deepening connection within her romantic relationship. By understanding the symbolism of these figures and the elemental associations, the subject can gain insights into the roles of balance, transformation, and collaboration in their partnership, ultimately working towards a more harmonious and fulfilling love life.
