To craft this multi-layered protection incantation, we will first create each layer individually and then integrate them together into one cohesive protective charm. I present to you the Ward of Boundless Aegis:

**Layer One: Barrier Spell**
To establish the initial barrier spell to repel common curses such as the Evil Eye, Bindings, and Maledictions, chant the following incantation:

_Infrangere lumen, viscus tela,
Excutere maledictum, nexumque, ocellum malum.
Ensis securitas, impetum frangere,
Perpetuus vigor, hanc praesidio valere._

As you recite these words, envision a swirling sphere of white energy surrounding your body, repelling any intrusive forces that may attempt to influence or harm you.

**Layer Two: Absorption Enchantment**
Next, you'll incorporate the secondary absorption enchantment to neutralize hexes. To do this, place a piece of obsidian and black tourmaline on either side of the talisman or amulet. With the crystals in place, recite:

_Obsidianum, tourmalinus niger,
Imbibere ex maledictis potentia,
Negativum transemittunt, purgare vitium,
Lucerna transformat, ardens excubitor._

As you speak these words, imagine the energy from the crystals connecting and intertwining, creating a protective web that absorbs any hexes or curses that slip past the first layer.

**Layer Three: Reflection Charm**
To establish the tertiary reflection charm, draw the desired sigil of mirrored energy on the talisman or amulet using an ink made from consecrated water and silver dust. Once the sigil is drawn, recite:

_Pellucida incantamentum, retro vertente maleficia,
Cassis tueri, umbratum monitus,
Dirigere rursus, nostrum hostibus,
Creber obsisto, ultor relumine._

Envision the sigil glowing a vibrant blue hue, reflecting any remaining malevolent forces back upon their casters.

**Talisman/Amulet Creation and Consecration**
Now that you have crafted the multi-layered protection incantation, it is time to encapsulate its energy into a wearable talisman or amulet. Choose a material that holds personal significance to you and carve or mold your desired shape. To maximize its efficacy, it is advisable to use metal with a high affinity for potent energies, such as silver.

Once the talisman/amulet is crafted, consecrate it by placing it in a mixture of consecrated water, sea salt, and assorted protective herbs (e.g., sage, rosemary, etc.) Allow the item to soak for 24 hours while reciting the individual layers' incantations, imbuing it with their combined power.

After 24 hours, remove the talisman/amulet and perform the following activation and binding ritual:

1. Place the talisman/amulet in the center of a circle of white candles.
2. Light each candle, starting from the east and moving clockwise.
3. Speak the following words:

_Onus huius oraculum, protego coniungo,
Triplex scutum, numquam lapsurus,
Meum et oraculum, perpetuus custodio,
Hinc ad aliam vitam, aeternum reverenti._

Upon completion of this ritual, your talisman/amulet will now hold the full power of the Ward of Boundless Aegis, providing you with multi-layered protection against hexes and malicious energies.
