To create an authentic natal chart using traditional English magic practices, we need to gather some essential information and follow certain steps. In this task, I don't have the individual's birth data, so I will provide a general guide that one can use to create a natal chart.

1. **Gathering Birth Data**: Collect the date, time, and place of birth. Accurate data is essential for a precise chart.

2. **Determine the Planetary Hours**: Calculate the planetary hours based on the time and date of birth. **Each dayâ€™s 24 hours are split between the seven Chaldean planets**: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Each planet rules for an hour, following the Chaldean order: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon. Start at sunrise with the planetary hour of the ruling planet of the day and continue assigning planetary hours.

3. **Calculate the Ascendant**: Compute the exact degree of the Ascendant (or Rising sign) according to the time and location of birth. The Ascendant represents the person's outer appearance and general approach to life.

4. **Identify House Positions**: Once the Ascendant is determined, distribute the Zodiac signs around the 12 houses, starting with the Ascendant at the first house. Each house relates to a different area of a person's life.

5. **Identify Planetary Positions**: Using an ephemeris (a table or book containing the positions of celestial objects at regular intervals), find the positions of the planets, Chiron, and the Lunar Nodes in the Zodiac signs at the exact time of birth.

6. **Incorporate Chaldean Sigils and Talisman Designs**: Calculate and draw the sigils for each planet and prepare talismans according to the Chaldean correspondences:

   a. Sun - For vitality, success, and authority. Gold, symbols of lions, eagles, and circles.
   b. Moon - For emotions, psychic abilities, and travel. Silver, depictions of crescents, and images of women.
   c. Mars - For energy, courage, and assertiveness. Iron or red metals, scorpions, and images of warriors or weapons.
   d. Mercury - For communication, travel, and knowledge. Mercury or mixed metals, images of birds, and symbols of Mercury.
   e. Jupiter - For expansion, growth, and abundance. Tin, images of eagles, thunderbolts, and symbols of the planet itself.
   f. Venus - For love, beauty, and harmony. Copper, pictures of roses, doves, and the glyph for Venus.
   g. Saturn - For discipline, limitation, and structure. Lead, images of elderly people, goats, and symbols of the planet.

7. **Create the Natal Chart**: Draw the 12 houses, signs, and aspects (angles) between planets, using traditional English magic symbols for the planets, signs, and aspects. Include sigils, talismans, and material correspondences.

8. **Interpretations**: Analyze the natal chart according to traditional English occult astrology. This involves examining the positions of the planets, signs, houses, aspects, Chaldean planetary associations, sigils, and talismans, and providing insight and guidance based on these complex principles.

Remember that this is only a general guide. To create an accurate natal chart, one must have the subject's exact birth data. Each chart is unique and requires a deep understanding of the individual's life circumstances and goals.
