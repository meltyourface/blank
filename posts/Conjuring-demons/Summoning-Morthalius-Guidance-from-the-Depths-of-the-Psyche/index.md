1. Desired Demon's Attributes and Realm of Expertise:

The demon we seek to summon is Morthalius, an ancient entity specializing in wisdom, knowledge, and the uncovering of hidden secrets. Morthalius possesses profound insight into the depths of the psyche, offering guidance and inspiration to those who call upon it. However, Morthalius expects a fair exchange: its valuable guidance often requires relinquishing specific attachments or beliefs.

2. Unique Sigil Design:

Morthalius's sigil consists of an eye motif representing the all-seeing nature of its deep wisdom, surrounded by twisting, maze-like lines. These lines signify the complex paths of exploration that one must undertake to access secretive knowledge. A serpent encircles the entire design, symbolizing transformative power and the shedding of limiting beliefs.

3. Activating the Sigil Using the Spare Method:

The Austin Osman Spare method for activating the sigil requires an altered state of consciousness, or gnosis, achieved by intense focus or sensory deprivation. To use this method for summoning Morthalius, follow these steps:

a. Enter the ideal environment (described in detail below).
b. Begin by meditating to clear the mind. Focus on emptying the mind of all thoughts and distractions.
c. Once the mind is sufficiently clear, concentrate on your intention to summon Morthalius and receive its guidance.
d. Draw Morthalius's sigil on parchment or paper while maintaining your intention, using ink charged with your own essence (such as blood, saliva, or a drop of sweat).
e. Gaze intently at the sigil, using breathwork and deep breathing techniques to facilitate a trance-like state of mind.
f. Continue to focus on the sigil, allowing its form to merge with your consciousness until it becomes an intrinsic part of your mental landscape.
g. Close your eyes and visualize the sigil glowing with energy, sealing the summoning process.

4. Ideal Environment:

The ideal environment for summoning Morthalius is a secluded, dimly lit space, free from distractions. The location should be infused with an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue, such as a private study filled with ancient books and artifacts. Perform the ritual during the night, when the veil between worlds is thinnest, preferably during the new moon to enhance the energy of secret-seeking. Arrange candles, crystals, and incense to create a spiritually charged atmosphere.

5. Additional Elements:

Incorporate the following elements to enhance the ritual's effectiveness and safety:

a. Protective circle: Before beginning the ritual, draw a protective circle around yourself, using salt or chalk. This circle serves to keep out unwanted influences during the summoning process.
b. Offerings: Offer Morthalius incense, candles, and small tokens representing knowledge or wisdom, such as books or papyrus scrolls, to secure its favor.
c. Incantations: Chant a simple mantra, such as, "Morthalius, wise one, share your insight with me, and I shall grow," to reinforce your intention and commitment to the exchange.
d. Banishing: After the ritual, thank Morthalius for its guidance and presence. Use a banishing incantation or the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to close the portal and ensure no lingering energies remain.

6. Potential Outcomes and Manifestations:

Signs of a successful ritual may include heightened intuition, vivid dreams, or the sudden uncovering of hidden information. Repeated conjurations may lead to a deepening relationship with Morthalius, yielding richer insights. However, always remain vigilant for signs of psychic imbalance or attachment to specific outcomes, as Morthalius's wisdom may sometimes be challenging to integrate. Should difficulties arise, reevaluate your approach, reaffirm your intentions and protections, and adapt your methods accordingly.
