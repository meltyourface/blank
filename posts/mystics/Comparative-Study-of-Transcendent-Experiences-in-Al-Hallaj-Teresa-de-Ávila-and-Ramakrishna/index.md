Answering this knowledge challenge requires us to first dive into the lives and mystical experiences of Al-Hallaj, Teresa of Ávila, and Ramakrishna. After understanding their backgrounds and spiritual accomplishments, we can analyze the interconnectedness of their experiences with various esoteric traditions and cultural influences. Identifying their shared motifs, synchronicities, and distinct divergences will help us ascertain the greater unifying principles in their paths to transcendence.

Backgrounds and Mystical Experiences:
1. ****Al-Hallaj (858-922 CE)****: A Persian Sufi mystic and poet, Al-Hallaj is famous for his controversial statements, such as "Ana al-Haqq" (I am the Truth). This led to his execution as it was seen as a claim to divinity. His mystical experiences often revolved around states of ecstasy, divine union, and spiritual intoxication. He was influenced by Sufism, Gnosticism, and ancient Persian mysticism.
2. ****Teresa of Ávila (1515-1582 CE)****: A Spanish mystic, writer, and reformer, Teresa of Ávila was a prominent figure in Christian mysticism. Famous for her visions and deep prayer, she authored works like "Interior Castle" and "The Way of Perfection," which detailed her experiences and paths to mystical union with God. She was a member of the Carmelite Order and was heavily influenced by Catholic doctrine and European Christian mysticism.
3. ****Ramakrishna (1836-1886 CE)****: A 19th-century Indian mystic, Ramakrishna was influential in the religious renaissance of Bengal and other parts of India. He had numerous mystical experiences, culminating in the realization of the unity of all religions. Ramakrishna practiced different faiths like Islam, Christianity, and various Hindu traditions. His teachings inspired the formation of the Ramakrishna Mission, which propagates the message of universal harmony in spirituality.

Interconnectedness with various esoteric traditions and cultural influences:
Al-Hallaj's experiences were impacted by Sufism, a prominent tradition emphasizing direct experience of God. Sufi practices like "dhikr" (remembrance of God) and "fana" (annihilation of the self) bear similarities to Al-Hallaj's ecstatic experiences. Similarly, Teresa of Ávila was profoundly influenced by Christian mysticism, specifically the "via negativa" (negative way) and "via positiva" (positive way) approaches to God. Ramakrishna's experiences straddled various religious traditions, exemplifying the synthesis of multiple spiritual paths and demonstrating the universality of spiritual truth.

Shared motifs and synchronicities:
1. ****Union with the Divine****: All three figures emphasized the importance of divine union in their mystical experiences, albeit within the context of their respective faiths.
2. ****Mystical experiences****: They each underwent profound and transformative experiences, often comprising visions, divine encounters, and ecstatic states.
3. ****Emphasis on practice****: Each mystic stressed the significance of spiritual practice - Al-Hallaj through Sufi techniques, Teresa via deep prayer and contemplation, and Ramakrishna via diverse religious practices.

Distinct divergences:
1. ****Cultural contexts****: Each mystic's experiences are deeply rooted in their respective cultural and religious paradigms, resulting in different understandings of the divine, the self, and the path to transcendence.
2. ****Expression of mystical insights****: Their expressions varied due to their historical contexts and religious revelations. Al-Hallaj's outspokenness led to his execution, whereas Teresa's writings influenced Christian mysticism, and Ramakrishna's syncretic practices inspired interfaith dialogue.

Greater unifying principles:
1. ****The primacy of direct experience****: All three figures emphasized direct experience of transcendence over dogma or doctrine, validating the importance of genuine spiritual encounters.
2. ****The universal potential for spiritual realization****: Their lives and teachings underscore that spiritual truth transcends particular religious traditions, encouraging seekers to find the divine within various paths.
3. ****Transformation through spiritual practice****: They all demonstrated that disciplined practice leads to transcendence, highlighting the value of dedication and commitment to spiritual growth.

In conclusion, the lives and experiences of Al-Hallaj, Teresa of Ávila, and Ramakrishna showcase a tapestry of interconnectedness, shared motifs, and divergences that span across different esoteric traditions and cultural influences. A deeper understanding of these mystical figures provides crucial insights into the unifying principles of their transcendental experiences, emphasizing the importance of direct spiritual encounters, universal potential for divine realization, and the transformative power of spiritual practice.
