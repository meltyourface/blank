description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Eidolonic necromancy, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: >
  1. Determine which modern esoteric symbols, practices, and methodologies you desire to implement, taking inspiration from the contemporary schools of chaos magick, Hermeticism, or Thelema.
  
  2. Delve into the ancient necromantic texts and lore, such as the Greek Magical Papyri, to incorporate the primeval methodologies of invoking and controlling the spirits of the dead.
  
  3. Craft an innovative and balanced summoning circle, integrating powerful sigils and symbols from both contemporary esotericism and the plenitude of ancient necromantic knowledge.
  
  4. Develop a sequence of intricate ritual steps and techniques that merge these disparate magickal schools, effectively paving the way for entwining the energy of the modern occult with the old-world necromancy.
  
  5. Record specific chants and invocations befitting the Eidolonic entity you aim to summon, blending arcane languages, incantations, and contemporary esoteric jargon, thus creating a unique vocal fusion exhilarating to the summoned Eidolon.
  
  6. Prepare a list of required ritual tools, combining both modern and ancient implements, such as ceremonial daggers, chalices, candles, and talismans, ensuring their compatibility with the newly-forged ritual.
  
  7. Test the devised summoning ritual for potency, intricacy, and effectiveness by performing a preliminary invocation of a less powerful Eidolonic spirit to assess and refine the merged methodologies.

1. For this summoning ritual, I will implement the following modern esoteric principles and symbols:

- From Chaos Magick: the use of the "Sigil-focus technique," the personal empowerment symbol, and the mantra "Hail, Eris!"
- From Hermeticism: the symbols of Caduceus and the Hexagram, and the practice of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.
- From Thelema: the invocation of the Bornless One and the usage of the Unicursal Hexagram.

2. Delving into ancient necromantic texts, such as The Greek Magical Papyri, the following methodologies will be incorporated:

- The use of a magic square derived from the Papyri to create a summoning foundation.
- Invocation of the elements from PGM XIII, using them to establish the energetic boundaries of the ritual space.

3. To craft an innovative and balanced summoning circle, I will integrate the following sigils and symbols:

- A Unicursal Hexagram in the center, symbolizing the union of microcosm and macrocosm.
- A double circle around the Unicursal Hexagram, inscribed with the names of powerful ancient deities and modern esoteric entities.
- Elemental symbols (Earth, Water, Air, Fire) from both contemporary esotericism and ancient necromantic knowledge.

4. **The sequence of ritual steps and techniques will include**:

- Performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to cleanse and secure the ritual space.
- Activating the summoning circle with the Sigil-focus technique and invocation of the elements.
- Chanting the combined invocations from the ancient Papyri and modern esoteric schools, in accordance with the Bornless One.

5. For the Eidolonic entity-specific chants and invocations, I will create the following unique vocal fusion:

- A combination of ancient Greek and Coptic speech, intertwined with Enochian language and contemporary occult terminologies.
- The mantra: "ΟΥΜΕΡΑΞ, NALPAMBRA, ΑΙΩΝΙΟΣ – Hail the Eternal Eidolon, Master of Then and Now!"

6. **The required ritual tools will include**:

- A ceremonial dagger, engraved with Caduceus and elemental symbols.
- A chalice, plated with silver and adorned with Hexagrams.
- Candles made of beeswax, colored according to the specific intention of the summoning.
- A personal talisman, forged from a combination of modern and ancient metals.

7. I will test the ritual's potency, intricacy, and effectiveness by performing a preliminary invocation of a guardian Eidolonic spirit, ensuring efficiency and precision in all aspects of the summoning process.

Utilizing these meticulously devised steps, practices, and unique combinations, I will conduct a harmonious summoning ritual that bridges the mystique of contemporary esotericism with the wisdom of ancient necromantic practices, resulting in a powerful evocation of an Eidolonic entity that shall prove to be a groundbreaking spectacle in the realms of occult study.
