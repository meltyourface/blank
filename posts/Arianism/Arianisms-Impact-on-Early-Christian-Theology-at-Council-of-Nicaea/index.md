  To provide a comprehensive response to the knowledge challenge at hand, we'll delve into the history and development of Arianism, and examine how it played a crucial role in shaping religious thought during the Council of Nicaea. We will also discuss the influential political alliances and key figures that contributed to the schism between Arianism and Orthodox Christianity, and finally, explore the continued impact of this dynamic on the spiritual landscape in the centuries that followed.
  
  Arianism, named after its founder Arius, a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, was a theological doctrine that emerged in the 4th century AD. A central tenet of Arianism was the belief in the subordination and distinctness of the Son (Jesus) from the Father (God). In essence, followers of this doctrine argued that Jesus was divine, but not coequal and coeternal with God, ascribing to him a lesser status in the Holy Trinity.
  
  The Council of Nicaea, convened in AD 325 by Emperor Constantine I, brought together bishops from the Eastern and Western regions of the Roman Empire to address the growing religious discord spurred by Arianism and other heretical doctrines. This council marked a significant turning point in the development of Christian theology and the establishment of orthodoxy.
  
  Political alliances and key figures played major roles in the Arian controversy and the subsequent schism. Emperor Constantine I, despite his apparent impartiality, sought to strengthen the empire and promote religious cohesion through unifying Christian doctrine. His support was crucial to the adoption of the Nicene Creed, a formal declaration of Christian faith which refuted the Arian belief and expounded on the consubstantiality (shared divine essence) of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
  
  Other notable figures included Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, who was an ardent advocate of this new orthodoxy and would continue to staunchly oppose Arianism throughout his life, even at the risk of personal persecution. On the other side, Eusebius of Nicomedia emerged as a prominent pro-Arian bishop, championing the cause in the imperial court even after the council's decision.
  
  The dynamics between Arianism and Orthodox Christianity had far-reaching consequences for the spiritual landscape in the centuries to come. The ongoing theological disputes and intermittent resurgences of Arianism led to a series of councils, culminating in the Council of Constantinople in AD 381, which reaffirmed and further established the orthodox position against Arianism.
  
  Nevertheless, Arianism continued to influence various Germanic tribes, like the Visigoths and Vandals, who adopted the doctrine during their migration into the Western Roman Empire. As a result, Arianism persisted as a viable theological alternative, leading to tensions and conflicts between the Arian rulers and the Nicene clergy. Eventually, the Arian Germanic kingdoms were either converted back to orthodoxy or overthrown, thus subduing the influence of Arianism in the Western Europe.
  
  In conclusion, the influence of Arianism on the development of religious thought during the Council of Nicaea and beyond is multifaceted. The political alliances and key figures involved significantly contributed to the schism between Arianism and Orthodox Christianity, which in turn shaped the spiritual landscape for centuries. While Arianism was eventually suppressed, both by the establishment of orthodox doctrine in the Eastern Roman Empire and the conversion of Arian-ruled Western regions, the impact of this doctrine and the tensions it generated can still be observed in the rich and complex history of early Christianity.
