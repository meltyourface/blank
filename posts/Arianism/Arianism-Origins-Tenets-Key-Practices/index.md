## Arianism - Foundations, Historical Development, and Key Practices 

### I. Introduction

Arianism, an esoteric branch of occultism, has roots in the early years of Christianity and has developed a unique set of principles, practices, and historical context that distinguishes it as a specialized area of study. This section aims to elucidate the foundational concepts, explore historical development, and introduce students to key practices, providing them with the necessary knowledge to advance their understanding of Arianism. 

### II. Foundational Concepts

Arianism finds its name from its founder, Arius, a theologian from Alexandria, Egypt who lived between 256 - 336 CE. The primary tenets of Arianism revolve around the nature of the relationship between God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. As a result, Arianism diverges from the mainstream Christian view of the Holy Trinity in the following ways:

1. **The distinction between God (the Father) and Christ (the Son)**: Arianism posits that Jesus (the Son) is not equal to or coeternal with God (the Father) and is instead a created being with divine attributes. This is known as Subordinationism.
2. **The nature of the Holy Spirit**: In Arianism, the Holy Spirit is considered as created by both the Father and the Son, and not being equal to either, playing a subordinate role.

### III. Historical Development

Arianism's emergence in the 4th century led to a great deal of controversy within the early Christian Church and sparked multiple theological discussions and attempts at refutation. **Key historical events include**:

1. The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) - Convened by Emperor Constantine in an effort to unify Christian doctrine, this council aimed to address the debate between Arianism and its opposition, namely advocates for the idea of Christ's coeternal nature as proposed by St. Athanasius. The council resulted in the drafting of the Nicene Creed as a declaration against Arian principles.
2. The spread of Arianism - Although the Council of Nicaea had condemned Arianism, its ideas continued to spread across Europe, particularly among the Germanic tribes.
3. The subsequent decline - Arianism's influence began to fade in the 5th to 7th centuries as the Germanic tribes that had adopted it either converted to other forms of Christianity (e.g., Orthodoxy, Catholicism) or disappeared entirely.

### IV. Key Practices

Despite its gradual decline, those seeking to explore Arianism can still embrace its principles and engage in practices that reflect the foundational concepts. **Here are a few key practices that students may choose to adopt**:

1. Study of ancient texts - To fully understand Arianism, it is essential to engage with historical writings on the subject, including the works of Arius himself as well as other Arian theologians.
2. Prayer and meditation - Focusing on the relationship between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as distinct entities provides an opportunity for spiritual exploration and connection with one's personal beliefs.
3. Reflection on personal faith - Exploring Arianism requires reconciling its doctrine with one's spiritual views and treating it as an opportunity to enrich one's faith journey.
4. Engaging in dialogue - Open discussion of Arianism and its principles with other like-minded individuals can facilitate a deeper understanding and appreciation of its historical significance.

### V. Conclusion

Arianism serves as an essential piece of the esoteric and occult tapestry, offering a historical perspective on Christian theological thought and demonstrating the evolution and diversity of religious beliefs. Delving into the foundational concepts, understanding its historical development, and engaging in key practices will undoubtedly provide invaluable insights for students on their path to occult education and spiritual growth.
