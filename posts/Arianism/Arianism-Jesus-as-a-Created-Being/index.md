Answer: Jesus is a created being and not equal to God the Father in essence.

Explanation: Arianism is a theological doctrine associated with the early Christian theologian Arius, who lived in the 4th century AD. This belief system emphasizes the distinction between the Father and the Son (Jesus Christ) in the Holy Trinity, claiming that Jesus is a created being and not equal to God the Father in essence. This doctrine contrasts with traditional Trinitarian Christianity, which asserts that Jesus is co-eternal and equal in essence to God the Father.

Arius and his followers argued that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, had a beginning and was created by God the Father, hence rendering him distinct from the Father in terms of essence and nature. They derived this understanding from various biblical passages, such as Proverbs 8:22-31, where Wisdom (interpreted as Jesus) was described as created before the formation of the cosmos.

The assertion "Jesus is co-eternal and equal in essence to God the Father" corresponds to the doctrine of the Nicene Creed, which was created in reaction to Arianism during the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. This creed formulated the standard Trinitarian doctrine accepted by most of Christianity today.

The assertion "Jesus is simply a human prophet and not divine in any sense" resonates with certain streams within Unitarianism and Islam, which deny Jesus' divinity altogether. While Arianism maintains that Jesus is a created being, it does not deny his divine aspect.

Finally, the assertion "Jesus and God the Father are interchangeable, representing the same being" aligns with the doctrine of modalism or Sabellianism, which sees the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as different modes or manifestations of the same divine being, rather than distinct persons coexisting within the Godhead.

In summary, within the context of Arianism, the most accurate statement regarding the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ is that Jesus is a created being and not equal to God the Father in essence. Arianism, as an influential early Christian theological movement, has largely been deemed a heresy by mainstream Christianity, with the Trinitarian doctrine established at the Council of Nicaea prevailing since the 4th century AD.
