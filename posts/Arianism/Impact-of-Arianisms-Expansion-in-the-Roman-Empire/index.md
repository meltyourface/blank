Emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan

The Edict of Milan (313 AD) was a proclamation issued by the Roman Emperors Constantine the Great and Licinius, which declared the religious tolerance of Christianity within the Roman Empire. This event did not exemplify the influence and expansion of Arianism because it was focused on the broader acceptance of Christianity and not on the specific promotion of Arianism. It provided a level playing field for various Christian factions, including Arians, to coexist and grow without direct state interference.

In contrast, the other options have a direct link to the influence and expansion of Arianism:

1. **The conversion of the Germanic tribes during the 4th to 6th century**: The Goths and several other Germanic tribes adopted Arian Christianity when they converted from paganism, leading to the establishment of Arianism in many parts of the Western Roman Empire. This significantly extended the influence of Arianism and became a significant challenge to orthodox Christianity.

2. **The Council of Sardica in 343 AD**: The council was called to address the schism within the Christian Church due to Arianism. Though initially aimed at healing the divide, it ultimately resulted in two separate councilsâ€”one in Sardica (now Sofia, Bulgaria) supporting the Nicene Creed and the other in Philippopolis (now Plovdiv, Bulgaria) supporting Arianism. This event highlights a critical moment of Arianism's growth and its challenge to orthodox Christianity.

3. **The baptism and Arian conversion of the Gothic king Wulfila**: Wulfila was a missionary bishop who is responsible for translating the Bible into Gothic language and converting many Goths to Arian Christianity. He played a crucial role in the expansion of Arianism and made significant contributions to its missionary work.

In summary, while the Edict of Milan played an essential part in advancing religious tolerance and general acceptance of Christianity within the Roman Empire, it did not specifically exemplify the influence and expansion of Arianism. The other options, however, have a more direct impact on the expansion of Arianism and the challenge it posed to orthodox Christianity during that time.
