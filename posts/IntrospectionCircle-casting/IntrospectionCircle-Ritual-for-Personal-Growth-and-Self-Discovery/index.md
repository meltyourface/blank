1. Purpose: The purpose of this IntrospectionCircle casting is to facilitate personal growth by revealing one's true desires and identifying potential areas for improvement or transformation.

2. Symbols and sigils: To align with the chosen purpose, the following symbols and sigils will be incorporated:

- The Eye of Insight: This symbol represents increased self-awareness, allowing the individual to deeply examine their thoughts, emotions, and motivations.
- The Sigil of Serenity: A symbol of inner peace and balance, helping to create a calm and focused state of mind for effective introspection.
- The Labyrinth: A symbol of the journey to self-discovery, representing the complex and ever-changing nature of personal growth and transformation.
- The Phoenix: This sigil signifies the process of shedding the old and embracing the new, symbolizing rebirth and renewal.

3. Circular pattern: The symbols and sigils will be arranged in a circle following the principles of sacred geometry. The Eye of Insight will be placed at the center, surrounded by the Labyrinth. The Sigil of Serenity and the Phoenix will be positioned opposite each other, creating a balanced flow of energy within the circle.

4. Ceremonial tools and materials:

- Candles: White candles to represent purity and clarity of thought, and purple candles to symbolize spiritual growth and transformation.
- Incense: Sage for spiritual cleansing and frankincense to heighten the senses and facilitate meditation.
- Altar: A clean surface located at the center of the circle to hold ritual items and serve as a focal point for the caster's meditation.
- Ritualistic attire: Comfortable, flowing garments in shades of white or purple to reinforce the themes of purity, clarity, and spiritual growth.

5. Ritual procedure:

1. Begin by preparing the ritual space, cleansing it with sage incense and setting up the altar with candles and other ritual items.
2. Dress in the ritualistic attire and enter a meditative state, focusing on the purpose of the ritual.
3. Inscribe or draw the selected symbols and sigils on the floor around the altar, following the circular pattern described earlier.
4. Light the candles in a clockwise sequence, invoking their associated energies as they are lit.
5. Recite the following chant while focusing on the Eye of Insight: "I summon the power of the Eye, the gateway to my inner self. Reveal to me the truth within, so I may grow and transform."
6. Walk the Labyrinth in a clockwise direction, reflecting on the symbolism of personal growth and self-discovery.
7. Kneel before the altar upon completing the Labyrinth circuit, meditating on the Sigil of Serenity and the Phoenix to embrace inner peace and rebirth.
8. Spend time in quiet contemplation, allowing personal revelations to surface and manifest.
9. When ready, close the ritual by extinguishing the candles in reverse order and thanking each symbol and sigil for their guidance.

6. Reflection: Once the ritual is complete, consider the revelations and insights gained during the process. Analyze how these personal discoveries align with the initial purpose of the IntrospectionCircle casting, as well as the impact and effectiveness of the ritual on your journey toward personal growth and self-awareness. Recording your thoughts in a journal is highly recommended for further reflection and integration of the experience.
