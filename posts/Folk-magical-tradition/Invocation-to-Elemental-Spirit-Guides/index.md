excerpt: > 
  Compose a powerful incantation, incorporating ancient symbols and mystical phrases, to summon and guide potent energies during a collaborative circle ceremony within the folk-magical tradition. Ensure that the chant resonates with the archetypal elements of earth, air, fire, and water, and integrates the energies of the practitioners' personal totems or spirit guides for heightened efficacy. In your creation, include rhythmic patterns, repetitive verses, and vivid imagery that invokes a deep connection to the ethereal realm and bolsters the synergistic power of the assembled participants.

By the four elements we stand,
In the sacred circle we expand.
With ancient sigils, runes and glyphs,
We gather to open the ethereal rifts.

As the winds blow, the fire ignites,
Earth stands strong and water unites,
Together we chant in rhythmic refrain,
Our spirit guides, we now call by name.

(Chorus)
Sylphs of the air, we summon thee,
Gnomes of earth, be here with we.
Salamanders of flame, heights we aspire,
Undines of water, let waves take us higher.

In the heart of creation, our spirits entwine,
Bound by the elements, as our voices align.
Raise the energies, let power increase,
Ancestral spirits, come forth, be released.

With feathers and fangs, to paws and to wings,
Our totem guides, to us they shall sing.
Bestow upon us mystical might,
As together we join in the circle tonight.

(Chorus)
Sylphs of the air, we summon thee,
Gnomes of earth, be here with we.
Salamanders of flame, heights we aspire,
Undines of water, let waves take us higher.

Through the veil we see and we listen,
From cosmic dimensions ancient wisdoms have risen.
Transformative powers, we call and combine,
To harness the energies, celestial design.

Chanting as one, now bonded we stand,
As the elements gather at our command.
We seal the connection, true and complete,
With harmony and unity, we feel the heartbeat.

(Chorus)
Sylphs of the air, we summon thee,
Gnomes of earth, be here with we.
Salamanders of flame, heights we aspire,
Undines of water, let waves take us higher.
