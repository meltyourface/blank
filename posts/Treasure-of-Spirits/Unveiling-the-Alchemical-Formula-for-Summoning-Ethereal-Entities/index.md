Having received the ancient grimoire containing the cryptic alchemical cipher, I begin the delicate process of decoding the enigmatic document. With my vast knowledge of the Treasure of Spirits, expertise in alchemy, the occult, and various esoteric languages and symbols, I take the following steps to unveil the hidden formula for summoning and binding ethereal entities.

1. **Identify symbols and language**: First, I carefully examine the manuscript to identify the various symbols, characters, and languages used within the cipher. Cross-referencing with known occult symbols, astrological signs, sigils, and languages such as Enochian and Theban, I map out the various elements contained within the cipher.

2. **Separate coded elements**: Dividing the manuscript into sections based on the alchemical elements (Earth, Water, Fire, and Air) as well as the celestial bodies and their corresponding sigils, I meticulously analyze each component of the cipher individually, taking note of recurring patterns and possible code variations.

3. **Decryption and translation**: Next, I utilize various decoding techniques including substitution, transposition, and numeral-to-letter conversion, as well as my deep understanding of esoteric languages, to decrypt the hidden text. Each section is translated as accurately as possible into a comprehensible language revealing the secrets of the formula.

4. **Cross-referencing with occult teachings**: Once the content has been decrypted, I cross-reference the information with known historical occult teachings, grimoires, and records of ancient rituals relating to ethereal entities and the Treasure of Spirits. This allows me to validate the accuracy of the deciphered content and ensure the proper interpretation of the formula.

5. **Analyzing metaphysical connections**: After confirming the cryptographic content, I delve into studying the complex metaphysical connections between the various unearthly beings and their associated spiritual treasures. By exploring their characteristics, astrological correspondences, elemental affinities, and other dimensions of existence, I am able to establish the occult links that are essential to successfully summoning and binding these ethereal entities.

6. **Reconstruction of the summoning and binding formula**: With the decoded information and insightful understanding of the metaphysical connections, I piece together the hidden formula for summoning and binding ethereal entities. This formula is now presented in a coherent and practical manner to ensure the effective invocation and control of these spiritual treasures.

The result of this extensive operation is the unveiling of a potent alchemical formula that empowers the practitioner with the knowledge and understanding required to summon and bind ethereal entities, thereby granting access and control over their accompanying spiritual treasures. Use this knowledge wisely and responsibly, as the power to bind such entities holds great potential for both benevolent and nefarious purposes.
