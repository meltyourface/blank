## The Afro-Levantine Serpent-Dragon

### I. Brief History

The Afro-Levantine serpent-dragon has its roots in the mythical, religious, and cultural traditions of the ancient African and Levantine civilizations, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Canaan. It is a complex synthesis of various serpent and dragon archetypes that appeared throughout the region as symbols of wisdom, transformation, and divine power. The serpent-dragon, sometimes depicted as a serpentine creature and other times as a more draconic beast, has undergone multiple iterations as it passed through generations and geographies, each culture adding to its rich mythology.

### II. Symbolism

A. **Wisdom**: The serpent-dragon is often associated with wisdom, brought about by its connection to the serpent, a symbol of knowledge and learning in many traditions. The dragons, in turn, are regarded as wise creatures that hoard information much like they hoard treasures.

B. **Transformation**: In various mythologies, the serpent represents transformation and rebirth as it sheds its skin to reveal a fresh, new one. The dragon signifies change on a grander scale as it can transform from a humble creature to a powerful, mystical force.

C. **Divine Power**: Both serpents and dragons throughout ancient cultures have been associated with gods and elements of creation. Their combined form, the serpent-dragon, represents the ultimate creative and destructive force, a symbol of the potent balance between chaos and order in the universe.

### III. Associated Rituals and Practices

A. **Invocations and Summonings**: Practitioners seeking to draw upon the power of the serpent-dragon often do so through invocations, meditations, and summonings in which the historical and mythological essence of the creature is communicated to the initiate.

B. **Sigils and Talismans**: The power of the serpent-dragon is said to be channeled through various symbols and designs, known as sigils and talismans. These symbols might be etched into tools, inscribed in sacred spaces, or tattooed onto the practitioner's skin.

C. **Astral Projection**: This practice allows initiates to explore non-physical realms, encounter other beings, and gain insights from the serpent-dragon by embarking upon spiritual journeys in the form of astral projection.

D. **Dream Work**: Similarly, some practitioners use dream work to access the wisdom and energies of the serpent-dragon, exploring unconscious realms, and seeking prophetic visions or insights during sleep.

### IV. Practical Guidance for Initiates

A. **Study**: To understand the mysteries of the serpent-dragon, initiates must begin by deepening their knowledge of the creature's history, symbolism, and associated rituals. They should explore the mythologies of the ancient cultures from which it emerged, such as those of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Canaan.

B. **Seek a Mentor**: Aspiring practitioners should seek out a seasoned mentor or teacher, one who has substantial experience in the esoteric arts and mysteries of the serpent-dragon. Through guidance, the initiate can learn rituals, practices, and knowledge that may not be available from written sources alone.

C. **Develop Psychic Awareness**: Cultivating one's psychic abilities is seen as a key to accessing the power and wisdom of the serpent-dragon. Initiates should practice meditation, visualization techniques, and cultivate their intuitive skills to utilize these supernatural gifts.

D. **Engage in Ritual Work**: As the initiate progresses in their study and understanding of the serpent-dragon, they should begin to practice rituals and exercises that call upon the creature's power. They may use invocations, sigils, or talismans suited to their goals and intentions in order to activate and channel the energies of the serpent-dragon.

By delving into the historical, mythological, and practical aspects of the Afro-Levantine serpent-dragon, initiates can develop a deeper understanding of this archetypal creature. Through diligent study and application, they may harness its extraordinary wisdom, transformational potential, and divine power to enrich their own spiritual journey.
