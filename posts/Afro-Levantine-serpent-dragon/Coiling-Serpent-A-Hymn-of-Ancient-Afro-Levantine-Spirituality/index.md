excerpt: Compose an intricate hymn dedicated to the Afro-Levantine serpent-dragon deities, specifically focusing on the revered Damballah Wedo and Marassa serpent gods. In crafting the hymn, utilize the ancient Afro-Levantine musical modes and complex time signatures inspired by the region's traditional rhythms. Be sure to include symbolic veiled references to the sacred Serpent Path and its connection to the forces of chaos and order. Additionally, incorporate a chorus that evokes the hypnotic coiling dance performed in devotion to the serpent-dragon deities during ceremonial rites. To enrich the hymn, use authentic instruments such as the oud, nay, and riq for an accurate representation of the Afro-Levantine musical heritage.

## Hymn of the Coiling Serpent

(Introduction - Instrumental)
[Oud, Nay, Riq play a haunting prelude marked by the Afro-Levantine mode]

Verse 1:
In the shadows of the sacred grove, the serpent stirs,
Damballah Wedo, enigmatic, divine slither,
Maria, Marassa, the serpent twins dance in the ether,
Weaving chaos and order, luminous mysteries unfurl.

(Chorus - Instrumental)
[Oud, nay, and riq come together, evoking the hypnotic coiling dance]

Verse 2:
Oh, serpentine deities who hold life within their embrace,
To the Serpent Path we wanderers are drawn,
Where veiled secrets are shrouded in whispers of wisdom and grace,
Transcending realms, unraveling the cosmic yarn.

(Chorus - Instrumental)
[Oud, nay, and riq emphasize the complex time signatures]

Verse 3:
Damballah Wedo, bearer of primordial Ã¦ther,
In thy sacred coils, the ancient allure, thy breath,
And Marassa, twin dancers, magnificent creatures,
Sway to the rhythms of life, gatekeepers of birth and death.

(Bridge)
[Oud and Nay play a mesmerizing interlude, connecting to the Serpent Path's essence]

Verse 4:
Through the sinuous Serpent Path, our souls aligned,
In the cosmic dance, chaos and order entwined,
Unearth secrets, fathomless depths, and unravel the divine,
To the Serpent's embrace, we devote our hearts and minds.

(Outro)
[Oud, nay, and riq conclude the hymn, echoing the ancient Afro-Levantine musical modes]
