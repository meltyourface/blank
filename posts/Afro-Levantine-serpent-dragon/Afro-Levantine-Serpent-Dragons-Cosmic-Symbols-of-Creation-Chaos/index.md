To accurately respond to this knowledge challenge, let's first establish a clear understanding of the Afro-Levantine serpent-dragon, a mythical creature featured prominently in the mythologies, spiritual practices, and cosmologies of various cultures and regions. The Afro-Levantine region refers to North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, encompassing the diverse civilizations that have interacted and influenced one another throughout history.

We will breakdown the answer into three sections: 

1. The roles and symbolism of serpent-dragons in ritual practices.
2. The roles and symbolism of serpent-dragons in creation myths and cosmology.
3. The reflection of the synthesis of cultural and spiritual influences in the Afro-Levantine regions brought about by the similarities and differences in these roles and symbolisms.

### Section 1: Serpent-dragons in Ritual Practices
Serpent-dragons play an important role in various ritual practices across the Afro-Levantine cultures. These rituals often involve the serpent-dragon as a symbol of power, wisdom, and transformation. In ancient Egyptian culture, for example, the serpent-dragon Apep represented evil and chaos, to be conquered by the solar deity Ra. Egyptian temple rituals often depicted the daily battle between Apep and Ra, symbolizing the struggle between order and chaos.

In the Levantine region, serpent-dragons often featured in fertility rituals involving agricultural rites and rain ceremonies. The Canaanite god Baal Hadad was associated with the serpent-dragon Lotan, who was defeated and slain by the god in a mythic battle. This conflict was enacted in fertility rites, with the slaying of the serpent-dragon symbolizing the victory of life and abundance over chaos.

### Section 2: Serpent-dragons in Creation Myths and Cosmology
In both Afro and Levantine creation myths, serpent-dragons typically represent primal cosmic forces, which play a dual role in the creation and destruction of the world. In ancient Egyptian mythology, the primordial serpent-dragon deity Nehebkau was closely linked to the creation of the universe. As a symbol of dualism, Nehebkau embodied the concept of eternal renewal and the cyclical nature of time.

Similarly, the cosmologies of Levantine cultures often featured serpent-dragons as key actors in the creation of the world. In Canaanite mythology, the aforementioned Lotan was a sea serpent-dragon associated with chaos that was vanquished by Baal Hadad, whose victory resulted in the establishment of order in the universe.

### Section 3: Reflection of Cultural and Spiritual Synthesis in the Afro-Levantine Region
The similarities and differences in the roles and symbolism of serpent-dragons across Afro-Levantine cultures reflect a complex layering of cultural and spiritual influences. These mythical creatures serve as powerful archetypes, reflecting shared human fears, aspirations, and the desire to understand the world around us.

One of the main similarities across these cultures is the association of serpent-dragons with both creativity and destruction. This dual nature represents the intertwined cosmic forces in the universe that are constantly interacting, shaping reality through an eternal process of creation and decay.

Another similarity is the presence of serpent-dragons in the aspects of ritual practices and cosmology. These creatures symbolize the link between the human and divine realms, playing a central role in mediating the complex relationships between people and the world of the gods.

However, the differences in the specific roles of serpent-dragons in the mythologies and rituals of the Afro-Levantine cultures illustrate the unique ways in which each society adapted these archetypes to reflect their own beliefs, experiences, and environmental circumstances.

In summary, the roles and symbolism of the Afro-Levantine serpent-dragon reveal a deep connection between the varied cultures of North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. They exemplify the synthesis of cultural and spiritual influences that have shaped the region's collective imagination, fostering a rich and diverse spiritual landscape marked by shared themes of cosmic dualism, order and chaos, and the never-ending cycle of creation and destruction.
