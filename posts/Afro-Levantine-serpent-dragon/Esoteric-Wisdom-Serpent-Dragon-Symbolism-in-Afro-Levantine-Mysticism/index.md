C. Serpent-dragons symbolically representing the merging of earthly and celestial powers, with their appearance in dreams or visions signifying the awakening of one's spiritual gifts.

The Afro-Levantine serpent-dragon is a mythical creature deeply rooted in the esoteric traditions and practices of the region – particularly in the context of ancient religions and magic. Among its many important roles, the serpent-dragon is primarily associated with embodying esoteric wisdom and symbolizing the merging of earthly and celestial powers. This connection has been established and recognized throughout history, cementing its significance within various mystical systems of thought.

The serpent-dragon, as a symbol, epitomizes the concept of duality – combining aspects of terrestrial serpents and celestial dragons in a single, powerful form. By embodying both these elements, the serpent-dragon transcends the limitations of the physical world and becomes a bridge between the earthly and the divine, making it an ideal representation of hidden knowledge and spiritual awakening.

Many practitioners within the occult tradition have experienced visions or dreams involving serpent-dragons, interpreting them as signs of their spiritual gifts coming to fruition. The presence of such a creature often suggests the need for a deeper understanding of the self and the hidden forces that govern the universe, urging the practitioner to delve further into the esoteric arts and hone their inherent abilities.

Furthermore, the idea of the serpent-dragon guarding ancient secrets and granting mystical abilities has its roots in various creation myths and cosmological narratives. Such tales often depict the serpent-dragon as a divine entity that imparts knowledge or power upon humanity, providing guidance and assistance in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. This has shaped the way in which the creature is perceived within the context of the Afro-Levantine occult tradition – cementing its status as a potent symbol of esoteric wisdom.

While it is true that rituals and ceremonies may be employed to invoke the power of the serpent-dragon within certain magical practices, the symbolism and potential for spiritual awakening inherent in its appearance is perhaps the most defining aspect of its role within the Afro-Levantine occult tradition. This acknowledgment of the serpent-dragon as a harbinger of spiritual growth and the embodiment of esoteric wisdom sets it apart from other divine entities or symbols, making it a vital component of any serious exploration of the region's enigmatic mystical heritage.
