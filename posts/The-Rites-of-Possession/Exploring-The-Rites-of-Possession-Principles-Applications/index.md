### I. Origins of The Rites of Possession

The Rites of Possession trace their roots back to ancient cultures and civilizations from around the world. These rites were practiced in various forms by shamans, priests, and adepts to communicate with spirits, invoke supernatural powers, and obtain knowledge beyond the realm of ordinary human understanding.

A. Key Influences

1. Ancient Egyptian magic played a significant role in shaping The Rites of Possession. Priests performed rituals to commune with the gods, seeking their aid, guidance, and knowledge.

2. Shamanic practices of indigenous tribes (such as Native Americans and Siberian tribes) employed The Rites of Possession to establish a connection with the spirit world, often for healing and divination purposes.

3. The European Grimoire tradition, stemming from medieval ceremonial magic, incorporated and expanded upon earlier traditions, highlighting the prominence of The Rites of Possession in diverse magical systems.

### II. Key Principles

A. Invocation and Evocation

1. Invocation: Calling upon a higher power or being (such as deities, angels, or spirits) and inviting their presence into the practitioner.

2. Evocation: Summoning spirits or entities external to the practitioner, often within a designated space (e.g., a circle or triangle).

B. The Importance of Ritual

1. Precise and detailed rituals are fundamental to successfully perform The Rites of Possession, as they create a stable and protected environment for the practitioner and the spirit/entity.

2. Common ritual elements include:
   - Casting a circle
   - Purification and consecration of tools and space
   - Use of specific incantations, symbols, and tools
   - Specific timing (e.g., lunar phases, planetary alignments)
