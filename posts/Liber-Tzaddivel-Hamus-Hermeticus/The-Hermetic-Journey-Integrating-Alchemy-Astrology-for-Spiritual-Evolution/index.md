In answering this knowledge challenge, it is essential to first establish a foundational understanding of Liber Tzaddivel Hamus Hermeticus, followed by an exploration of the key principles that drive the relationships between alchemy, astrology, and spiritual transformation.

Brief Background on Liber Tzaddivel Hamus Hermeticus:

Liber Tzaddivel Hamus Hermeticus, a fundamental treatise of Hermeticism, is an instructional dialogue between the mythical sage Hermes Trismegistus and his disciples. The text provides a comprehensive understanding of the integrated esoteric wisdom, including alchemy, astrology, and mystical teachings, that forms the backbone of the Hermetic tradition. Essentially, it is a collection of core principles, rituals, and secret knowledge that are aimed at illuminating a path to spiritual transformation.

Key Principles that Interconnect Alchemy, Astrology, and Spiritual Transformation:

1. The Principle of Correspondence - This principle, encapsulated by the axiom "As above, so below; as below, so above," emphasizes the microcosmic and macrocosmic similarities between the human experience and the cosmos. It links alchemy and astrology by highlighting the connection between the elements and planetary influences on the spiritual transformation process.

2. The Principle of Vibration - The understanding that all things in existence vibrate and resonate at their unique frequency, this principle connects the alchemical process, planetary energies, and individual's spiritual growth by illustrating the roles of specific vibratory frequencies in the quest for enlightenment.

3. The Principle of Polarity - Recognizing the existence of polar opposites or dualities in nature, this principle elucidates how alchemy pursues the union of opposites, while astrology examines the balance of planetary influences. Both disciplines reflect the duality inherent in spiritual transformation.

4. The Principle of Transformation - This principle posits that all things are in a constant state of transformation, from physical to spiritual. It ties alchemy's goal of transmuting base matter into the perfect substance, the Philosopher's Stone, with the individual process of spiritual enlightenment. Astrology contributes by revealing the planetary phases that influence transformation.

Stages of the Hermetic Journey to Enlightenment:

1. Preparation - The seeker begins their spiritual journey by cultivating a strong foundation in the study of esoteric subjects, meditation, and self-awareness. They dissect the principles and processes of alchemy and astrology, learning to transmute base desires into spiritual aspirations and understand their true nature under the influence of planetary forces.

2. Initiation - Upon gaining proficiency in esoteric knowledge, the seeker undergoes an initiation process that tests their mental, emotional, and spiritual resolve. The seeker learns to harness the power of alchemical symbols, rituals, and techniques, and to use astrological wisdom to enhance their understanding and mastery of spiritual transformation.

3. Purification - Similar to the alchemical process, the seeker's spiritual journey requires the purification of the soul, mind, and body. This stage entails self-reflection, meditation, and the expulsion of negative energies, inner conflicts, and blockages to create an inner space conducive to spiritual growth.

4. Illumination - The seeker begins to experience higher states of consciousness, gaining insights and wisdom from both alchemical practice and astrological knowledge. They transcend duality and experience a shift in perspective, observing the interconnected nature of all things.

5. Union - The ultimate stage of the journey, the seeker achieves unity with the divine, embracing the full potential of their spiritual and physical being. They become a living embodiment of the Hermetic wisdom, having successfully synthesized the principles of alchemy and astrology into their own spiritual transformation.

In conclusion, Liber Tzaddivel Hamus Hermeticus is an indispensable resource for understanding the profound and intricate relationships among alchemy, astrology, and spiritual transformation. The principles of correspondence, vibration, polarity, and transformation serve as the connective threads for these disciplines, enabling a seeker to synthesize these esoteric practices in their quest for enlightenment. By navigating the stages of preparation, initiation, purification, illumination, and union, a seeker adeptly incorporates the wisdom of alchemy and astrology in their journey to spiritual fulfillment.
