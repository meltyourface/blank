## I. Preparatory Rites & Sacred Space

A. Cleansing & Consecration of Sacred Space

1. Sweep the ritual area clean, ensuring that it is free from any debris or clutter.
2. Light the sacred flame on a consecrated altar, accompanied by an incense of frankincense and myrrh.
3. With a wand made of the olive branch, trace a clockwise circle around your ritual space, intoning:

"In nomine Yahweh, I consecrate this sacred space for the invocation of the divine presence of Archangel Raphael."

B. Aligning Auric Energies

1. Standing in the center of your sacred space, close your eyes and breathe deeply through your nose.
2. Visualize a sphere of brilliant white light descending from the heavens, encompassing and permeating your being, and re-aligning your energies to resonate with the celestial vibrations of Archangel Raphael.
3. Intone thrice:

"As I purify my thoughts, emotions, and intentions, I resonate with the divine healing of Archangel Raphael."

C. Opening of Elemental Gates

1. Utilizing the sacred knowledge of Liber Tzaddivel Hamus Hermeticus, inscribe the elemental symbols of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth into the four cardinal directions, aligned with the Zodiac and Tzaddi Wheel as follows: Fire to the East, Water to the West, Air to the South, and Earth to the North.
2. Recite the following invocations for each element:

"To the East, I call upon the Guardians of the Fiery Light to fuel the transformative power of healing."
"To the West, I summon the Guardians of the Sacred Waters to wash away all suffering and infirmity."
"To the South, I invoke the Guardians of the Pure Air to breathe vitality into the soul."
"To the North, I conjure the Guardians of the Earth's abundance, grounding in healing nourishment and strength."

3. Upon the speaking of each element, light an associated elemental candle and place it on the altar, arranged in a square.

### II. Celestial Summoning of Archangel Raphael

A. Invocation

In your ritual space, surrounded by the elemental powers and aligned with the planetary hour of Mercury, perform the following invocation to summon the celestial presence of Archangel Raphael:

"O luminous Raphael, divine healer, and compassionate messenger of Yahweh, I invoke thee in the sacred language of the ancient Hermetic mysteries, calling upon the celestial forces of mercy and healing love. In affliction, I seek thy holy presence to restore wholeness and vitality in mind, body, and spirit."

B. Invocation of Sacred Symbols

Utilizing the sacred knowledge of Liber Tzaddivel Hamus Hermeticus and a consecrated wand or athame, trace the sigil of Archangel Raphael in the air above your altar. As you do so, intone the following manifestation chant:

"RPŌʾAḆ, Archangel of the Divine Breath, Radiant Healer of the Sun, in sacred cadence, I call thee forth."

C. Alignment with Astrological Correspondences and Planetary Hours

1. Ensure that the invocation is performed during the planetary hour of Mercury, when its healing vibrations are most potent.
2. Align your ritual with the lunar phase, watching for the waxing moon when energies are building, amplifying the potency of your healing intentions.

D. Closing of Elemental Gates and Sacred Space

Once you feel the presence of Archangel Raphael and have humbly received the divine healing and restoration, encircle each elemental symbol counterclockwise, bidding farewell to the Guardians called upon earlier.

"In gratitude, I thank thee, Guardians of the Elements, for your protection, aiding in my healing and transformation. Farewell!"

To fully close the ritual and ceremonial space, once again trace the circle counterclockwise with the olive branch wand, intoning:

"In nomine Yahweh, I close this sacred space, keeping the healing light of Archangel Raphael within me, forevermore."

Blow out the elemental candles and give thanks for the blessings received in this powerful and transformative invocation.
