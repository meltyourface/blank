## Rite of the Velum Invocatus

Introduction:
The Rite of the Velum Invocatus is a modernized initiation rite designed for a candidate seeking entry into the Gradd y Gwyddon y Cylch (Grade of the Loremaster of the Circle). This rite combines mystic, esoteric, and occult traditions, weaving a tapestry of sacred knowledge, astral projection, ley line manipulation, and evocation of elemental forces while adhering to contemporary ethical and safety standards.

Preparation:
1. Select a location with a strong connection to ley lines and elemental energies, ideally an outdoor sacred grove or a stone circle.
2. Determine the optimal date and time of the ritual, preferably during a full moon or an astrological conjunction.
3. **Assemble the following ritual tools**: a ceremonial dagger, a wooden or stone bowl containing incense, a chalice of clear spring water, a candle in a secure holder, a crystal or other focus for ley line energy, and a circle-casting cord.

Creating the Sacred Space:
1. Cleanse the area using the incense, waving it around the entire space with a clear intention to purify the energy.
2. Mark out a physical circle using the cord, approximately 9 feet in diameter. Secure markers or small stones at each of the four cardinal points (north, south, east, and west).
3. Light the candle, invoking the element of fire, and place it within the circle's center.

Symbology:
Throughout the ritual, utilize the symbols of the Gradd y Gwyddon y Cylch, such as a spiral, a circle enclosing the four elemental symbols, and a glyph symbolizing the gateway between the astral and physical realms.

Opening Invocation:
Begin the ritual by invoking the four elements and asking for their guidance. **Face each cardinal direction as you chant**:

- East (Air): "Spirits of Air, we call upon your wisdom and clarity. Guide us on this rite of passage."
- South (Fire): "Spirits of Fire, we call upon your passion and transformation. Empower us throughout this journey."
- West (Water): "Spirits of Water, we call upon your intuition and healing. Guide us towards deeper understanding."
- North (Earth): "Spirits of Earth, we call upon your stability and grounding. Anchor us in your wisdom."

Astral Projection and Ley Line Manipulation:
1. The candidate should sit or lie down within the center of the circle, holding the focus crystal, and enter into a meditative state.
2. Guide the novice into astral projection, helping them visualize their astral body leaving their physical form.
3. Direct the astral traveler to connect with the surrounding ley lines using their focus crystal, feeling them vibrate and align with the Earth's energy.

Evocation of Elemental Forces:
1. The candidate, still in their astral form, is instructed to bring forth the elemental energies from the Earth and imbue themselves with those essences, using their crystal as a conduit.
2. As each element is absorbed, the candidate should chant:

"By the thriving life of Earth, I am reborn."
"By the flowing grace of Water, I am cleansed."
"By the raging power of Fire, I am transformed."
"By the whispering wisdom of Air, I am awakened."

Returning and Completion:
1. Once fully infused with elemental energies, the candidate returns to their physical body, allowing the energies to materialize within.
2. Stand, releasing the invoked elemental spirits with gratitude, and declare:

"Through the trials and blessings of the elements, I now stand before you as a Loremaster of the Circle. I accept my destiny and my sacred power, carrying it with wisdom and responsibility."

3. Extinguish the candle, signaling the ritual's end.
4. Dismantle the circle, removing the markers or stones and releasing the ley line energy.

Through these steps, the novice will have immersed themselves in the experience, emerging as a member of the Gradd y Gwyddon y Cylch.
