To answer this knowledge challenge, we need to consider the different aspects and roles of Helios in each of the mentioned mythologies and traditions. First, let's explore the roles of Helios in both Greek and Roman mythologies, followed by an analysis of the Hermetic and Neoplatonic traditions. Finally, we will examine how all these perspectives contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Helios within occultism and esotericism. 

1. **Role of Helios in Greek Mythology**:

Helios is the ancient Greek Sun god who personifies the sun and its life-giving warmth. He is one of the Titans, the older generation of gods preceding the Olympians. Helios' primary function within Greek mythology is that of a solar deity, responsible for bringing light and warmth to the Earth. In this capacity, Helios drives his golden chariot across the sky each day, bringing the sun's rays to Earth.

Some of the iconic narratives revolving around Helios include his involvement in the tale of Phaethon, who perished attempting to control Helios' chariot, and his witness to the abduction of Persephone by Hades. Helios was often associated with powerful symbols like the halo, the solar disk, and the eyes of the gods, suggesting he was a key figure in ancient Greek religion.

2. **Role of Helios in Roman Mythology**:

The Romans identified Helios with their own sun god, Sol Invictus, or the "Unvanquished Sun." Sol Invictus held an important position within the Roman pantheon and was venerated as a patron of the military and guardian of emperors.

In contrast to the Greek view of Helios as a chariot-driving god, Sol Invictus was depicted riding a quadriga, a four-horse chariot, representing the sun's triumphal journey across the sky. The cult of Sol Invictus became increasingly important, culminating in the establishment of the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (Birthday of the Unvanquished Sun) on December 25, which later became Christmas.

3. **Incorporation and expansion of Helios in Hermetic and Neoplatonic traditions**:

The Hermetic tradition drew heavily from Greek and Egyptian mythologies, combining the symbols and stories surrounding Helios with other solar deities like the Egyptian Ra. In this tradition, Helios was seen as the source of divine illumination and gnosis. It was believed that through the light of the sun, humanity could connect with the divine and access deep spiritual wisdom.

Similarly, the Neoplatonic tradition treated Helios as an essential source of divine light, considering him a representation of the One or the Monad, the ultimate reality from which all things emanate. Plotinus, a prominent Neoplatonic philosopher, described the sun as the visible representation of the Good, the source of all intellectual light, and the spiritual sun that guides human souls toward fulfillment.

4. **Comprehensive understanding of Helios within occultism and esotericism**:

These varied perspectives on Helios converge to present a rich and multi-faceted understanding of the Sun god that has deeply informed occult and esoteric thought. Beyond being a mere personification of the sun in Greek and Roman mythologies, Helios has come to represent the spiritual power that animates the universe, from the cosmic order to the inner light of divine wisdom.

As such, adepts of the Hermetic and Neoplatonic traditions ascribe to Helios both literal and symbolic meanings, invoking him as a deity, a spiritual intermediary, and the source of divine illumination. Thus, Helios is not just a radiant figure in ancient stories but a potent archetype of spiritual transformation and enlightenment.

In conclusion, Helios has evolved from his roles in Greek and Roman mythologies as a sun god and symbol of triumph to a more nuanced and complex figure within the Hermetic and Neoplatonic traditions. Through the fusion of these varied perspectives and the expansion of Helios's role as a symbol of divine wisdom, light, and spiritual illumination, the figure of Helios has gained an essential and enduring position within the realms of occultism and esotericism.
