O Grand Architect of the Universe,

We gather under the canopy of Thy wisdom,
To embrace the Esoteric Christian order of Woodwose,
As humble seekers of truth and divine knowledge,
We stand before Thee at the threshold of sacred initiation.

In the sacred geometry of Thy creation,
We find the harmonious blueprint of existence,
Inscribed within the Flower of Life, the Seed of Truth,
Guiding us to fathom the intricate patterns of Thy plan.

We call upon the four guardians of the elements,
To sanctify and empower this sacred ground,
Forming the base, the square, the cornerstone,
As professed in the Book of the Revelations, 21:16.

From the celestial vault of heaven,
We beseech Thee, O mighty Tetragrammaton,
Bequeath upon us the signs and tokens,
That we may decipher the hidden wisdom of Thy words.

In the footsteps of Yeshua, the Christ, our Master,
We trace the path of love, mercy, and sacrifice,
In the Gospel of John, 15:13, a truth revealed,
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."

Cloaked in the verdant foliage of the Woodwose,
We embrace the virgin spirit of the untamed wild,
Finding solace in the whispers of the forest,
Opening our hearts to the ancient pulse of creation.

O Spiritus Sancti, consume us with Thy divine fire,
Transform us into living vessels, filled with Thy essence,
Like the mystic phoenix, arising from the ashes,
We are reborn into the sacred fraternity of the Woodwose.

Through the paths of Kabbalah, Gnosticism, and Hermeticism,
We seek the fusion of the divine and human spirits,
In communion with the seraphic choirs and angelic hosts,
Joining the eternal dance of the celestial spheres.

May the All-Seeing Eye watch over us,
As we travel the winding roads of life's journey,
Enlighten our minds, fortify our souls, and purify our hearts,
So we may ascend the spiritual ladder towards Thy radiant glory.

In the hallowed name of the Alpha and Omega,
The First and the Last, the Beginning and the End,
We consecrate our commitment to the sacred vows of the Woodwose,
Bound by love, wisdom, and eternal hope.

Amen.
