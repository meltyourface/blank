## Celestial Naming Ceremony for the Starborn

Preparation:
1. Obtain the newborn's astrological chart, including information on the positions of planets at the time of birth.
2. Research the etymological roots and mystical significance of the chosen name.
3. Collect the following materials - a large circular cloth mat, corresponding colored candles for each planet, planetary sigils drawn on individual paper, an incense holder for each element (earth, air, water, fire), an easel or stand for a piece of art to be created during the ceremony, and any additional materials that resonate with the newborn's astrological chart.

Ceremony Structure:

1. Purification: Cleanse the room and ritual participants with a purifying incense or smudging practice using sage or palo santo, while reciting an invocation to the four elements.

2. Celestial Circle: Arrange the circular cloth mat in the center of the space to represent the heavens. Place the colored candles in positions correlating to the newborn's astrological chart, and place the corresponding sigils near each candle. Place the incense holders for each element (earth, air, water, fire) in the appropriate cardinal directions around the circle's perimeter.

3. Planetary Invocations: Beginning with the candle representing the planet ruling the newborn's sun sign, sequentially light each candle while invoking the energy of that planet. Recite a verse or phrase highlighting the newborn's potential strengths or gifts based on the planet's influence. For example, "Oh mighty Mars, grant this child courage and passion in their pursuits. May they use their warrior spirit to overcome adversity with grace and determination."

4. Artistic Creation: As the candles burn, commence work on a piece of art that symbolizes the newborn's celestial energies. This may be a painting, sculpture, or other artwork containing symbols and colors associated with the selected name's etymology and significance. This creative act calls upon the creative forces of the cosmos to imbue meaning and power into the chosen name.

5. Naming Invocation: Once the candles have burned down and the artwork is complete, gather the participants around the celestial circle to bear witness to the naming. In a strong and clear voice, state the chosen name and its mystical significance, followed by an affirmation of the child's future under the guidance of the celestial energies. For example, "We call upon the child, Aurora, whose name is born of light and dawn, to bring illumination and hope wherever they may go. May the cosmic forces present here today guide and protect her as she journeys through life."

6. Closing the Circle: Thank the planetary energies for their presence and contributions to the ceremony, encouraging their continued support and protection for the newborn. Extinguish any remaining candles and smudge the room once more to release the energies and set the intention for the child's life.

Post-Ceremony:
- Present the completed art piece to the family as a keepsake and a reminder of the energetic forces that will forever guide their child.
- Store the sigil-infused candle remains in a safe space to maintain a connection to the celestial energies and further empower the chosen name.
