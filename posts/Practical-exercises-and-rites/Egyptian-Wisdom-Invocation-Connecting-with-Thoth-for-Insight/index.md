For this ritual, I will choose the Egyptian deity Thoth, the god of knowledge, wisdom, and writing.

1. **Chosen deity**: Thoth

2. Lore, symbolism, and offerings: Thoth is often depicted with the head of an ibis and is associated with the moon and crescent. He is credited with inventing the art of writing, and ancient Egyptians would invoke Thoth for help in understanding sacred texts. Offerings to Thoth include papyrus, ink, and quill, as well as herbs like sandalwood and frankincense.

3. **Altar setup**: Set up an altar with a Thoth statue or image, a small dish of sandalwood or frankincense, and a chalice, athame, wand, and pentacle. Place a papyrus scroll, ink, and quill on the altar, along with a moonstone or clear quartz crystal.

4. **Intention**: The intention of this ritual is to develop a closer connection with Thoth and seek his guidance in obtaining wisdom and understanding in matters of esoteric knowledge.

5. **Incantation**: "O Thoth, wise and ancient god, hear my call this sacred night. Grant me insight, wisdom, and truth, as I seek your counsel and light."

6. **Symbolic actions and practical exercises**: Draw Thoth's sigil on the papyrus using the ink and quill. Light the sandalwood or frankincense incense as an offering. Perform prostrations before the altar as a sign of respect and devotion to Thoth.

7. **Grounding and centering**: Before the ritual, meditate on an image of Thoth, focusing on his ibis head and crescent moon symbol. Visualize these symbols grounding and centering your energy, preparing you for the invocation.

8. **Opening the ritual**: Begin by casting a circle, invoking the elements, and calling upon your spirit guides or guardians. Declare your intention to invoke Thoth and open the circle to his energy.

9. **Invoking Thoth**: Standing before the altar, recite the incantation and perform the practical exercises listed above. Continue to chant and focus on your intention, inviting Thoth's energy into your sacred space.

10. **Closing the ritual**: Once you feel the presence of Thoth's energy, express your gratitude for his guidance and assistance. Close the circle, release Thoth's energy, and thank the elements and your guiding spirits for their participation. Ground any excess energy by visualizing it flowing back into the earth.

11. **After-ritual care**: Dispose of the sandalwood or frankincense by burying it respectfully. Cleanse your ritual tools with saltwater and sage smoke. Journal about your ritual experiences, noting any insights or messages received from Thoth. Reflect on the wisdom and understanding you've gained, and consider how to apply it to your spiritual journey.
