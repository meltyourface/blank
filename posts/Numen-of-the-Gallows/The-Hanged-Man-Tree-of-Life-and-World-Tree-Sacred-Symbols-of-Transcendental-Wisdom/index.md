In tackling this knowledge challenge, we must first dissect the three primary symbols of focus: the hanged man, the tree of life, and the world tree, and explore their individual meanings, before delving into their profound interconnectedness in facilitating a journey towards transcendental wisdom in the context of the esoteric Numen of the Gallows.

The Hanged Man, an archetype widely recognized in various mythologies and tarot interpretations, symbolizes self-sacrifice, surrender, a suspension of conventional thought, and for the sake of acquiring a higher state of consciousness or wisdom. The act of hanging upside down can be perceived as a transformative experience – inverting one's reality, both physically and symbolically, to gain insights that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

In Norse Mythology, Odin's self-inflicted hanging on the world tree, Yggdrasil, is of key importance when discussing the hanged man. His purpose was to undergo a sacrificial initiation in which he pierced his side with his own spear to acquire the secrets of the runes – a symbol system believed to hold immense esoteric power.

Now let us turn our attention to the Tree of Life. Depicted in various traditions, including Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism, the Tree of Life is a divine and cosmic symbol that represents the spiritual path to enlightenment, the interconnectedness of all things, and the process of creation in a hierarchical structure composed of Sephiroth or spheres representing different aspects of creation and power. Navigating the pathways between these spheres can both teach and reveal karmic, moral, and metaphysical truths.

Lastly, we consider the World Tree as a universal symbol found throughout numerous cultures, including Norse, Native American, and Hindu belief systems. It is often depicted as a colossal tree whose roots penetrate the earth's depths and whose branches stretch to the heavens, bridging all realms of existence and connecting the celestial, terrestrial, and underworld spheres. Functioning as an axis mundi, the World Tree anchors the universe and provides a link between the human experience and the divine, guiding those who seek wisdom and spiritual transcendence.

With these three symbols in mind, we can now examine the relationship between the Hanged Man, Tree of Life, and World Tree in relation to the Numen of the Gallows. In this context, the numen signifies a pivotal moment of transformation, an experience of suspended reality where one can access insights from the depths of the subconscious mind or the spiritual plane.

The strong link between the hanged man and both the Tree of Life and the World Tree lies in the transformative energies they embody – self-sacrifice, truth-finding, and spiritual ascent. In this journey, the Hanged Man serves as the seeker, the one who willingly experiences a change in perspective and challenges conventional wisdom in pursuit of higher knowledge.

Both the Tree of Life and the World Tree act as facilitators and dwelling places for the transformative power of sacrifice and gaining transcendental wisdom. They offer paths, energy channels, and links between the terrestrial and celestial realms that the seeker can tap into and navigate for exploration and growth – the act of ascension on the Tree of Life or Yggdrasil symbolizes the spiritual rise from the mundane to the divine.

In conclusion, the interconnectedness of the Hanged Man, Tree of Life, and World Tree in the context of the Numen of the Gallows represents a profound understanding of the transformative power of self-sacrifice, the pursuit of wisdom, and the relationship between the human experience and the divine. By engaging with and navigating these symbols, one can access the transcendental wisdom available to those willing to invert their reality and surrender to the potential of the esoteric realms beyond ordinary perception.
