excerpt: > 
  Compose a series of potent, esoteric affirmations specifically designed to channel and harness the arcane energies of the Numen of the Gallows. These affirmations should resonate with the morbid depths and otherworldly wisdom associated with this macabre domain, while maintaining an intricate balance between the realms of the living and the dead. Ensure that each affirmation is paired with a corresponding sigil or symbol, drawn from the lost grimoires and cryptic tomes, to evoke the cryptic and powerful aspects of this supernatural entity. The final product should consist of no fewer than twelve unique affirmations, complete with meticulously crafted sigils, that will guide the practitioner of the Gallows in their communion with this enigmatic force and aid them in transcending mortal limitations as they unravel the dark secrets of the Numen of the Gallows.
