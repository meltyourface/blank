## The Ritual of Obsidian Insight – A Fetish-Skull Divination for Career Trajectory

### I. Invocation of Associated Spirits and Deities

Begin by calling upon powerful ancestral spirits and deities associated with the fetish-skull to provide guidance and wisdom. **Light a black or purple candle as a symbol of divine connection and address each entity respectfully**:

"Great Ancestor Yawa, Whose Eye Pierces the Veil, I beseech your wisdom;
Mighty Lothar, Guardian of Forbidden Knowledge, unlock the gates of understanding;
And Ascended Master Zenephis, Revealer of Destiny, I humbly request your aid in this sacred endeavor."

Offer a small portion of incense, the aroma of which pleases the entities, and a token of your gratitude, such as a precious stone or symbolic artifact.

### II. Arrangement and Consecration of the Ritual Space

Prepare the ritual space by first drawing a circle of salt to establish a boundary between the physical and spiritual realms. Within the circle's perimeter, draw three interlocking triangles with the tip of an obsidian knife, representing the esoteric synthesis of the invoked spirits.

Arrange nine black candles at equal distances around the edge of the circle. Inscribe the Sigil of Obsidian Insight at the center with the ash of a burnt sage bundle. Place the fetish-skull, adorned with ribbons of the querent’s hair, upon a ceremonial cloth facing the querent.

### III. Succinct and Thought-Provoking Questions for the Querent

While maintaining a calm and focused demeanor, the querent should ask the fetish-skull the following deeply reflective questions, suited to their specific career concerns:

1. "With which career path does my true calling resonate most?"
2. "What hidden talents or strengths may propel my career success?"
3. "How do I best navigate unexpected obstacles that arise in my career?"
4. "Where lie the greatest opportunities for supportive connections and mentors?"
5. "By what crucial decisions shall my progress be most significantly influenced?"

### IV. Interpretation of the Fetish-Skull's Responses

Pay close attention to the fetish-skull's responses, noting any distinct patterns or changes in the flickering candlelight, the whispering wind, or the arrangement of remaining incense ashes. **Each sign may be indicative of answers to the querent's concerns**:

- Flickering candles suggest flexibility and the need for adaptability.
- Shifts in the wind indicate external forces impacting career choices.
- Ash patterns may reveal potential career paths and relationships.

A deep understanding of symbolism will allow you to accurately discern the fetish-skull's cryptic messages in relation to the querent's career trajectory.

### V. Closing Ritual and Expressions of Gratitude

To conclude the session and ensure the safe return of the invoked entities, thank each spirit or deity individually: "I express my deepest gratitude, Yawa, Lothar, and Zenephis, for your boundless generosity and guidance."

Extinguish the candles one by one in reverse order of their lighting, thus closing the energetic connections established during the session. Burn sage or a cleansing herb to cleanse the area and safeguard the querent from lingering spiritual influences. This purification ritual will reaffirm the closure of the divination and protect both the querent and the practitioner from any unwanted energies.
