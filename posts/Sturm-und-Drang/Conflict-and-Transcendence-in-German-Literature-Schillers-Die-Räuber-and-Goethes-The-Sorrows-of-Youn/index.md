Introduction:
To address the knowledge challenge, we must first understand the historical and cultural context of the two works in question. Friedrich Schiller's "Die Räuber" (The Robbers) and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" are two of the most influential literary works from the Sturm und Drang period in German literature. This movement emerged in the late 18th century as a reaction against the rationalism of Enlightenment thought, emphasizing emotional intensity, passion, and individualism in contrast to reason and social conformity.

Now, with this contextual background, let's analyze the two works, focusing on the protagonists' conflict between individualism and societal norms, the relationship between metaphysical philosophy and emotional intensity, and the impact of the sublime on human actions.

Conflict Between Individualism and Societal Norms:

In "Die Räuber," the protagonist Karl Moor grapples with the tension between his personal desires and the expectations of society. Born to a noble family, he is torn between following in his father's footsteps and pursuing a life of adventure with a band of robbers. As a result, Karl resists the boundaries set by his social status, choosing instead the path of an outlaw.

In "The Sorrows of Young Werther," the eponymous protagonist, Werther, faces a similar struggle. In love with the charming and virtuous Lotte, Werther's intense emotions are at odds with the societal constraints of marriage and propriety. As Lotte is already engaged to another man, Werther's passion drives him to suffer emotional turmoil and ultimately leads to his self-inflicted tragic demise.

Relationship Between Metaphysical Philosophy and Emotional Intensity:

Both works critique the rationalism of the Enlightenment, embracing a metaphysical approach that foregrounds human emotions. In "Die Räuber," Karl seeks to defy the physical, social, and moral boundaries imposed upon him, engrossed in a vision of boundless freedom. This grandiosity reflects the broader aspiration of Sturm und Drang, which upholds emotional intensity and the yearning for transcendence.

Similarly, "The Sorrows of Young Werther" emphasizes the incredible power of individual emotions over reason and other external factors. Werther's deeply felt but unrequited love for Lotte propels him into a profound existential crisis, questioning the meaning and value of life. In both cases, a metaphysical perspective allows these protagonists to explore their desires, passions and search for identity decisively rejecting the Enlightenment's reliance on reason.

Impact of the Sublime on Human Actions:

The concept of the sublime, characterized by awe, grandeur, and vastness, is an essential theme of the Sturm und Drang movement. In "Die Räuber," Karl's desire for freedom and rebellion against social norms is expressed in the sublime landscape, which symbolizes the unbounded potential of the human spirit. Driven by these sublime emotions, Karl takes radical actions, like establishing a group of robbers to defy the established order.

In "The Sorrows of Young Werther," the sublime manifests in Werther's passionate and all-consuming love for Lotte. His feelings elevate the mundane existence to an exalted, transcendent realm, blurring the boundaries between life and death, happiness and suffering. As Werther emotionally renders himself unable to reconcile his love with reality, the sublime drives him to the tragic act of suicide.

Conclusion:

In both Schiller's "Die Räuber" and Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther," we observe similar themes and concerns of the Sturm und Drang period: the tension between individualism and societal norms, the interconnectivity of metaphysical philosophy and emotional intensity, and the impact of the sublime on human actions. These works affirm the importance and primacy of emotions, the striving for transcendence, and the inescapable influence of the sublime on human behavior and decisions. By delving into these quintessential literary pieces, we gain a more profound understanding of the broader aspirations and criticisms presented by the Sturm und Drang movement.
