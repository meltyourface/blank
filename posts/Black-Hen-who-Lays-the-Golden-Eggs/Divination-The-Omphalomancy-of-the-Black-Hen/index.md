Introducing the Omphalomancy of the Black Hen: A Unique Divination System

The Omphalomancy of the Black Hen is a unique divination system steeped in the enigmatic lore of the Black Hen who Lays the Golden Eggs. Drawing upon the mystical hen's specific attributes and behaviors, this practice offers a rich and complex tool for discerning messages from the occult realm.

Attributes of the Black Hen
1. **Black color**: The Black Hen's color symbolizes the void from which creation emerged, and signifies mystery, hidden potential, and transformation.
2. **Egg-laying abilities**: The Golden Eggs denote wealth, abundance, and prosperity, echoing the cycle of life and rebirth.
3. **Occult associations**: The Black Hen is linked to magic, alchemy, and divine knowledge.

The divination process is composed of several steps that incorporate the Black Hen's movements, behavior, and egg-laying abilities.
**Step 1**: Preparation
- Find a sacred space where practitioners can remain undisturbed.
- Arrange an altar replete with feathers, eggshells, and other representations of the Black Hen.
- Light a black candle dedicated to the hen's transformative nature.
- Release the Black Hen into the sacred space.
**Step 2**: The Question
- Formulate a question, focusing on the matter while observing the hen's actions.
- Write the question on a piece of parchment infused with magical intent.
**Step 3**: The Divination
- Track the Black Hen's movements throughout the space, taking note of any patterns, sudden stops, or changes in direction.
- Observe the hen's behavior: like a vigilant gaze (attention to detail), grooming (self-care), pecking the ground (unearthing hidden truths), or ruffling its feathers (agitation or inner turmoil).
- Remain attentive to the egg-laying process: the number of Golden Eggs laid and locations where they are laid.
**Step 4**: Interpretation
- Utilize a set of interpretative guidelines to decipher the hen's messages:
  1. **Movements**: clockwise (positive outcomes, growth, good fortune); counterclockwise (negative outcomes, stagnation, loss); zigzag (indecision, confusion, mixed blessings).
  2. **Behavior**: vigilant gaze (heed caution, pay close attention); grooming (self-reflection, reassessment); pecking the ground (dig deeper, hidden meanings); ruffling feathers (external influences causing unrest, self-discovery).
  3. **Eggs**: one (new beginnings, creation); two (balance, partnership); three (growth, expansion); four (stability, groundwork); five (change, transformation); more than five (abundance, overflowing potential).
**Step 5**: Validation and Gratitude
- Validate the divination by comparing the responses of the Black Hen with personal experiences, trusting intuition and inner guidance.
- Once the session is complete, express gratitude to the Black Hen and to the presiding forces that contributed to the divination.
