## The Rite of the Veiled Mirror

**Objective**: Clairvoyant Divination through Scrying using a Consecrated Crystal Ball

Ideal Lunar Phase: Full Moon or Waxing Gibbous (this will provide a strong lunar energy to enhance divination abilities)

Ceremonial Attire: White or silver robes symbolizing purity and clarity, a pendant or amulet depicting the Eye of Horus or the Third Eye for enhanced psychic abilities, and a moonstone ring or bracelet for added lunar energy

Ritual Preparation:

1. Cleanse the ritual space by burning sage or palo santo.
2. **Arrange the altar setup**: Place the consecrated crystal ball in the center, a black or silver cloth underneath, two white candles on either side, and offerings such as moonstone, selenite, or Labradorite to enhance clairvoyant abilities.
3. Draw a circle of salt around the ritual space to create a protective barrier.
4. Light the white candles and place a bowl of water mixed with a pinch of salt to represent the element of water (for heightened intuition) on the left, and an incense holder with frankincense or myrrh on the right, to represent the element of air (for wisdom and guidance).

Invocation of the Guardian Entity:

5. Stand before the altar and close your eyes. Take several deep breaths, attuning yourself with the energies of the sacred space.
6. **Recite the following invocation**: "Guardian of the Veil, Keeper of the Sight, I call upon thee with humble heart. Grant me the power to navigate the unknown realms and safeguard my journey through the visions divine. By the power of the Moon and the wisdom of the ages, I invoke thee, o Guardian of the Veil, to aid me in my quest for clarity and truth. Blessed be."

Sacred Incantations and Scrying:

7. With eyes closed, chant the following incantation while gently running your hands over the crystal ball: "By Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and the Light of the Silver Moon, may the visions hidden within the Veiled Mirror be revealed unto me."
8. Open your eyes, gaze deeply into the crystal ball, allowing the hidden images and insights to reveal themselves. Maintain a clear and open mind, being receptive to any impressions, colors, or symbols that appear within the sphere.
9. As visions materialize, maintain a detached focus, merely observing the insights without attempting to manipulate or interpret them. Jot down any revealed symbols, feelings, or images for later analysis.

Enhancing Visualization and Interpretation:

10. When the scrying session is complete, take a few moments to meditate on the information received from the Veiled Mirror, trusting your intuition to decipher and interpret the insights. Journal any newfound understanding or clarity.

Safeguards and Energy Balancing:

11. **Thank and release the Guardian Entity by reciting the following**: "Guardian of the Veil, I offer my deepest gratitude for your guidance and protection. As I close this rite, I bid thee farewell. Blessed be."
12. **Ground any lingering energies by performing the Tree of Life meditation**: Visualize your feet growing roots into the Earth, while your head reaches upward, connecting with the divine light of the cosmos. Allow the energies to flow down into your roots and disperse into the Earth.
13. Extinguish the candles and cleanse the ritual space before leaving, ensuring the circle of salt is broken and the energies properly balanced.

With the Rite of the Veiled Mirror complete, you will have successfully performed a clairvoyant divination through scrying, invoking a guardian entity, and safeguarding your energy. Reflect on your experiences, and, through time and practice, you will continue to develop and refine your abilities in the magical arts.
