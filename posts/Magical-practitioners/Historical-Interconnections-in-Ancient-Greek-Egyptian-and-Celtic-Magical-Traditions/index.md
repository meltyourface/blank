  In answering this knowledge challenge, we must heed several key aspects: the histories and characteristics of various magical traditions, the interconnections between them, the adaptations and resurgences of specific practices and theories, and the underlying similarities across these diverse approaches. By exploring these elements, we can appreciate the vastness and intricacy of occultism as a whole.
  
  To begin, let us briefly outline the magical traditions attributed to the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Celts. The Ancient Greeks practiced various forms of magic, including divination, necromancy, and theurgy. One of the prime examples of Greek magical practice is the Eleusinian Mysteries, a series of initiation ceremonies that held immense significance in the understanding of life, death, and the afterlife. 
  
  Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians were deeply invested in magical practices embedded in their daily lives and intertwined with their religious beliefs. Their practices encompassed various rituals, amulets, and spells, with a focus on harnessing divine energy and maintaining the cosmic order. One of the most famous Egyptian magical texts, the Book of the Dead, offers a guide to the afterlife, highlighting the pivotal role of magic in their perception of existence.
  
  The Celts, on the other hand, are known for their intricate system of animistic and polytheistic beliefs and the presence of Druids who were priests, seers, and sages. These enigmatic figures heavily influenced Celtic magical practices, which included divination, shape-shifting, and the worship of both nature and ancestral spirits.
  
  Now that we have a general understanding of these distinct traditions, let us explore their interconnections and influences among each other. There is considerable evidence that these magical paradigms impacted one another, as trade, migration, and communication unfolded across various societies throughout history. For instance, following Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt, Greek and Egyptian magical beliefs and practices merged, creating an amalgamation exemplified by the cult of Isis and Serapis. Similarly, the Roman conquest of the Celtic world allowed certain Celtic traditions and deities to assimilate and coexist with Roman religious practices.
  
  The sharing, adaptation, and resurgence of specific practical and theoretical approaches across these traditions can be observed in several instances. For example, the Eleusinian Mysteries and Egyptian initiation rites both involve a symbolic death and rebirth, representing the initiate's transformation and entrance into a mystical fraternity. Additionally, the idea of divine kingship, as visible in the Pharaoh of ancient Egypt and the sacral kingship of Celtic societies, portrays a shared understanding of the ruler as the bridge between the human and divine realms.
  
  By examining these complex interconnections, we can identify profound similarities amidst ostensible differences within the ever-evolving realm of occultism. These similarities often stem from archetypal concepts and symbolism, such as the notion of the dying and resurrecting god, the cosmic serpent, or the mother goddess figure. Regardless of cultural differences, these universal themes serve to connect diverse magical practices, offering profound insights into the human experience and our quest for spiritual knowledge.
  
  In summary, the development and progression of various magical traditions, such as those attributed to the Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Celts, are interconnected and entwined in a myriad of ways. By analyzing the sharing, adaptation, and resurgence of specific practical and theoretical approaches over time, we can uncover profound similarities within this ever-evolving realm of occultism. Recognizing these underlying connections deepens our comprehension of the rich tapestry and complexity of magical practices and beliefs throughout history.
