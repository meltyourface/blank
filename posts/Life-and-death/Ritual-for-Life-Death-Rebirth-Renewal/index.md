## Rite of the Eternal Cycle

### I. **Setting**:

The ceremony will take place within a consecrated space, either in a natural setting such as a forest clearing or a cave or in a temple resembling the ancient architecture of Aztec or Egyptian civilizations. The area should be adorned with representations of deities related to life, death, and rebirth, such as Osiris and Isis in Egyptian mythology or Xipe Totec and Quetzalcoatl in Aztec mythology. The overall atmosphere should evoke solemnity and reverence to facilitate introspection.

### II. **Symbolic Objects and Elements**:

1. **Fire**: Represents the life force energy and the warmth of the living world. Flames will be used for illumination, emphasizing the guiding power of fire through the darkness.
2. **Water**: Represents purification, the flow of life, and connectivity between all living beings. Water will be used to cleanse participants and symbolize the cleansing of their soul from past burdens.
3. **Earth**: Represents stability, growth, and the foundation upon which life builds. Soil or sand will be used to symbolize participants' connection to the Earth and the inevitability of returning to it.
4. **A sacrificial offering**: Represents the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth. An ethical offering, such as fruits or flowers, will be presented as an acknowledgment of life's temporariness.

### III. **Incantations and Chants**:

1. **Chant of Encompassing Duality**: A chant reflecting the necessity of both life and death for the existence of the other. Through this chant, participants recognize the interplay of the two energies and the ultimate balance they bring to the universe.
2. **Invocation of the Elements**: A prayer designed to evoke the presence and power of fire, water, and earth. Participants recite the invocation together, inviting the elements to assist in their transformation.
3. **The Journey**: A series of mantras reflecting on personal experiences, triumphs, and regrets. This segment encourages introspection and the expression of personal truths.
4. **Hymn of Rebirth**: A soaring, triumphant chorus celebrating the conclusion of the rite and the participants' rebirth. This chant instills a deep sense of renewal and connection to the eternal cycle.

### IV. **Interactions and Performances**:

1. Participants cleanse themselves using water infused with purifying herbs.
2. All participants encircle the fire, taking turns to share a memory, loss, or regret to symbolize the shedding of the old self.
3. The sacrificial offering is presented to the flames, symbolizing the transience of life and the returning of energy to the universe.
4. Using soil or sand, participants draw symbols of personal significance, representing their renewed selves.
5. Participants join in a group embrace, signifying the interconnectedness of life and the support found in shared experiences.

### V. **Climax and Reemergence of Life**:

To conclude the ceremony, a phoenix or similar symbol of rebirth and renewal is set alight and raised high above the participants while the Hymn of Rebirth is sung. The participants will walk away in a solemn procession, single file, continuing their lives with a newfound understanding of the eternal cycle and a sense of clarity and purpose.
