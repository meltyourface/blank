The element of Fire represents transformation, passion, and strength.

- Archangel Uriel is connected with the element of Earth, manifested through wisdom, knowledge, and illumination. He is believed to assist in providing insights, understanding, and guidance to seekers of truth.
- Archangel Gabriel, on the other hand, is associated with the element of Water, signifying communication, intuition, and creativity. He is considered the divine messenger, aiding in the release of creative blocks and facilitating clear communication.

In conclusion, understanding the associations and correspondences between Archangels, their elements, and their intentions is crucial for effective invocations and working with these celestial beings. By selecting the most appropriate Archangel for a specific purpose or intention, one can harness their support and guidance to overcome obstacles and manifest desired outcomes. For protection and courage, Archangel Michael should be the go-to choice.
