As an expert in the esoteric, occult, Archangelic invocations, and education, I will thoroughly analyze and connect the significance of the enigmatic "72 Names of God" in the Kabbalistic tradition with the hierarchy, attributes, and functions of the seven Archangels in Western Esotericism. Furthermore, I will consider the underlying principles and methods of these invocations to access hidden wisdom.

**Context and Background**: The "72 Names of God" stem from the Kabbalistic tradition, which emerged from Jewish mystical thought, while Archangelic invocations are practices rooted in Western Esotericism to channel divine energies and guidance. To form a concrete analysis and connection between these two, we must first understand their individual origins, principles, and functions.

The "72 Names of God" in the Kabbalistic Tradition:
The "72 Names of God" originates from the Kabbalistic understanding of the Torah, the sacred scripture of Judaism. By interpreting certain passages in the text, Kabbalists derived three verses from Exodus, each consisting of 72 letters. Then, by reading the verses sequentially in a particular pattern and combining fragments of these verses, they produced 72 distinct, three-letter combinations, known as the "72 Names of God."

Each Name is connected to specific divine attributes, which are believed to hold power over creation and transformation. When meditated upon or invoked, these Names enable practitioners to connect with the divine energies, thus allowing them access to hidden wisdom and the ability to influence their reality.

The Seven Archangels in Western Esotericism:
In Western Esotericism, the seven Archangels are celestial beings from a divine hierarchy and serve as intermediaries between humanity and the divine. Each Archangel carries specific attributes, qualities, and functions, representing different aspects of God. The seven Archangels, along with their primary attributes, are as follows:

1. Michael - Protection and courage
2. Gabriel - Communication and revelation
3. Raphael - Healing and harmony
4. Uriel - Divine Light and Wisdom
5. Selaphiel - Prayer and reverence
6. Jegudiel - Praise and divine reward
7. Barachiel - Blessings and fortune

When invoked through prayers, rituals, or symbols, the Archangels grant guidance, protection, support, and insight into various aspects of life.

Connecting the "72 Names of God" with the Seven Archangels:
While the "72 Names of God" and the Archangels originate from different traditions, both are intrinsically linked by their purpose: to provide a means for humans to connect with the divine and the powers it holds.

The "72 Names of God" correlate to distinct divine attributes, while the Archangels embody and represent these attributes as celestial intermediaries. Through invoking either the Names or the Archangels in one's spiritual practice, the practitioner taps into the energies associated with these attributes. These energies resonating with specific archetypal forces empowers the practitioner with divine guidance, wisdom, and transformational abilities.

An example of this connection can be seen in the Name "Mebahel" (one of the "72 Names"), which is associated with the concept of truth and justice. This same energy can be traced back to Archangel Michael, who is often depicted wielding a sword to eliminate illusions and injustices.

Underlying Principles and Methods in Invocations:
The key to accessing hidden wisdom through invocations of either the "72 Names of God" or the Archangels lies in building a conscious connection with these energies through intention and devotion. Both systems rely on the following principles:

1. Divine Hierarchy: Recognizing the structured order of divine intermediaries, which allow humans to access higher levels of consciousness.
2. Symbolism: Using symbols, prayers, and rituals to create a channel of communication with the divine forces.
3. Meditation and Visualization: Engaging in mental and spiritual exercises to focus one's thoughts and intentions on specific energies.
4. Personal Transformation: Embracing the pursuit of spiritual growth, inner balance, and wisdom, leading to a higher state of being.

In conclusion, the "72 Names of God" in Kabbalistic tradition and the seven Archangels in Western Esotericism are interrelated through their representations of divine attributes and purposes. Both systems provide a potent means of connecting with hidden wisdom and divine energies by invoking specific names or celestial beings. Through understanding and embracing the underlying principles and practices of these invocations, practitioners can enrich their spiritual journey and access profound wisdom for personal transformation.
