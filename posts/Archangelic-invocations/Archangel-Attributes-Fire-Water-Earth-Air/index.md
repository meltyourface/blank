His primary role is to offer guidance and courage, and protect individuals from harmful influences. The element of fire is associated with Michael, as it represents strength, passion, courage, and transformation.

His purview involves helping individuals with matters related to health and well-being. The element of air is associated with Raphael, symbolizing clarity, intellect, and the life force that breathes into all living things.
