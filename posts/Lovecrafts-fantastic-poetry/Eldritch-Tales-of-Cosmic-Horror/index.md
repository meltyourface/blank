description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Lovecraft's fantastic poetry, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a haunting verse in the vein of Lovecraft's eldritch poetry, delving into the unsettling realm of cosmic horror and extraterrestrial deities. Incorporate elements such as unfathomable entities, the insignificance of humanity, and the tenebrous secrets of the cosmos. Additionally, experiment with Lovecraft's distinct lexicon, using arcane and obscure words to heighten the sense of dread. Construct the poem with a minimum of four stanzas, each consisting of six lines, and with a rhyming scheme of your choosing to enhance its rhythmic allure. Endeavor to construct a chilling narrative that captures the essence of despair and otherworldliness, whilst enveloping the reader in a shroud of darkness and enigma.

## I. 
In realms obscured by Ã¦ons long betrayed,
Where chaos reigns amongst the cosmic winds,
The crawling entities of wan dismay
Hold whispers that portend of mortal sins.
For humankind, in their compulsive guise,
Is naught but dust in the vast gulfs of time.

### II. 
Of elder shapes that slumber in mad dreams,
Awake in cosmic gaols, the dreadful host
Their churning limbs knit shadows of the dark,
Enveloping the hearts of men like fog.
We simply 'bide in ignorance's embrace,
Whilst monstrous beings weave insidious schemes.

### III. 
The blackened stars conceal unholy truths,
And pallid moons reflect the malevolence,
For those who dare uncover cryptic signs
Shall find themselves encompassed by despair.
No prayers shall aid, nor bleating cries resound,
As ciphers raise the fearsome gods betrothed.

### IV. 
This truth we shun, so steeped in frightful awe,
For human minds but scarcely comprehend
The eldritch dwellers veiled in spectral planes,
Who thrive on in the shadow of our dread.
In bleak distress our tales shall voiceless die,
Naught save the chasms of the cosmos infinite.
