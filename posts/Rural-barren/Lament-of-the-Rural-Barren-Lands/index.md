In the heart of the Rural barren land,
Where silence stretches like a canvas wide,
There lies a tale, in each grain of sand,
A timeless chronicle for which I, your guide,
Now sing, with voice of mystery profound,
Through whispers hushed, and ancient rhythms found.

'Tis there upon the desolate expanse,
Isolation weighs like leaden shroud;
Ethereal illusions dance,
While twisted roots of ghostly yews stand proud.
Within this realm, forgotten stories dwell,
So listen close, and let their echoes swell.

A wind-swept prairie, endless to the eye,
Beneath burnt sky, sheds speckled shadow-scars,
Its fields of grass and sagebrush, parched and dry,
Hold steadfast 'gainst unyielding sun's bombard.
Yet, in these lands, an eerie darkness breathes,
The tales entwined like wisps, the midnight weaves.

In deepest night, when naught but shadows flow,
When air is still and lonesome cries are heard,
The wraith-like figures of the days of old,
Waft like a thin, pale mist, their whispers stirred.
Bygone spirits, bound to this terrain,
Walk hand in hand with fleeting beauty, pain.

For all that is, and all that may become,
Reside within this Rural barren plain,
Both beauty and the foulness from it spun,
Where life's contrasts grow intertwined, in twain.
In isolation, nature dares defy,
And weave its subtle, secret tapestry.

In tiny buds of stubborn life, that cling
To hardened earth, one finds a quiet strength,
The beauty in the grime, the will to sing,
Through struggle, hardship, and a world of length.
With every bloom, a story is unfurled,
A chapter of life's book, our lonely world.

So, in this ballad of the Rural barren,
A lonely voice recounts forgotten lore,
To weave a tapestry, complex and wearin',
With themes of timelessness, solitude, and more.
In these forsaken lands, let's not forget,
The tales that linger, old and silent, yet.
