excerpt: > 
  Design a personalized yoga-themed tea blend using a combination of herbs, carefully selected for their spiritual and energetic properties, in order to enhance the overall well-being and mindfulness during and after performing yoga practices. Explore a variety of potential ingredients such as tulsi, chamomile, ashwagandha, and lavender, and experiment with their proportions, creating at least three different blends with unique flavor profiles and energy balancing properties. Additionally, incorporate the use of chakra-aligning elements in the tea blend and suggest ideal yoga sequences that pair well with each blend to maximize the benefits of both the tea and the practice.
