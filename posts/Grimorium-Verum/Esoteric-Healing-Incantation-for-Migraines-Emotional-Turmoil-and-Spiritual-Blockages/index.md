To perform a personalized healing incantation according to the principles of the Grimorium Verum, first we need to gather information about the individual's physical, emotional, and spiritual ailments and connect them to traditional symbols, sigils, and esoteric language. Let's consider an individual suffering from chronic migraines, emotional turmoil, and blockages in spiritual growth.

1. Establish a connection to the individual's personal energy: Inscribe their name (birth name and/or magical name work best), birth date, and the astrological signs at the moment of their birth onto a parchment or paper.

2. Traditional symbols: Address each ailment by their corresponding symbol. For migraines, use the symbol of Rahu, the Hindu lunar deity. For emotional turmoil, incorporate the symbol of Scorpio, which is associated with emotional depth. For spiritual blockages, use the Ankh, the ancient Egyptian symbol of life and transformation.

3. Sigils: Design a sigil that combines the intent of these three symbols to create a unique healing sigil specifically for the individual. Take care to design your sigil in a manner that resonates with the individual being healed.

4. Esoteric language: Write a personalized healing incantation in Latin, as it is traditionally used in occult practices.

Example incantation:

"Rahu, qui luna infligit, doloris capitis sanentur,
Scorpione profundo, spiritus perturbatus pacator,
Ankh vitae, coeat spiritus, transmutatio debeat.

In nomine [Person's Name], 
Sanatus erit, corpora menteque, animarum restaurandi."

**Translation**:

"Rahu, who afflicts the moon, let the migraine be healed,
Deep Scorpio, pacify the disturbed spirit,
The Ankh of life, join the spirit, let transformation succeed.

In the name of [Person's Name],
Let them be healed, body and mind, the restoration of the soul."

5. Ritualistic process: Set up a ritual space with the individual, cleaned and purified, and encircle the area with salt for protection. Decorate the altar with various herbs and crystals associated with healing, such as lavender and amethyst. Place the inscribed parchment in the center and light three candles (blue, white, and green) around it.

6. Cleanse and bless the space: Burn sage, palo santo, or another purifying herb/incense, and pass the smoke around the ritual area to cleanse and remove any negative energies. Recite a blessing to provide protection during the ritual.

7. Perform the incantation: Hold hands with the individual or place your hand on their shoulder. Focus on creating a connection to their energy as you recite the incantation three times. While chanting, guide them in visualizing a healing energy connecting to their body, then expanding to their mind and spirit.

8. Close the ritual: After completing the incantation, thank the energies and spirits for their assistance. Extinguish the candles, dispose of the parchment, and clean up the ritual space. The individual should carry the healing sigil with them afterward, either in the form of a talisman or drawn on their skin, as a reminder of the energy and intent invoked during the ritual.

Remember to respect the individual's beliefs and energy throughout the process, and ensure their complete consent and understanding of each part of the ritual.
