The Grimorium Verum is renowned for its bold and striking approach in presenting the reader with practical and workable information on performing rituals, working with spirits and entities, and harnessing powers beyond the physical world.

Historically, the Grimorium Verum's original author still remains a topic of debate among scholars. The infamous black magic grimoire was allegedly first published in France, containing detailed instructions, sigils, and procedures to evoke spirits and demons and control their actions. It belongs to the Solomonic tradition, a collection of grimoires and texts offering practices, theories, and philosophies revolving around the biblical figure of King Solomon.
