The underlying metaphysical symbolism in the alchemical process of shape-shifting, as it relates to the transformation of one's consciousness and spiritual growth, is a rich and complex tapestry of mysticism and esoteric wisdom. Delving into the history of shape-shifting in prominent occult traditions will allow us to understand the transformative power of this ancient practice and its relevance to personal spiritual development. Key themes we will explore include the concept of the transcendental self, the interconnectedness of all things, and the spiritual purification and enlightenment.

To begin, we must first understand the concept of alchemy. Alchemy is a multifaceted philosophical practice rooted in antiquity, which aimed to purify and perfect materials, with a particular focus on transforming base metals into gold. While the literal outcome of alchemical practices is of great interest, we are primarily concerned with the metaphorical and mystical implications of these processes, which are inherently tied to the evolution and enlightenment of the human soul.

At the heart of the alchemical practice lies the concept of the Magnum Opus, which is the great work of personal transformation, spiritual enlightenment, and divine union with the cosmos. This transformative process is often symbolized by the image of a dying and resurrecting god, or an animal that changes forms. It is this transformative aspect that sets the stage for our exploration into shape-shifting.

Shape-shifting, in the context of occult traditions, is the ability of an individual to change their physical form, often into that of an animal or another human being. This practice has been largely understood to have its roots in various shamanic and indigenous spiritual practices involving trance and astral projection. In these traditions, shape-shifting serves a practical purpose, allowing the shapeshifter to gain knowledge, connect with other worlds, or use the abilities of the animal form they assume.

In terms of the metaphysical symbolism of shape-shifting, we can analyze this concept through the lens of the Hermetic principle of correspondence, which asserts that "as above, so below; as within, so without." This axiom implies that change and transformation on one level of reality inevitably affects other levels, and thus our ability to change our physical form is emblematic of our capacity to transform spiritually.

Indeed, in this context, shape-shifting can be seen as a metaphor for the alchemical processes of Nigredo (blackening), Albedo (whitening), and Rubedo (reddening), which signify stages of purification, illumination, and union with the divine. By shedding previous forms and shifting into new ones, the adept demonstrates their ability to detach from the material world and the ego self, and instead embrace a state of spiritual transcendence and inner liberation.

Prominent occult traditions such as The Golden Dawn, founded in the late 19th century, embraced this symbology and sought to integrate shape-shifting as a component of their initiatory practices. Members of the Golden Dawn were encouraged to access and embrace their inner animal or elemental form through visualization and meditation, symbolic gestures, and invocations, as a means to foster spiritual development and transformation.

In conclusion, the underlying metaphysical symbolism of the alchemical process of shape-shifting, as it relates to the transformation of one's consciousness and spiritual growth, is centered on the themes of transcendental self, the interconnectedness of all things, and the subsequent spiritual purification and enlightenment. Historically rooted in shamanic practices and sustained by esoteric orders such as The Golden Dawn, shape-shifting represents a powerful and vivid metaphor for the transformative process of alchemy on a spiritual level. Through this physical transformation, practitioners are encouraged to grow spiritually and to seek higher states of consciousness, ultimately granting them greater insight into the universal mysteries that surround them.
