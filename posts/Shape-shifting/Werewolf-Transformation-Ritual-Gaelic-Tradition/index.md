## Géas-Laochra na Faolchú
(The Werewolf Warrior's Oath)
**Step 1**: Preparation of the Sacred Site
Identify a secluded location in a forest clearing, preferably one with a direct line of sight to the sky. Upon this site, draw a large, continuous circle using a mixture of ash and cedar bark, creating an unbroken boundary between the natural world and the ritual space. Within the circle, place seven flat stones at even intervals, reflecting the seven ancient werewolf clans.
**Step 2**: Gathering of the Vital Ingredients
To ensure a safe transformation, gather the following items for the ritual:

1. ****Wolfsbane****: A rare and powerful herb that both attracts and controls the spirit of the wolf.

2. ****Mugwort****: An herb commonly used in potions and rituals for protection and strength.

3. ****Moonstone****: A crystal that harnesses the power of the moon to aid and direct the transformation.

4. ****Silver chalice****: Used to hold and bless the transformative potion.
**Step 3**: Preparing the Werewolf Potion
Blend the following ingredients together in the silver chalice:

- One handful of finely ground Wolfsbane
- One handful of dried, crushed Mugwort
- Crushed Moonstone, to a fine powder
- Water from a natural spring, collected during the optimal lunar phase (see Step 4)

Stir the mixture three times clockwise, and three times counterclockwise, evoking the ancient Gaelic chant:

"Láidir faolchú anocht,
Ár neart agus cosaint,
Cabhair linn dul i ngleic,
Géas-laochra le chéile."

(Werewolf warrior of the night,
Strength and protection in our fight,
Help us confront and then connect,
Oath-bound warriors to protect.)
**Step 4**: Optimal Lunar Phase
The ideal time for the Géas-Laochra na Faolchú transformation is during the Full Moon. However, it is recommended to begin the process 3 days prior, harnessing the Waxing Gibbous phase to prepare the body and spirit for the forthcoming change.
**Step 5**: Performing the Ritual
Gather at the ritual site with the collected ingredients and the prepared potion under the designated lunar phase. Light seven beeswax candles, placing each at the center of the corresponding stone. Remove all clothing and stand within the circle, facing the rising moon. Consume the potion in three slow sips, allowing the powerful blend to absorb into the body.
**Step 6**: The Final Invocation
Raise hands towards the moon and recite the following ancient incantation:

"Ó neart na gealaí,
Teacht chugam anocht,
Faolchú mé, laoch na oíche,
Cosaint dom agus mo chlann."

(By the strength of the moonlight,
Come unto me this night,
Werewolf I shall be, warrior of the dark,
Protect me and those I love.)
**Step 7**: Ensuring Safe Transformation
Allow the spirit of the wolf to overcome and envelop the body. Trust in the potency of the gathered ingredients to guide a controlled and intentional metamorphosis. Embrace the newly bestowed power, accepting the role of Géas-Laochra na Faolchú, a revered warrior among both mortals and werewolves alike.

Historical and Cultural Significance
Throughout the ages, many ancient civilizations and cultures incorporated werewolf mythology into their beliefs, imbuing the transformation with great power, respect, and a deep responsibility to protect and defend. Gaelic, Celtic, and Nordic traditions, among others, have long revered the werewolf warrior, acknowledging the balance of humanity and beast that reflects the nature of the soul.

The symbol of the wolf in such ancient societies represents strength, wisdom, and loyalty. The blending of these elements within the ritual is a homage to their origin, empowering one's transformation into a werewolf by calling upon the ancestors who walked this path long before.

The werewolf warrior, known as Géas-Laochra na Faolchú, operates under a strict and ancient code, bound by a spiritual and physical oath to protect both the mortal and supernatural worlds. The ritual serves not only to change one's physical form but also to awaken an innate understanding of their purpose, ensuring that such powers are wielded responsibly and in balance with the lunar cycle's ebb and flow.
