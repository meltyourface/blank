The Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), a fraternal and magical order, was established in the early 20th century by notable occultist Aleister Crowley in his effort to synthesize centuries-old esoteric practices and modern ideas. Within the O.T.O. structure, the ninth degree (or IX°) is of particular importance as it deals with the most guarded practice and core doctrine of the order: sex magick. In this comprehensive response, we will explore the concepts related to sex magick, the formula of Baphomet, and how they are linked to the ultimate goal of attaining Knowledge and Conversation with one's Holy Guardian Angel.

To begin, let's start with the concept of sex magick as understood in the context of the IX°. Sex magick is a practice wherein sexual energy is intentionally directed and utilized for spiritual and magical purposes. The most central idea behind this practice is that the union of opposite polarities, both physical and metaphysical, sets off an immense energetic flow that can propel the practitioner towards states of heightened spiritual awareness and attainment.

Now, let's look at the formula of Baphomet, another key aspect of the IX°. Baphomet is a symbolic representation of the union between the opposites, embodying both male and female, as well as light and darkness, spirit and matter. The figure of Baphomet is often depicted as a creature with a goat's head and a human body, with breasts and phalli, symbolizing the simultaneous presence of male and female energies.

In the context of the O.T.O., the formula of Baphomet refers to a specific way of directing and harnessing the energies released during sexual contact. The primary purpose of the formula is to create a spiritually powerful environment to facilitate the attainment of Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA). The HGA represents an individual's higher self, inner genius, or divine counterpart, and achieving a conscious communion with one's HGA is considered the pinnacle of magical success in various esoteric traditions.

With a better understanding of sex magick and the formula of Baphomet, we can now discuss their interrelationship, and how they impact both the practical and philosophical aspects of the individual's evolution towards union with the HGA.

Practically speaking, the IX° practitioner employs techniques embodying the formula of Baphomet to channel sexual energy for magical purposes. These techniques involve specifics of timing, ritual settings, and sexual positions, all in alignment with the desired intention of the working. Through the use of these methods, the practitioner seeks to create an energetic disruption that transcends the limits of their ordinary consciousness and propels them into a more profound union with their HGA.

On a philosophical level, the interrelationship between sex magick and the formula of Baphomet highlights the essential need to balance and integrate opposing forces within oneself in the pursuit of spiritual development. By bringing together the masculine and feminine energies within themselves and their ritual workings, the IX° practitioner seeks to create a space in which theunion with their HGA can be realized. 

Moreover, the practices related to the IX° represent an evolution of the individual's understanding of their own role in the cosmos. The practitioner, through engaging in these practices, recognizes and celebrates their natural, innate potential for spiritual transformation. In this sense, sex magick and the formula of Baphomet serve as tools by which the practitioner takes responsibility for their own spiritual growth, and no longer relies solely on external religious or spiritual authorities.

In conclusion, the IX° of the Ordo Templi Orientis entails a profound exploration of sex magick and the formula of Baphomet, ultimately aiming for the individual's attainment of Knowledge and Conversation with their Holy Guardian Angel. Both practical and philosophical aspects of this degree emphasize the importance of recognizing and embracing one's inherent potential for spiritual development. The significance of the IX° lies in the transformative potential of integrating and harnessing the opposing energies within oneself, thereby shedding light on the path towards self-realization and divine communion.
