In trochaic march I weave my words,
Of mystic foes and arcane birds,
Chronicles of great magick told,
Those trails of art and power bold.

In history's depths he forged a name,
John Dee, the wizard of black flame,
He spoke in tongues of angels high,
And pierced the veil 'twixt earth and sky.

His obsidian, dark mirror showed,
Visions rich in mystic code,
Astral realms and futures known,
The secrets of creation's throne.

A playwright's friend and counselor,
Elizabeth's own testifier,
With mathematic blood and ink,
His words carved worlds on reason's brink.

His Enochian tongue unveiled,
He shunned the coals where witches sailed,
With golden tablets, purple shrouds,
His voice rang out, eclipsed the clouds.

Upon a crossroads twilight spread,
The philosopher's stone his circle's stead,
For he sought the antidote to time,
In earthly marrow and sublime.

The Monas Hieroglyphica writ,
Its fingerprints on history knit,
In moonlit night, he framed his craft,
And characters of mystic draft.

Sigil upon the parchment drawn,
Summoned spirits to greet the dawn,
In alchemist's pursuit of truth,
He tread the edge, uncouth and ruth.

From scrolls of old, the angels' reign,
He bid their wisdom deign his aim,
Enlightened, he became their liaison,
Between the kingdoms, man and heaven.

In celestial dance the stars intoned,
A subtle musick in his bones,
From voids and gateways far and wide,
In timeless space, his knowledge prized.

His nights upon the castle grounds,
In spectral currents, power found,
He roamed with Kelley, spirit-guide,
Their circle waned, in twilight died.

As whispers spread of darkened arts,
The Church, like hounds, did tear apart,
But Dee, undaunted, held his ground,
And let the word of magick sound.

His legacy, a fulcrum point,
Spanning ages, time's disjoint,
In halls of sorcery and science,
John Dee, a titan of defiance.
