To answer the knowledge challenge set forth, we will first provide brief background information on Gabriele D'Annunzio and an overview of his contribution to Italian literature, followed by an in-depth analysis of three distinctive elements or teachings in his poetry that correlate with occult traditions. Finally, we will trace the origins of these elements within the wider historical and intellectual context.

Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) was an Italian poet, novelist, and dramatist whose literary output was marked by a strong symbolism and an exploration of diverse themes, such as love, beauty, heroism, and death. His artistic vision encapsulated the spirit of the Decadent and Symbolist movements, which were prevalent in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His interests extended beyond literature, encompassing politics, art, and mysticism, and his fascination with the occult is evident in many of his works.

1. ****The First Element****: Esoteric Symbolism

Like many poets and artists associated with the Symbolist and Decadent movements, D'Annunzio employed a wide array of esoteric and mystical symbols in his poetry. Some of his works, such as "The Rain in the Pinewood," utilize alchemical and astrological symbols, which were commonly studied and practiced in occult circles. This reliance on esoteric symbolism could be traced back to the Hermetic and Gnostic traditions of late antiquity, the Renaissance rediscovery of these works, and their influence on modern esoteric orders like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

2. ****The Second Element****: The Ideal of the Übermensch

One of D'Annunzio's most distinctive themes is the aspiration towards the Übermensch, or "Superman," an idealized figure that surpasses conventional human limitations and possesses extraordinary qualities. This concept, heavily influenced by the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, resonates with the occult teachings of overcoming and transcending one's human nature through spiritual development. The origins of this idea in the occult context can be traced to various mystical traditions, such as the Eastern concept of the Bodhisattva and the Western archetypes like the Magician, the Alchemist, and the Christ-figure. D'Annunzio's heroes, like the protagonist in his novel "The Triumph of Death," are often portrayed as striving towards this level of spiritual and intellectual supremacy.

3. ****The Third Element****: Life and Death Duality

A recurring theme in D'Annunzio's poetry is the exploration of the dual nature of life and death, which is also a fundamental concept in many mystical and occult disciplines. His poem "La Morte del Sole" (The Death of the Sun) exemplifies this, as it delves into the interplay between the dying sun and the fleetingness of life. This theme is aligned with the Tarot's Death card, which represents transformation, rebirth, and the cyclical nature of existence. This understanding of life and death as two interconnected aspects of reality can be traced back to ancient mythologies and religious beliefs, as well as more recent esoteric traditions like Rosicrucianism and Theosophy, where reincarnation and the eternal soul are key elements of their doctrines.

In summary, the three key themes or elements within Gabriele D'Annunzio's poetry that correlate with occult traditions are (1) the use of esoteric symbolism, drawing upon alchemical, astrological, and mythological symbols, (2) the pursuit of the Übermensch as a symbol of transcendence, and (3) the exploration of the duality of life and death as interrelated forces. These themes have their origins in a variety of older and contemporaneous mystical, esoteric, and philosophical traditions, showcasing the interaction between various strands of intellectual history and the creative genius of D'Annunzio.
