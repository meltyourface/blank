excerpt: > 
  Compose a sonnet centered around the enigmatic and mystical universe of Occult manuscriptsItalian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, drawing inspiration from both the heretical cosmological views and the philosophical convictions of the renowned thinker Giordano Bruno. Infuse the poem with arcane metaphors and symbolic references to ancient secret societies, weaving a multilayered tapestry that reveals the hidden connections between the esoteric doctrines and the revolutionary ideas that cost Bruno his life. To further enhance the complexity and richness of the sonnet, experiment with unusual rhyme schemes, and incorporate archaic words and phrases to mimic the cryptic language found in occult manuscripts.

Upon the hidden sphere Giordano stood,
The mystic threads of cosmos which he wove,
In martyrdom for secrets he behooved
That breached the sable vault of God's own brood.

In D'Annunzio's obscured poetic verse,
The truths enshrouded lay as coiling snakes,
No charms, nor arts to bind, for mercy's sake,
But sacred signs, revealèd and diverse.

In ancient scrolls, the fraternità,
They weav'd harmonìa of heaven and earth,
The waxing, waning fire that gave rebirth
To truths divine, suppressed for cen'rìa.

And thus, occultèd words do form this chain,
As pris'ners of the shadows break their bane.
