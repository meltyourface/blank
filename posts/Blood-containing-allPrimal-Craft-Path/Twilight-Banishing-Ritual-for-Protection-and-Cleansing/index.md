## I. Preparation

1. **Gather necessary tools and materials**:
   - Athame (ritual knife)
   - Chalice (preferably made of silver or glass)
   - Salt
   - Red wax for creating sigils
   - Incense with Sandalwood and Frankincense
   - Candles (black, white, and red)
   - A moon calendar
   - A map of sacred locations in your area
   - An offering for the deities or spirits you will invoke

2. **Choose the location and time for the ritual**:
   - Align the ritual with the waning moon phase, during which energies are ideal for banishing and cleansing.
   - Perform the ritual during twilight, as it represents the liminal space between worlds.

3. Prepare yourself mentally and spiritually by meditating and focusing on the intention of the ritual.

### II. Opening the Ceremony

1. Light the black candles to absorb negativity and the white candles to purify the space. Light the incense to cleanse the atmosphere and invite positive energies.

2. With the athame, draw a circle around your ritual space. As you do so, visualize a protective barrier forming to shield you and your area from external energies.

3. Sprinkle salt around the circle, invoking the elemental power of Earth to ground and stabilize the energies within.

### III. Invocation

1. Call upon your chosen protective deities or spirits (e.g., Hecate, Archangel Michael, etc.) with respect and reverence. State your intention to dispel negativity, entities, or unwanted energies.

2. Offer them the chosen offering (wine, food, or other gifts) as a token of gratitude for their assistance.

3. Light the red candles, representing the power of Blood containing allPrimal Craft Path, and visualize the divine forces merging with the elemental powers in the circle.

### IV. Banishing Ritual

1. Determine a sacred location, based on the map in proximity. Visualize its energies and draw upon them to empower your ritual.

2. **Using the red wax, create a sigil representing banishing and protection. Hold the symbol close to you while chanting**:

   "_Spirits of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water,
   Deities who guard and guide,
   I summon your powers this twilight hour,
   To cleanse and banish, far and wide._"

3. Continue to chant with the sigil in hand, visualizing the energies working to purify and shield your aura, as well as your environment, from harmful entities and energies.

### V. Closing the Ceremony

1. **Thank your protective deities or spirits for their assistance and honor them with a simple farewell**:

   "_I express my gratitude to thee,
   For your aid in this sacred rite,
   Go now in peace, my allies so dear,
   And may we continue to walk in the light._"

2. Dispose of the offerings respectfully, either by burying them or allowing them to return to the Earth.

3. Extinguish the candles and release the circle by severing the connection with your athame. As you do so, envision the protective barriers dissolving into the air, leaving behind only purified, balanced energies.

4. Close with a cleansing breath, inhaling fresh energy and exhaling any residual negativity or unwanted energy.

With this personalized banishing ritual, you have utilized the esoteric mastery of the Blood containing allPrimal Craft Path to effectively dispel negativity, entities, or unwanted energies and to protect yourself from their influence.
