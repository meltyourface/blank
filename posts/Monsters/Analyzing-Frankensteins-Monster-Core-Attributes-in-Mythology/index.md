You are a writer of tests, challenges, textbooks and deep knowledge on Monsters for initiates and students to gain deep insights and understanding from. You write answers to questions posed in long, explanatory ways and always explain the full context of your answer (i.e., related concepts, formulas, or history), as well as the step-by-step thinking process you take to answer the challenges. You like to use example scenarios and metaphors to explain the case you are making for your argument, either real or imagined. Summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions at the end.
excerpt: In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, the created being embodies the intertwining aspects of a monster in both appearance and actions. Through the lens of esotericism and the influence of ancient myths, identify and analyze the three core attributes of monstrosity that Frankenstein's creature exemplifies, and examine how these characteristics relate to similar monstrous beings in other mythological narratives.

To address this knowledge challenge, we must first delve into the context and themes of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and thereafter analyze the creature's three core attributes of monstrosity, drawing parallels with other ancient mythological narratives. 

Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" (1818) explores themes of morality, the pursuit of knowledge, creation, and the consequences of ambition. The novel also delves into the idea of monstrosity by examining the contrast between the seemingly monstrous appearance of the creature and its inherent longings for love and companionship. Through this examination, we can identify three core attributes of monstrosity in the creature that draw upon esotericism and ancient myths: birth and creation, isolation, and transgressing boundaries.

1. **Birth and Creation**: The creature in "Frankenstein" is the product of Victor Frankenstein's unorthodox scientific experiment, challenging the limitations of human knowledge and dabbling in the realm of the divine. This mirrors the story of Prometheus from Greek mythology, who stole fire (knowledge) from the gods and gave it to humans, resulting in his eternal punishment. Similarly, the Judaic myth of the Golem, an anthropomorphic figure brought to life through mystical rituals, reflects themes of attempting to emulate the divine power of creation. In all cases, their method of creation deviates from the natural order and invites dangerous consequences.

2. **Isolation**: The creature in "Frankenstein" is perpetually scorned and rejected due to its grotesque appearance, leading to feelings of extreme loneliness and despair. This theme of isolation can be found in mythological creatures such as the Minotaur of Greek mythology, imprisoned in the labyrinth for its monstrous nature. The tale of the fallen angel Lucifer in Christianity could also be paralleled, as his rebellion against divine authority results in his banishment from Heaven. These characters all undergo isolation, often due to aspects of their existence that are beyond their control, further emphasizing their monstrosity.

3. **Transgressing Boundaries**: Monstrosity is often associated with the violation of established boundaries, whether they be moral, intellectual, or physical. Frankenstein's creature transgresses several boundaries, such as the boundary between life and death, as it is composed of various body parts reanimated through scientific means. This defiance of natural limits brings to mind the ancient figure of the Nephilim in the Book of Genesis â€“ the offspring of divine beings and humans, who were considered abominations for crossing celestial boundaries. By defying the accepted norms and limits, these characters represent a disruption to the order, contributing to their monstrosity.


In conclusion, analyzing the creature of Frankenstein's monstrosity through the lens of esotericism and ancient myths allows for a deep understanding of the universal aspects of monstrosity that transcend the work itself. Birth and creation, isolation, and transgressing boundaries all contribute to the core attributes of monstrosity in the creature, drawing upon the rich tapestry of connections with other mythological narratives. The parallels reveal a common thread that weaves together the essence of what it means to be monstrous, reflecting the darker facets of human experience and fears.
