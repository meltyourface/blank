## The Rite of Pivotal Alignment

**Objective**: To strengthen the bond with the potent spirit Oriens during moments of self-expansion and growth, using the domain knowledge of Asmodeus and Oriens.

**Materials**:

1. An altar table
2. Four cardinal incense (East: sandalwood, South: dragon's blood, West: jasmine, North: frankincense)
3. Asmodeus's Sigil
4. Oriens's Sigil
5. One compass to lay out the sacred space
6. One chalice filled with red wine
7. Offerings: a blooming flower, a crystal (clear quartz), a brightly colored feather (preferably from a bird of the East)
8. A red or black ceremonial robe
9. A ritual dagger or athame
10. Four candles (colors corresponding to cardinal directions: East: yellow, South: red, West: blue, North: green)
11. A parchment paper to write the desired self-expansion manifestation

**Procedure**:

1. Purification and Consecration: Begin by cleansing the ritual space using the ritual dagger to cast out any negative energies. Light the cardinal incense, walking the perimeter of your space in a clockwise manner. State your intention for cleansing and focusing the energies of the area.

2. Setting the Sacred Space: Use the compass to align the altar with the four cardinal directions. Place one candle at each cardinal point on the altar. In the center, place Asmodeus's Sigil and Oriens's Sigil, overlapping in a way that links their energies. Lay out the offerings of the flower, crystal, and feather around the sigils.

3. Casting the Circle: Dress in the ceremonial robe and stand facing East. Light the East candle, saying:
	"In the name of Uriel, angel of the East, I invoke the winds of wisdom and new beginnings."
	 Turn and face the South. Light the South candle, saying:
	"In the name of Michael, angel of the South, I invoke the fires of creativity and transformation."
	 Turn and face the West. Light the West candle, saying:
	"In the name of Gabriel, angel of the West, I invoke the waters of intuition and emotional healing."
	 Turn and face the North. Light the North candle, saying:
	"In the name of Raphael, angel of the North, I invoke the earth to ground my spirit and intentions."

4. Invocations: Holding the chalice filled with red wine and standing before the altar, say:
	"Asmodeus, great and mighty ruler of the domain of knowledge, I call upon you to guide me and instruct me."
	 Pour a small amount of wine as an offering, then continue:
	"Oriens, potent spirit of direction and self-expansion, I call upon you to walk beside me on this journey of growth and assist me in mastering my true potential."

5. Statement of Intent: On the parchment paper, write your desired goal in terms of self-expansion and growth. Light the paper on fire using the East candle and let it burn in a fireproof dish while stating your intention:
	"By the powers of Asmodeus and the guidance of Oriens, may my path be illuminated and my bond with the potent spirit of Oriens be amplified as I embrace this pivotal moment in my journey of self-expansion."

6. Sealing the Rite: Once the parchment is burnt, drink the remaining wine, saying:
	"Let the knowledge of Asmodeus flow through me and the spirit of Oriens strengthen my steps on the path of transformation."

7. Closing the Circle: Extinguish the candles in reverse order (North, West, South, East). Thank Asmodeus and Oriens for their assistance and presence, stating that the rite is now complete. Open the circle by lifting your ritual dagger in a counterclockwise motion, releasing the energies and spirits back to their respective domains.

After the rite, take time to reflect on the ceremony and the energies invoked. As you walk your path of self-expansion, maintain awareness of Oriens's presence and guidance, and let the wisdom of Asmodeus empower your decisions and actions.
