In order to respond to this knowledge challenge, let us first understand the context of the myths of the Tree of Knowledge and the story of Prometheus, as well as the Ancient Egyptian initiation rituals. This will set the stage for a thorough comparison of the consequences of acquiring forbidden knowledge, as well as an analysis of the necessity and transformation of these initiation rituals.

The myths of the Tree of Knowledge originate from the biblical tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. They were instructed not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil from God, but curiosity and temptation led them to disobey this command. As a result, they gained the knowledge of good and evil, experiencing shame, and were expelled from the Garden of Eden. In this myth, the consequence of acquiring forbidden knowledge led to the fall of humanity.

On the other hand, the story of Prometheus comes from Greek mythology. Prometheus, a Titan, is said to have stolen fire (symbolizing knowledge, wisdom, and skills) from the gods to give to humanity. This act of defiance angered the gods, especially Zeus. As a punishment, Prometheus was chained to a rock where an eagle would come to eat his liver daily, only for it to regrow every night. The humanity, however, benefited from the gift of fire and knowledge to progress and civilize.

Ancient Egyptian initiation rituals were an essential part of the mystery schools and the process of spiritual transformation. These rituals allowed initiates to acquire divine wisdom, understanding, and a connection to the gods and the universe. Integral to the Egyptian belief system, the rituals were designed to guide the individual through both an inner and outer journey, eventually undergoing a personal transformation.

Comparing the consequences of acquiring forbidden knowledge in these myths, we can see a common theme of defiance against authority, whether divine or otherwise, and the struggle for knowledge. The Tree of Knowledge myth presents the gaining of knowledge as a transgression, causing humanity's fall from grace and resulting in the loss of paradise. In this context, the acquisition of forbidden knowledge had negative consequences for both the individuals involved and humanity as a whole.

However, in the story of Prometheus, although the acquisition of forbidden knowledge led to the punishment for the Titan, it ultimately benefited humanity by granting them the means to progress, develop, and evolve. This myth posits that forbidden knowledge can be a mixed blessing, with both positive consequences for humanity but dire punishment for those who defy the gods.

When analyzing the necessity and transformation of Ancient Egyptian initiation rituals, we can see a different approach to acquiring knowledge. Rather than forbidden knowledge being solely negative or a double-edged sword for humanity, these initiation rituals demonstrate the pursuit of knowledge as a key aspect of human development and enlightenment. They emphasize the importance of embracing knowledge under proper guidance and within the context of spiritual and personal growth.

In conclusion, the consequences of acquiring forbidden knowledge in the myths of the Tree of Knowledge and the story of Prometheus are vastly different, with the former underscoring the danger of knowledge, leading to humanity's downfall, while the latter portrays it as a catalyst for progress, albeit at a great personal cost to the bringer of knowledge. Further, an analysis of the Ancient Egyptian initiation rituals suggests that a structured and guided acquisition of knowledge is essential for personal growth and enlightenment. Together, these myths and rituals highlight the complex relationship between humanity, authority, and the role of knowledge in shaping our existence.
