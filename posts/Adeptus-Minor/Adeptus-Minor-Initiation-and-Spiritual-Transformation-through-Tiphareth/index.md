To provide a thorough understanding of the relationship between the Adeptus Minor grade, the Sephirah Tiphareth, and the initiation of 'death and resurrection' within the context of spiritual transformation in the Western esoteric tradition, we must first lay the foundation by individually examining each element and then explore how these elements interconnect.

The Adeptus Minor grade is a level of initiation within the Western esoteric tradition, particularly in the system of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The grade represents an advanced stage in an individual's spiritual development and typically signifies a significant amount of learning, experience, and personal growth. The Adeptus Minor is often seen as a transitional stage where the individual moves from a focus on personal development to a more service-oriented path. This shift in focus is evident in the understanding and application of esoteric wisdom for the greater good.

The Sephirah Tiphareth, also known as the Sixth Sephirah, is a sphere within the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It represents the principle of harmony and balance, serving as a central point that unites the higher, more divine aspects with the lower, more earthly ones. Tiphareth is associated with spiritual beauty, the spiritual heart, and transformative power through the integration of opposites. It is here that one's personal will aligns with the divine will, leading to a more profound connection with the Divine and a clearer understanding of one's purpose.

The initiation of 'death and resurrection' refers to an essential transformative process in the spiritual journey of an individual. This concept is prevalent in various Western esoteric traditions, such as alchemy and types of mysticism. This process involves the symbolic death of an individual's old self, followed by a rebirth or awakening to a new, higher state of being. This transformation is said to bring about an increased awareness and understanding of the Divine and one's place in the cosmos, as well as a renewed sense of purpose in life.

Now that we have established an understanding of these individual components, let us examine their interconnected relationship. The Adeptus Minor grade is intrinsically linked to the Sephirah Tiphareth because the attainment of this grade requires one to undergo the transformative process of 'death and resurrection.' This initiation represents the transition from the purely personal to the universal, as the initiate learns to align their will with the Divine will.

In the Adeptus Minor grade, the initiate experiences the symbolic death of the ego-self, learns to let go of attachments and unhealthy patterns, and faces the inevitability of their physical death. As they pass through this metaphorical death, they are reborn into a new and more profound understanding of themselves and the universe. Their heart becomes a reflection of the spiritual beauty and harmony found in Tiphareth, allowing them to be a conduit for the Divine light in the world.

During this transformative process, the initiate also receives guidance and instruction from the Adeptus Minor's spiritual hierarchy, which further helps them integrate the spiritual lessons they encounter in Tiphareth. This support ensures that the initiate can continue their journey through the higher grades and eventually move closer to a more profound union with the Divine.

In conclusion, the Adeptus Minor grade, the Sephirah Tiphareth, and the initiation of 'death and resurrection' are closely interconnected within the context of spiritual transformation in the Western esoteric tradition. The Adeptus Minor grade is a stage of initiation where the individual undergoes a profound transformation by experiencing the symbolic death and resurrection, thus aligning their personal will with the Divine will. This transformative process is intimately linked to the spiritual beauty and universal harmony represented by the Sephirah Tiphareth. Ultimately, this interconnection results in the spiritual growth of the individual and a more profound understanding and connection with the Divine.
