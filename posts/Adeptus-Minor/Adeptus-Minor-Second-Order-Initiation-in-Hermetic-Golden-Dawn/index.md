The correct statement regarding the significance and required knowledge of Adeptus Minor within the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is:

- Marks the initiation into the Second Order, where members are expected to possess a deep understanding of alchemy, astrology, and Qabalah.

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a secret society that was founded in the late 19th century in England. It was dedicated to the study and practice of the occult, metaphysics, and paranormal activities. The Order was structured around a hierarchy of grades, each with its own curriculum and objectives, through which its members (called "initiates") would progress as they advanced in their studies and mastery of the occult arts.

The Adeptus Minor grade marked the initiation into the Second Order, also known as the "Inner Order" or "Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis." This was a significant milestone for members, as it meant that they had successfully completed the curriculum of the First Order and had demonstrated a deep understanding of the esoteric knowledge required for advancement.

Members who reached the Adeptus Minor grade were expected to possess a comprehensive understanding of alchemy, astrology, and Qabalah. These three pillars of occult knowledge served as the foundation for much of the Order's teachings and rituals. Alchemy deals with the transformation of matter and the search for spiritual enlightenment, and within the context of the Golden Dawn, it relates to the search for the "Philosopher's Stone" - the mythical substance that could turn base metals into gold, as well as grant immortality. Astrology involves the study of the cosmic influences of celestial bodies on individuals, natural phenomena, and worldly events. The Qabalah (or Kabbalah) is a mystical Jewish tradition that teaches about the nature of divinity and the structure of the universe through the analysis of sacred texts and the symbolism of numbers and letters.

As initiated members of the Second Order, adepts of Adeptus Minor were also expected to continue their studies, learning advanced rituals and esoteric theories while contributing to the knowledge and operations of the Order. The Golden Dawn placed a strong emphasis on personal development and growth, with the ultimate aim of attaining spiritual understanding and attaining one's true will by mastering the hidden forces of the universe.

In summary, the Adeptus Minor within the context of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn signifies a member who has reached the Second Order, displaying a profound knowledge of alchemy, astrology, and Qabalah, and embarking on their journey towards advanced esoteric studies and spiritual growth.
