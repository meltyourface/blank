In order to deeply understand the transformative self-awareness and spiritual growth practices in both Western Esotericism and Eastern Occult traditions, we must first examine the key rituals and components that form the basis of these practices. The synthesis of these practices into a comprehensive, deep contemplative exercise will provide us with an opportunity to cultivate a greater level of self-awareness and understanding of our spiritual nature.

Key Rituals and Components in Western Esotericism:
1. **The Qabalistic Tree of Life**: A highly symbolic representation of the universe and the human soul, the Tree of Life consists of ten spheres (Sephiroth) connected by 22 paths. Each sphere represents a divine aspect of creation, while each path correlates with a Hebrew letter and a corresponding Tarot card.

2. **Alchemy**: An esoteric art that aims to transform base metals into gold (symbolic of spiritual enlightenment), alchemy offers a parallel to the inner journey of spiritual growth. By refining the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of oneself, one can eventually achieve an enlightened state.

3. **Ritual Magic**: Ceremonial magic and practices, such as those found in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, often use complex rituals, invocations, and the use of symbols and talismans in order to bring about desired change in the practitioner's life.

Key Rituals and Components in Eastern Occult Practices:
1. **Vipassana Meditation**: A Buddhist practice that focuses on cultivating self-awareness through mindfulness. It involves cultivating an impartial awareness of the present moment, free from attachment or judgment.

2. **Tantra**: A Hindu or Buddhist esoteric practice that seeks to unite the divine feminine and masculine principles within the individual, often through the use of sacred rituals, mantras, and visualization techniques.

3. **Qigong**: A Chinese practice that cultivates life energy (qi) by coordinating breath, movement, and mental focus. Through this practice, increased self-awareness, healing, and spiritual growth can be achieved.

Synthesis of Western Esotericism and Eastern Occult Practices:
To integrate the key rituals, symbolic components, magical correspondences, and philosophical underpinnings of both Western Esotericism and Eastern Occult practices, we can develop a comprehensive contemplative exercise.

1. Begin by setting a sacred space, either through the casting of a circle in the Western ceremonial magic tradition or the creation of a mandala in the Eastern tantric tradition.

2. Proceed with a series of deep, slow breaths, focusing your attention on your breath and the sensations in your body. This will help to center and ground your energy.

3. Visualize the Qabalistic Tree of Life within yourself, with each sphere representing an aspect of your being in need of spiritual growth or healing. Use the corresponding Tarot cards to explore a particular theme or issue you wish to address.

4. Engage in a Vipassana-style meditation, observing the thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations that arise as you contemplate each sphere and its corresponding Tarot card. Approach this observation with a sense of curiosity, non-attachment, and non-judgment.

5. Combine elements from alchemy and Tantra, imagining a process of spiritual refinement wherein the impure, or base aspects of your being, are transformed into enlightened, or golden, qualities. You may also want to connect this process with the inner union of masculine and feminine energies.

6. Conclude the exercise by performing a Qigong-inspired movement and breathwork routine, allowing the energy stirred up during the meditation and visualization to flow freely throughout your body.

In summary, combining key rituals, symbolic components, magical correspondences, and philosophical underpinnings from both Western Esotericism and Eastern Occult practices can lead to a deep, transformative self-awareness exercise. With consistent practice, this will allow the individual to experience spiritual growth and a connection with their authentic, divine nature.
