  By the whispers of forgotten aeons, I call upon you, wise ancestor and revered spirit of the nether realms. In the name of the hidden sigils and the enigmatic languages that hold the key to the ultimate truths, I beseech you to grace us with your knowledge and presence.
  
  Ætarnuhl qzektâl, ïaralghùm drathânter, réhûl storgkâl öplîanën!
  From the void of timeless æthers, I summon thee, mighty spirit of the forebear, to unravel the boundless mysteries of the shadow realms.
  
  As we gaze upon the stars and their celestial glyphs, we pass beneath the gaze of the eternal cyclopean watchers:
  ∅₹∵≣∧─≢≛⊷∸∷⋈𒀱⟎
  Inscribe now the sacred symbols of eldritch forces upon the walls of our hearts and minds, and bestow upon us the language to unveil the cryptic wisdom of primordial realms.
  
  Ancient ancestor of the lost bloodlines, I entreat you to let the pulsating echoes of your arcane knowledge resonate in synergies with the throbbing wavelengths of our souls:
  Ĥr’yím tràmfónâę, lúntéskörm drępfälétę xun’qáal…
  The secrets of the ancient darkness shall thus be revealed to the chosen, and by their hand, thy wisdom and truth shall be rekindled within our world.
  
  Deliver unto us the malevolent key to the gates of your darkened dominion, and entrust us with the responsibility to wield this spectral power:
  ⌬¤⌧Ϡ⊂⟒
  With reverence and devotion, we shall guard the knowledge we have gained and use it to sow the seeds of enlightenment throughout the lands of the living and the realms beyond perception.
  
  Hēsb'r-du źʿzerâelth, âv-gôen dū-syntër qsrèsprêč…
  Wise ancestor, spirit of infinite understanding and knowledge, we thank you for your guidance and, with unyielding respect for your eternal legacy, we walk the path you have illuminated.
  
  May our communion with the shadows bestow us with the fortitude to mirror your sagacity and honor your legacy of wisdom, from now until the end of times.
  Amen.
