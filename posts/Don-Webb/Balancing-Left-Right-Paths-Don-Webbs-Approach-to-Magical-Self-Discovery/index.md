The knowledge challenge is as follows:

In which two specific works by Don Webb does he illustrate the interplay between Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path practices, and how do these narratives convey a balanced approach to magical self-discovery, subsequently demonstrating their practical impact on the initiate's own spiritual development?

The two specific works by Don Webb where the interplay between Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path practices are illustrated are "Mysteries of the Temple of Set" (2005) and "Overthrowing the Old Gods: Aleister Crowley and the Book of the Law" (2017). We will explore how these works embody the balanced approach to magical self-discovery and the practical impact on the initiate's spiritual development.

1. "Mysteries of the Temple of Set" (2005)

In "Mysteries of the Temple of Set", Webb delves into the history, philosophy, and magical practices of the Temple of Set, a Left-Hand Path occult organization. The Left-Hand Path is characterized by the pursuit of self-deification and individuation, which can be seen as antithetical to the Right-Hand Path's focus on union with a higher power and adherence to a predefined moral code. 

Within this work, Webb acknowledges the importance of a balanced approach by emphasizing the coexistence of both paths in achieving individuation. He explores concepts and techniques from various cultural traditions and their relation to the pillars of the Temple's Xeper and Remanifest process. Through this work, Webb shows that Left-Hand Path practitioners can benefit from the self-exploration and introspection found within Right-Hand Path disciplines while maintaining their distinct individuality and process of self-deification.

This balanced approach results in a more holistic path of self-discovery for the initiate, embracing both external and internal influences. By providing a comprehensive view of the Temple of Set's teachings, initiates are equipped with a strong ideological framework that aids their spiritual development.

2. **"Overthrowing the Old Gods**: Aleister Crowley and the Book of the Law" (2017)

In "Overthrowing the Old Gods", Webb examines the impact of Aleister Crowley's work on modern occultism, focusing on the Left-Hand Path implications within Crowley's system of Thelema. Thelema blends aspects from both Left-Hand and Right-Hand Path traditions, creating a balanced approach to magical self-discovery.

Thelema's unique combination of law and individualism challenges conventional notions of morality while recognizing the initiatory value of certain Right-Hand Path elements. In this work, Webb demonstrates how Crowley's integration of Left-Hand Path principles, such as self-deification and personal ethics, with Right-Hand Path rituals and communion with non-human intelligences provides practitioners with a comprehensive system for spiritual development.

This interconnectedness between both paths illustrates the importance of balance within magical self-discovery, allowing initiates in Thelema to experience the best of both worlds while pursuing their Will. Webb, in his exploration of Thelema, validates the significance of a balanced approach in the practical impact on the spiritual development of the individual practitioner.

In conclusion, Don Webb's "Mysteries of the Temple of Set" and "Overthrowing the Old Gods: Aleister Crowley and the Book of the Law" are two specific works where the interplay between Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path practices are elucidated. These works convey the importance of a balanced approach to magical self-discovery, acknowledging that both paths have valuable aspects that, when combined, can result in a more comprehensive and successful spiritual development process for the initiate.
