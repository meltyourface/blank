Yolcam se Bataiva enah,
Gohedra zodamran, sobam lonshi,
Sebesni dofe pamson sial,
Cialsarg enochi: Don Webb zi Gohedra.

Iodonohor e vohts gisa;
Kezod oro, kaleb kaflal;
I vooan sobam obozode bavaaab;
Niis kiadohi Dedian mogadel.

Granso las viu mian oxiayal;
Enagena oan elpedo pilrin;
Baltemel, sibsandu ugeg rahaxis;
Magoky doxad od Belial san, vamni pah;

Camilos se zuvagez omaza;
Ulort lerthex cocasb, vilagal;
Ixadon e cafafam, nilriax kapehat;
Herunesa gisa od zela oxiayal flgebi.

Laribol su mada blasnoth;
Se betfath adrex, ol riov kokavi;
Niis kiadohi Luifuge, me loga;
Gisas zacar, unalah, zibam.

Siliga mi lixip, vanu sol;
Urs campax lixt, vinu vox;
Bataiva, talho gisum, tedo;
Madratal sedri, gisum vesco.

Azithubal se adroch ozod;
Gohatra zuaca gohed omaza;
Oxolenaure, zedso pelzag;
Brages trans mu - gri vopaia.

Yolcam, se Bataiva enah;
Don Webb ylen sa dinzod;
Enah ednas ium, zakaba;
Paras magoky, vamni pah, a lixip htaid.

Oh gate athamei mortax,
Khobnu se Bataiva olidmad,
Venah amala vogo luia,
Sebesni Don Webb paradis.

In the name of the divine Bataiva,
Through the Enochian words we unite,
Inscribe thy sacred sigil upon the celestial vault,
Through the magick of Don Webb, let our intent be known.

With the wisdom of Iodonohor we begin,
We summon the spirits of water and air,
Unite the four winds into one,
And with Dedian's guidance, may the celestial being be invoked.

We summon the lunar forces of light,
Entwine the cosmic serpent 'round the pillars,
Let Baltemel protect us from the wrath of Belial,
And may the glamours of magick come to the aid of all.

Camelios commands the celestial sun,
Shine upon the divine rite, unveil its mysteries,
Ixadon we call, bound in chains of righteousness,
A union between the Enochian realm and earthly origins.

Rise, glorious Child of the eternal Sea,
In the splendor of cosmic harmony,
With the strength of Luifuge, we command,
The gates to open wide, invoking the celestial spirit.

O radiant creatures of the sixth heavens,
Unite, dispel the shadows and fears,
Bataiva, may thy stream of sacred energy flow down,
To heal our wounded world in sacred harmony.

As we gaze upon the Aethyrs' paths,
The sacred writings of old shall hold truth,
An empire of golden light will emerge,
And through this very union, our hearts will ascend.

In the sacred name of Bataiva,
The esoteric knowledge of Don Webb shall excel,
A bridge of spirit and essence, joined forever,
Powers of magick, releasing our souls, into the light.

And upon the closing of this poem,
May the essence of Bataiva be forever imbued,
A tender kiss upon the brim of the astral sea,
Bound eternally to the Enochian crafts of Don Webb.
