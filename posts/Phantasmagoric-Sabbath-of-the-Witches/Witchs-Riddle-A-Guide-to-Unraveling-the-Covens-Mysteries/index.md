In the shadow of the moon, when whispers wake the dead,
An ancient gathering stirs, in shadows secrets bred.
Seek ye the untold wisdom, of witches' hallowed rite,
Solve me this perplexing enigma, and join the mystic night.

Unfurl the twisted knot, of serpents two entwined,
Their venom holds the truth, in secret tongues enshrined.
Mark the hours of the Sabbath, from dusk till dawn's first cry,
Reveal the hidden figure, where darkness meets the sky.

First, the five-horned spirit crowned with lunar glory,
Summon twisted echoes through a cyclical history.
Then unto the wise crone, treading paths unseen,
Lend her your perception, and with mortal eyes grow keen.

Thrice the maiden spirals, weaving fate and charm,
Trace her steps betwixt the stars, and fear no ill nor harm.
Once the infernal host is gathered, their council echoes true,
Divide their strength by shadows cloaked, revealing secrets due.

Take each hint, and carefully arrange them in an order,
Assemble essence lost in time, and cross the sacred border.
Weep not for those who fail to divine the riddle's heart,
A coven's cryptic portal opened only to the art.

Only those initiated, deciphering the puzzle shall unveil,
The entrance to the arcane convocation, where the witches' rites prevail.
