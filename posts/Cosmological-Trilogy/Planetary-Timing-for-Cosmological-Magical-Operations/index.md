You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Conduct a comprehensive planetary hours analysis, specifically tailored to the Cosmological Trilogy domain, for the optimal timing of an intricate magical operation involving the summoning of celestial entities from the three main realms of existence. Utilize the doctrine of the seven classical planets, the correlations between their governing hours and mystical influences, and consider astrological alignments and elemental associations to enhance the effectiveness of this specific magical operation.

To conduct a comprehensive planetary hours analysis tailored to the Cosmological Trilogy domain for the optimal timing of an intricate magical operation involving the summoning of celestial entities from the three main realms of existence, we must first understand the seven classical planets and their governing hours and mystical influences in relation to the Cosmological Trilogy. **The seven classical planets are**:

1. The Sun - Governs the hours of power and success.
2. The Moon - Governs the hours of intuition, dreams, and the subconscious.
3. Mars - Governs the hours of strength, aggression, and battles.
4. Mercury - Governs the hours of communication, intellect, and travel.
5. Jupiter - Governs the hours of wisdom, growth, and expansion.
6. Venus - Governs the hours of love, beauty, and harmonious relationships.
7. Saturn - Governs the hours of structure, discipline, and lessons.

Taking into account that the intricate magical operation we want to perform involves the summoning of celestial entities from the three main realms of existence (celestial, terrestrial, and infernal), we must analyze the optimal hour for each of the seven planetary correspondences.

The optimal timing bridges the three main realms of existence through the connection of the Sun, Moon, and other planets' cosmic alignments. Considering elemental associations and astrological alignments, the magical operation would be most effective during the following hours:

1. Sunrise (Sun Hour) - The initial celestial gateway is opened, and the entities from the celestial realm can be contacted with more ease.

2. Sunset (Moon Hour) - The terrestrial entities can be reached during this hour, as twilight connects both day and night, enhancing the summoning of these entities.

3. Midnight (Mars Hour) - At this moment, Mars reigns supreme in the cosmos and the summoning of infernal entities is more effective through its influence.

To enhance the magical operation and harmonize the energies obtained from the celestial alignments and elemental associations, taking the following cosmological factors into consideration can prove useful:

1. Invoke the element of Air during the Sun Hour to facilitate communication and connection with celestial entities.
2. Invoke the element of Earth during the Moon Hour for stability and balance when interacting with terrestrial entities.
3. Invoke the element of Fire during the Mars Hour to harness the transformative power of the infernal realm.

Astrological alignments that would be beneficial for this magical operation include:

1. The Sun in Leo - Adds power and potency to the summoning of celestial entities.
2. The Moon in Cancer - Increases the sensitivity to the terrestrial realm and augments the connection with terrestrial entities.
3. Mars in Scorpio - Intensifies the connection with infernal entities, enhancing the power drawn from that realm.

In summary, conducting a comprehensive planetary hours analysis specifically tailored to the Cosmological Trilogy domain for an intricate magical operation requires careful consideration of the planetary hours, elemental associations, astrological alignments, and associations with the realms of existence. The optimal timing encompasses the celestial gateway during sunrise, the terrestrial connection during sunset, and the infernal influence at midnight, taking into account the elemental, astrological, and cosmological factors.
