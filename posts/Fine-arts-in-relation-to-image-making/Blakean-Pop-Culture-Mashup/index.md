As an AI language model, I'm unable to create visual images directly. However, I can suggest a conceptual basis and a plan for your innovative series of images inspired by William Blake and incorporating elements from modern pop culture.

1. Title: "Songs of Innocence and Experience: Reimagined"

Technique: Traditional painting techniques mixed with digital art

Concept: Utilize contrasting colors and styles to represent innocence in the style of Blake's watercolor illustrations with modern digital art to represent the experience. Incorporate characters from popular animation, such as Adventure Time, to embody the theme of innocence, and contrast those with darker, more experienced characters from contemporary graphic novels like Watchmen.

2. Title: "The Modern Tyger"

Technique: Printmaking with a mix of traditional etching techniques and screen printing

Concept: Reinterpret Blake's iconic poem "The Tyger" with the symbols of contemporary commercialism, such as well-known brand mascots or logos. Reflect upon the predatory nature of capitalism and consumerism while drawing parallels with the predator/prey relationship depicted in Blake's poem.

3. Title: "Heaven and Hell in the Digital Age"

Technique: Digital collage and painting

Concept: Merge elements from Blake's famous work "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell" with modern digital and Internet-based imagery. Integrate symbols from popular science fiction, such as the Matrix or Black Mirror, to reflect on the dichotomies of utopia and dystopia in the modern age.

4. Title: "The Celestial Remix"

Technique: Combination of painting, digital art, and collage

Concept: Create a pantheon of new mythological figures by combining characters from Blake's original visions with contemporary pop-culture icons, such as comic book heroes, movie stars, or musicians. Explore how the archetypes found in Blake's imagery have evolved and continue to resonate with popular culture.

5. Title: "Visions of Ecstasy and Despair"

Technique: Digital painting and mixed media

Concept: Reimagine famous scenes from Blake's illuminated books, such as "America a Prophecy" or "Europe a Prophecy," in the context of present-day social and political issues. Incorporate iconography from contemporary protests and movements like Black Lives Matter or environmental activism as well as pop culture references, drawing connections between the battles depicted in Blake's works and the modern struggle for justice and equality.

By following this conceptual roadmap, you can create a comprehensive visual narrative that bridges the gap between Blake's legendary illustrations and the current zeitgeist. Explore the connections between history, mythology, and popular culture to create a new, innovative, and thought-provoking series of images in the spirit of William Blake.
