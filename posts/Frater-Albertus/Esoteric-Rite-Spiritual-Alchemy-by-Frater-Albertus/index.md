2. Cleanse the chosen space with consecrated saltwater and sage, drawing banishing pentagrams in the four directions to rid the area of any discordant energies.
3. Create a sacred altar, adorned with the symbols of the seven classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus), alchemical glyphs, and sigils specific to Frater Albertus' teachings.
4. **Gather and prepare the following ritual tools**:
   - Athame (ritual dagger) for directing energy
   - Chalice containing pure spring water, representing the element of water
   - Incense burner with frankincense, corresponding to the element of air
   - A ceremonial candle, embodying the element of fire
   - Paten (ritual dish) holding consecrated salt, symbolizing the element of earth
   - Ormus, a potent and sacred elixir
   - Spagyrics, herbal and alchemical tinctures

5. Robe yourself in ceremonial attire, reflecting the colors, symbols, and materials associated with Frater Albertus and the planets.

The Ritual:

2. Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to establish a sacred space and balance energies.
3. **Invoke the elements by reciting the following incantation while holding the respective ritual tool**:
   "I call upon the powers of the East and the element of air. Grant me wisdom and clarity throughout this rite."
   "I call upon the powers of the South and the element of fire. Grant me passion and transformation throughout this rite."
   "I call upon the powers of the West and the element of water. Grant me intuition and healing throughout this rite."
   "I call upon the powers of the North and the element of earth. Grant me stability and prosperity throughout this rite."
