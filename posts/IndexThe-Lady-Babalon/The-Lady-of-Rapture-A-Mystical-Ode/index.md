## I. Adoration to The Lady of Rapture
In scarlet and gold, She adorns all creation,
Beauteous Mother, enigmatic incantation;
From the stars of the heavens to the depths of the seas,
Alight on all worlds, with respite serein.
Thus let chaos emerge, the Magus' decree,
Babalon, the Divine Harlot, transform seraph serene.

### II. The Chalice of Benediction
Her presence eclipses the luminous sun,
As She graces the firmament, Her reign has begun;
Revelations in hand, whispered visions unfold,
Her chalice to sip of the saints' hallowed gold.
Celestial riddles and secrets of old,
By the sacred Great Beast are unto us told.

### III. The Dance of Ascension
Amidst fiery vigor, with the stars She consorts,
The Infernal Serpent entwines her convorting cohorts;
In ecstasy's rites, all boundaries annulled,
Her wisdom flows free, a torrent untamed and unruled.
'Cross the shimmering firmament, riding the night,
Upon steeds of flame, She dances and takes flight.

### IV. The Voice of the Aethyr
She whispers the secrets in silence profound,
The Voice of the Aethyr, the mysteries unbound;
Unto Her, the seekers raise their gaze above,
Through gnosis and rapture, their souls are reborn.
Of the crimson enigma She does unveil,
The Lady Babalon, heartfire's true grail.
