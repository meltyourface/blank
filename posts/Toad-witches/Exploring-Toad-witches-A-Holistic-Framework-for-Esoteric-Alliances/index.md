In order to provide a comprehensive answer to this question, we must first examine each component of the enquiry: the historical, metaphysical, and symbolic aspects of Toad-witches. Through this exploration, we can better understand the connections and distinctions between these three dimensions of Toad-witches and develop a coherent framework that illuminates the holistic significance of these esoteric creatures.

Historical Aspects:
Examining historical texts and accounts, we find that Toad-witches can be traced back to various ancient civilizations and indigenous cultures, who perceived these amphibious beings as possessing mystical powers. In many cases, toads were held to be the familiars of witches or embodied the witches themselves. For instance, in European folklore, Toad-witches were often linked with harmful spellwork, ill-wishing, and transformation, while in East Asian traditions, the warty amphibians were sometimes revered for their perceived abilities to grant wisdom and longevity.

Metaphysical Aspects:
Metaphysically, the amphibious nature of Toad-witches, being both of land and water, serves as a potent symbol of liminality and transformation. This duality can be understood as a reflection of the interplay between consciousness (land) and unconsciousness (water), and the potential for growth and transformation that lies at the intersection of these two states.

Toad-witches are believed by many to reside at the boundaries of reality and the supernatural, allowing them to tap into the arcane knowledge and psychic abilities that are concealed from most mortals. Those initiates who wish to forge alliances with Toad-witches may seek to access these liminal spaces, whether through altered states of consciousness, magical rituals, dream work, or other means of exploring the liminal realms.

Symbolic Aspects:
Symbolically, Toad-witches carry rich and varied meanings across different cultures and beliefs. For some, they connote fertility and abundance, owing to the large number of eggs laid by female toads, while others associate them with rebirth, transformation, and connection to hidden, primeval wisdom. In alchemy, the toad is a symbol of the prima materia, the raw, chaotic material from which all other elements are derived. 

By synthesizing these elements, we can develop a framework that positions Toad-witches as powerful entities that bridge the metaphysical and symbolic realms while offering valuable insights and occult alliances for initiates. 

1. **Acknowledge the amphibious nature of Toad-witches**: By understanding and embracing the fluidity and liminality of these creatures, initiates can better appreciate the unique perspective these entities offer on the interconnectedness of all reality.

2. **Investigate historical accounts and cross-cultural representations**: Develop a broader understanding of the diverse roles and associations of Toad-witches in various cultural contexts, beliefs, and practices, in order to identify common threads and subtle nuances.

3. Engage with metaphysical practices, rituals, or experiences: By immersing oneself in liminal states that explore the intersections between consciousness and unconsciousness, the initiate can potentially access the hidden realms where Toad-witches are believed to dwell and forge powerful supernatural alliances.

4. **Apply symbolism and allegorical connections**: Observing how Toad-witches reflect themes of fertility, transformation, and arcane wisdom, initiates can begin to apply these insights to personal and spiritual growth, deepening their own understanding and connections to the mystical realm.

In summary, an esoteric framework that synthesizes the historical, metaphysical, and symbolic aspects of Toad-witches involves acknowledging their amphibious nature, embracing cross-cultural representations, engaging with rituals and metaphysical practices, and applying symbolism to personal growth and learnings. By doing so, the initiate can foster a relationship with these enigmatic beings and tap into the wellspring of hidden knowledge and wisdom they hold, thereby transforming their own lives and deepening their understanding of the esoteric world.
