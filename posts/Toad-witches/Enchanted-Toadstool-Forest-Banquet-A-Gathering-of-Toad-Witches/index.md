  Design an elaborate banquet for a gathering of distinguished Toad-witches from various covens, meticulously crafting a sumptuous menu and incorporating intricate ritualistic activities that highlight the unique abilities and knowledge of Toad-witchcraft. The feast should consist of at least five courses, utilizing rare and exotic ingredients, as well as potions and brews infused with toad essence, attentive to the distinct tastes and preferences of the attending Toad-witches. Detail the preparation methods for each dish and ensure the incorporation of magical herbs and spices for added potency. In addition, devise a series of engaging ritual activities that feature Toad-witch traditions, such as spellcasting competitions, toad transformation rituals, and energy-channeling demonstrations, all intended to further strengthen the bonds between covens and foster an atmosphere of collaboration and shared wisdom.

Banquet Theme: The Enchanted Toadstool Forest

Welcome to the enchanted toadstool forest, where our distinguished Toad-witches gather for a night of feasting, rituals, and magic. May the bonds between our covens grow stronger and our knowledge deepen as we indulge in this exquisite feast.

**Menu**:

1. **First Course**: Forest Floor Canapés
A medley of wild mushrooms, truffles, and forest greens, served on crispy toad-leg crackers. The mushrooms are sautéed in toad sweat-infused butter with a hint of enchanted thyme, which amplifies their earthy flavors and enhances psychic abilities.

2. **Second Course**: Blooming Lily Pad Soup
A delicate spring pea soup infused with toad oil, poured over a foundation of fragrant water lily petals. Addition of magical herbs, such as moonwort, ensures that every spoonful heightens the senses, opening the mind to the energies surrounding the banquet.

3. **Third Course**: Celestial Salamander Salad
Tender salamander fillets from faraway marshlands are marinated in starlit swamp elixir, then grilled to perfection. This celestial delicacy is served over a mixed bed of enchanted watercress, rainbow lotus root, and moon-glow sprouts, drizzled with a potion-infused balsamic reduction to deepen intuition.

4. **Fourth Course**: Toad Transmutation Stew
A hearty stew featuring a succulent toad leg, slow-cooked in a broth rich with magical herbs and spices, including the rare bloodroot, mystic mandrake, and witches' sage. Each bite restores energy and attunes the diners to the essence of toad, preparing them for the transformation rituals later in the night.

5. **Fifth Course**: Enchanted Swamp Tiramisu
A delightful and indulgent dessert made with layers of spongy marshmallow cake soaked in black bog liqueur, interlaced with coffee-grains-infused toad mousse, and dusted with enchanted cocoa powder. This sweet conclusion ensures a lasting connection to the energy channels established during the feast.

Ritual Activities:

1. Spellcasting Competition
A friendly test of skill displaying each Toad-witch's mastery over potions, enchantments, and charms. Covens display their unique techniques and knowledge, which in turn serve as learning opportunities for other practitioners.

2. Toad Transformation Rituals
A spotlight on the signature transformation skill of the Toad-witches. Each witch takes turns demonstrating their art of shape-shifting into toads or summoning a personal toad familiar. The exchange of tips and tricks helps to refine their abilities.

3. Energy-Channeling Demonstrations
Toad-witches take turns guiding their fellow practitioners through energy-channeling exercises, showcasing their ability to tap into the spiritual energies present at the banquet. These shared experiences forge a lasting connection between the covens.

Through this grand banquet and these engaging ritual activities, the attending Toad-witches will deepen their knowledge, strengthen their bonds, and foster collaboration, ultimately enhancing the world of Toad-witchcraft.
