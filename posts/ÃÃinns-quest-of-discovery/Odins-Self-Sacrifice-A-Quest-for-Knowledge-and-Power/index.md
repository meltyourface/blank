Hypothesis: Óðinn's decision to embark on a journey of self-sacrifice can be traced back to his insatiable thirst for knowledge, his pursuit of power, and a desire to aid his fellow gods and mankind. To understand Óðinn's motives, we shall examine historical and mythological contextual evidence, as well as interpretative symbols and archetypes.

1. Thirst for Knowledge:
Óðinn was a seeker of wisdom and knowledge, demonstrated by his willingness to sacrifice an eye in exchange for a drink from the well of wisdom, guarded by the giant Mimir. This sacrifice allowed Óðinn to gain knowledge of the past, present, and possible future. Further evidence of his quest for knowledge can be found in his relentless pursuit of the mead of poetry, which grants its consumer poetic and intellectual abilities. Historical references to Óðinn's pursuit of knowledge can be seen in the poem Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. Archetypally, Óðinn represents the wise old man figure and the shaman, with his knowledge of runes and magic.

2. Pursuit of Power:
Óðinn's journey can be interpreted as an attempt to acquire power and maintain his position as the chief of the Norse gods. In Norse mythology, there is a recurring theme of acquiring power through sacrifice. Óðinn's self-sacrifice, when he hung himself from the world tree Yggdrasil for nine days and nights without food or water, resulted in his discovery of runes and their magics. This act symbolizes a rebirth of Óðinn as a more potent figure with even greater knowledge and power. Historically, this concept is present in the ritual sacrifices of the ancient Nordic societies, where they believed sacral kingship granted both mundane and transcendent power. The archetype of the self-sacrificing god to gain power is not unique to Óðinn, as it can be seen in various mythologies around the world.

3. Desire to Aid Gods and Mankind:
Óðinn's decision to embark on a journey of self-sacrifice was at least partially motivated by his devotion to the well-being of the gods and mankind. The knowledge Óðinn obtained and the power he gained allowed him to better understand and protect the world in which the gods and mankind inhabited. For instance, Óðinn used his newly gained wisdom to create the first man and woman, Ask and Embla, ultimately presiding over mankind in the realm of Midgard. Norse mythological texts, such as the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson, detail Óðinn's active role in governing and shaping the world for the greater good of gods and mankind. This divine responsibility is indicative of his desire to engage in a journey of self-sacrifice. Here, Óðinn embodies the benevolent ruler archetype who makes personal sacrifices for the greater good, putting the needs of others before his own. 

In conclusion, Óðinn's decision to embark on a self-sacrificial journey is motivated by his thirst for knowledge, pursuit of power, and a desire to aid his fellow gods and mankind. To fully comprehend his motives, the historical and mythological contexts must be examined, supplemented by an analysis of symbols and archetypes that contribute to the complexity of his character and actions.
