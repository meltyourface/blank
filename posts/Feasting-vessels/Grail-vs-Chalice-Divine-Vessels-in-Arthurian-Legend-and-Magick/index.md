To answer this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the context and origins of both the Grail in Arthurian legend and the Chalice in ceremonial magick. We will then address the distinctions and similarities between their roles and symbolism. Finally, we will identify a cultural feasting vessel that embodies these esoteric concepts and analyze its significance in its own tradition. 

### I. Grail in Arthurian Legend
The Grail is a prominent element in the Arthurian legends, particularly associated with the quest for the Holy Grail. It's believed to be a representation of divine grace and the means of accessing the Christian mysteries. It is often portrayed as a dish or a cup, sometimes with miraculous powers that provide sustenance, healing, and even rejuvenation. The legends surrounding the Grail have evolved over time, although the theme of spiritual transformation and the search for enlightenment remains constant.

A popular interpretation of the Grail myth connects it with the Last Supper and the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. According to this version, Joseph of Arimathea used the Grail to collect the blood of Christ at the Crucifixion and then brought it to Britain, where it became an object of veneration. In this context, the Grail is seen as the ultimate embodiment of spiritual wisdom, truth, and divine revelation.

### II. Chalice in Ceremonial Magick
The Chalice is a key ritual tool in ceremonial magick, especially in western esoteric traditions such as the Golden Dawn, Thelema, and Wicca. It is a sacred vessel, usually made of metal, glass or ceramic, that represents the feminine principle, the Water element, and the subconscious mind. In magickal ceremonies, the Chalice is used to hold consecrated water or wine, symbolizing the transformative powers of the feminine principle in the creative process.

Besides its elemental association with Water, the Chalice also embodies the concept of receptivity. This can be understood as the practitioner's readiness to receive divine guidance and wisdom through their spiritual journey. In many traditions, the Chalice is also related to the Tarot card of the Cups suit, which emphasizes the emotional, intuitive, and psychic aspects of human experience.

### III. Comparison of Grail and Chalice
Similarities:
1. Both the Grail and the Chalice are symbolic of divine wisdom and spiritual transformation.
2. Both objects have been associated with miracles, healing, and rejuvenation.
3. Their roles as sacred vessels emphasize the importance of receptivity, be it to divine grace, intuitive insights, or spiritual wisdom.

Differences:
1. The Grail's origins are rooted in Arthurian and Christian mythology, while the Chalice is a staple of ceremonial magick and various western esoteric traditions.
2. The Grail is primarily linked to the quest for enlightenment, whereas the Chalice serves as a functional ceremonial tool.

### IV. Cultural Feasting Vessel: Mesoamerican Maya Ballgame Vessel
The Maya Ballgame Vessel is a fascinating example of a cultural feasting object embodying esoteric concepts resonant with those found in the Grail and Chalice. The ballgame played a central role in Mesoamerican cultures, with both religious and political implications. The vessel, typically made from pottery or ceramic, was used during feasting ceremonies associated with the ballgame, where food and drink were shared as part of the ritual activities.

The ballgame was thought to symbolize the cosmic struggle between life and death, and the ballcourt functioned as a liminal space between the earthly realm and the divine. The Maya Ballgame Vessel, in this context, served as a sacred container for the sustenance necessary in these highly charged ceremonial events. It embodies the transformative and spiritual concepts parallel to those of the Grail and the Chalice.

### V. Conclusion
The Grail in Arthurian legend and the Chalice in ceremonial magick, despite their distinct origins, share profound similarities in terms of symbolism and esoteric themes. Both objects represent divine wisdom, spiritual transformation, and the importance of receptivity. The Maya Ballgame Vessel, as a cultural feasting object, echoes these themes and further emphasizes the global resonance of the human quest for enlightenment and spiritual transformation.
