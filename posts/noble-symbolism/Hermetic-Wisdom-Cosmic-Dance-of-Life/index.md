description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, noble symbolism, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a reverential sonnet dedicated to the illustrious alchemist Hermes Trismegistus, incorporating quintessential symbols such as the Emerald Tablet, the caduceus, and the all-encompassing Hermetic principles. Emphasize the relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm, while skillfully employing intricate allegory and nuanced metaphor to convey the profound essence of the Great Work.

Upon the verdant stone of wisdom's mount,
Emerald mystery doth Hermetic sky enthrall,
In sacred hands, Trismegistus' bount
Deciphers truths which mortal eyes appall.

Thy caduceus, as serpents twine, reveals
Eternal dance of life's enigmatic coil
In harmony with cosmic rhythm, seals
Earth's hidden force that lies beneath the soil.

The macrocosm—galaxies by twain, entwine—
Reflecting man's journey through mirrored night,
The microcosmic Self dost alchemy refine,
Reclaiming oneness, as above, so right.

O Hermes, guide us to the Great Work's seal,
Transmute our souls to gold with virtuous zeal.
