## The Rite of Emotional Mending

### I. Setup and Preparation:
1. Choose a suitable location, preferably a quiet, sacred space, where you can perform the ritual undisturbed.
2. Cleanse and purify the space using a blend of sage, lavender, and chamomile essential oils. Create a circle using sea salt, large enough for you to sit comfortably within.
3. Set up the main altar within the circle, facing the direction of the Moon (North or East, depending on the time of the lunar cycle), with a focus on the following:
   a. A bowl of moonwater, or water charged by the light of a Full Moon, symbolizing emotional healing.
   b. A representation of the Moon (illustration, photograph, or carved symbol).
   c. An assortment of crystals, specifically rose quartz (promotes love and emotional healing), amethyst (calms the mind and raises spiritual vibration), and selenite (healing and spiritual growth).

### II. Lunar Phase and Timing:
Perform the ritual on the night of a Full Moon, as this phase aligns with the energy of emotional release and healing. The Full Moon's energy will help you to release emotional pain and promote self-awareness and compassion.

### III. Sigils, Symbols, and Correspondences:
a. Design a unique sigil which represents emotional healing and inner peace. Incorporate symbols such as hearts, spirals, and lunar elements. While creating the sigil, keep your intent firmly fixed in your mind.
b. Using the sigil you've drawn, inscribe it onto a white or silver candle which will serve as the centerpiece for the ritual.
c. Drape yourself in an outfit or robe adorned with lunar symbols, such as crescent moons or stars.

### IV. Performing the Ritual:
1. Begin with a centering meditation to ground yourself, focusing on your breath and the feeling of the earth beneath you.
2. Ignite the sigil-inscribed candle while reciting the following chant:

   "In the glow of Luna's light,
    I call upon her healing might.
    From darkness, pain will subside,
    As love and peace now fill my mind."

3. Hold each crystal in your hand, one at a time, while visualizing the healing energy of the Full Moon infusing with the specific properties of the crystal. As you hold each one, intone the following incantation:

  "Moonlit beauty, power divine,
   Let my heart and soul align.
   With (crystal's property) instilled,
   May this (type of crystal) fulfill."

4. Anoint yourself with a few drops of the essential oil blend mixed with the moonwater, focusing on your heart area, temples, and wrists. Speak the following affirmation as you do so:

   "I am open to healing, love, and light.
    I release my pain into the night.
    Emotions mended, heart now free,
    A new beginning now for me."

5. Meditate on your intention of emotional healing, visualizing the Moon's light pouring into, cleansing, and mending your heart. Allow the sigil-inscribed candle to burn down completely, signaling the completion of the ritual.

6. Once the ritual is complete, bury the wax remnants, any remaining moonwater, and the sea salt from the circle in the earth, symbolizing your release of the emotional wounds. Keep the crystals close to you, as a reminder of your healing and inner peace.

Practicing this ritual with the mastery of occult forces will initiate a potent healing spell, designed to mend emotional wounds and promote inner peace. Remember, true emotional healing is a gradual process, and this ritual will aid you in that journey.
