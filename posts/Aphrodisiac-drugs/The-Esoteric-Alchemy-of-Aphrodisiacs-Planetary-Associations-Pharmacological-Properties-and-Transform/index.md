Answer:

The historical use of occultism and esotericism play a significant role in the context of aphrodisiac drugs. In order to grasp the intricate web of connections between the principles of alchemy, planetary associations, pharmacological properties, and psychological implications in aphrodisiacs, several factors need to be scrutinized. This answer will closely examine each of these aspects while highlighting the transformative experiences of the initiate throughout the process.

### I. Principles of Alchemy

Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that aimed to transform base metals into noble ones, specifically gold. It also sought to discover a universal panacea and an elixir of life, which could allegedly bestow immortality. Fundamental concepts in alchemy include exploring the relationship between spirit, soul, and body, as well as understanding the nature of reality and harnessing the power within it. This understanding encompasses various aspects through which an initiate could recognize the influence of alchemy on the use of aphrodisiacs.

A. **The four elements**: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire
These elements are foundational to the principles of alchemy and serve as important components of various aphrodisiacs. By understanding their properties, alchemists combined these elements to create a balanced mixture of aphrodisiac substances.

B. **The three principles**: Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury
These principles also constitute an essential aspect of alchemical tradition. They respectively represent the physical, spiritual, and mental aspects of substances. By manipulating these principles, alchemists aimed to enhance and maximize the potential of the aphrodisiac.

### II. Planetary Associations

In esoteric and occult traditions, each planet is believed to be associated with specific traits, energies, and symbolic meanings. The understanding of planetary correspondences played an essential role in the selection and preparation of certain aphrodisiac substances.

A. Planets and their correspondence to aphrodisiacs
For example, Venus is the planet associated with love, beauty, passion, and fertility. Therefore, substances with these attributes are considered as potent aphrodisiacs. Similarly, Mars represents strength and courage, while Mercury stands for intelligence and communication. These planetary associations dictated the choice and use of different substances in concocting aphrodisiac drugs.

B. Astrological timing
The timing of administering aphrodisiacs was also determined by planetary configurations and zodiac signs. Certain calendar periods were believed to be more conducive for successes in love and sexual pursuits, thus playing a vital role in the use of aphrodisiac substances.

### III. Pharmacological Properties

The integration of alchemy and planetary associations with pharmacological properties was vital in enhancing the potential of the chosen aphrodisiacs. Alchemists used their knowledge of plants, minerals, and animals, which were believed to possess specific energies that correlated with the principles of alchemy and planetary associations, to create powerful aphrodisiac mixtures.

A. Herbal remedies
Some notable examples include the use of yohimbine, ginseng, saffron, and various other herbs to stir and enhance sexual desires.

B. Mineral constituents
Likewise, the use of minerals such as pearl, gold, and oyster shells have been added to aphrodisiac blends to increase their potency.

C. Animal derivatives
There are also instances of using animal parts, such as rhinoceros horns and tiger penises, which were believed to possess sexual prowess.

### IV. Psychological Implications and Transformative Experiences

The holistic understanding and application of aphrodisiacs in esoteric and occult practices are intricately connected to enhancing the psychological and transformative experiences of the initiate.

A. Expectation and belief
The expectation and belief in the efficacy of aphrodisiacs led to an overall heightened experience caused by the anticipation of the substance's effects. These psychological responses, in turn, may induce physiological responses contributing to the experience.

B. Symbolic representations
The symbolic connections between the aphrodisiac and the desired effect could create deep psychological impacts on the user. Through associations with powerful symbols, aphrodisiacs are capable of invoking transformative experiences for the initiate.

In conclusion, the historical use of occultism and esotericism in aphrodisiac drugs is a complex and fascinating subject. The principles of alchemy, planetary associations, pharmacological properties of substances, and psychological implications are deeply interconnected and form an intricate system for understanding, formulating, and administering potent aphrodisiacs. By acknowledging and exploring these aspects, one can develop a deeper appreciation of the transformative experiences an initiate can seek through the use of aphrodisiacs in esoteric and occult practices.
