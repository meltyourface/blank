## The Astrum Argenteum (A.A.): Core Principles, Practices, and Spiritual Development



1. **Origins of the Astrum Argenteum**

The Astrum Argenteum, or A.A., is a mystical organization founded in 1907 by the renowned occultist Aleister Crowley. This order came into being as an extension and reformation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which predominantly focused on ceremonial magic and spiritual development. The A.A. was established to guide its members on a path of self-discovery and spiritual enlightenment based on Crowley's system of Thelema, as well as the principles and practices of various religious, magical, and philosophical traditions. In essence, the A.A. encourages individuals to discover and fulfill their True Will, the ultimate purpose of their lives.



2. Main Teachings of the A.A.

The A.A. embodies a synthesis of diverse esoteric teachings, primarily drawing from the Western magical traditions, including Kabbalah, ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, and Thelema. Central to its doctrine is the belief that every individual has a True Will, a unique and divine purpose, which must be sought and followed diligently. The primary goal of the A.A. is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, an experience of direct communion with one's higher self or divine guardian.

A key axiom of the A.A. is "As above, so below," reflecting the concept that every macrocosmic event is mirrored in the microcosm of human consciousness. Consequently, the initiates work on self-improvement to not only benefit themselves but also contribute positively to the world around them.



3. **Grades and Levels of Initiation**

The A.A. divides the process of spiritual development into three distinct orders, with each order comprised of individual grades or steps:

### I. **The Order of the Golden Dawn**:
- Neophyte (0°)
- Zelator (1°)
- Practicus (2°)
- Philosophus (3°)

### II. **The Order of the Rosy Cross**:
- Adeptus Minor (5°)
- Adeptus Major (6°)
- Adeptus Exemptus (7°)

### III. **The Order of the Silver Star**:
- Babe of the Abyss (encounter with the Abyss)
- Magister Templi (8°)
- Magus (9°)
- Ipsissimus (10°)

Each grade represents a specific stage in the student's spiritual development and is associated with particular knowledge, magical practices, and personal insights. One progresses through these grades via a combination of instruction, study, self-examination, and ritual work. The ultimate goal is self-mastery and unity with the divine.



4. **Practical Example of a Spiritual Exercise**: The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)

A fundamental spiritual exercise practiced within the A.A.—and the Western magical tradition as a whole—is the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP). As a Neophyte exercise, the LBRP serves to cleanse one's ritual space and strengthen the initiate's consciousness and willpower.

Here is an overview of the LBRP:

1. Stand facing east, assume the Qabalistic Cross posture. Firmly visualize yourself as the direct center of the universe.
2. Recite the Qabalistic Cross, drawing energy from above, downward, and then from the right, ending at the left shoulder.
3. Circumambulate the space, imagining a circle of divine light forming around it.
4. Facing east, draw a banishing Earth pentagram and intone the Divine Name, "YHVH." Repeat the process for the other cardinal directions, using the appropriate Divine Names: ADNI (south), AHIH (west), and AGLA (north).
5. Invoke the Archangels Raphael (east), Michael (south), Gabriel (west), and Uriel (north) and acknowledge their presence.
6. Close with the Qabalistic Cross again.

Through regular practice, the LBRP not only prepares the initiate for further magical work but also trains their mind and will in the art of visualizing and directing energy.



In summary, the Astrum Argenteum is a mystical organization founded by Aleister Crowley, with the primary goal being the discovery and fulfillment of one's True Will. Through a structured system of teachings, rituals, and graded initiations, students are guided on a personal journey of spiritual development and self-mastery. Exercises such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram play a crucial role in attaining the skillset and understanding needed for this inner growth.
