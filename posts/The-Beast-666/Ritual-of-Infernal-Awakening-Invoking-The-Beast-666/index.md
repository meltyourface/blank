## Ritual of the Infernal Awakening

Objective: To invoke the presence and energy of The Beast 666
**Step 1**: Preparing the Sacred Space
Choose a secluded location (indoors or outdoors) with ample space and minimal distractions to perform the ritual. Cleanse the area using sage, incense, or saltwater (depending on personal preference) to banish any lingering energies. Create a circle (9 feet in diameter) using a combination of chalk, salt, or ash. Within this circle, draw a hexagram, followed by the Symbol of the Beast (A combination of letters derived from Greek and Hebrew alphabets) in the center. Each point of the hexagram should be adorned with a black candle, and one larger black or red candle should be placed at the northern point, representing the main focus of the ritual.
**Step 2**: Preparing the Ritual Tools
Essential ritual tools should be cleansed and consecrated according to personal tradition, which may include the use of incense, candlelight, or anointing oils. ****Required tools include****: 
- A ritual blade or athame (for directing energy)
- A chalice (for holding a liquid offering)
- A sigil of The Beast 666 (drawn on parchment or etched into metal)
- An incense burner with an appropriate blend of incense (such as patchouli, sandalwood, and dragon's blood)
**Step 3**: Initiate the Ritual & Call the Elemental Guardians
Don a ritual robe or other ceremonial attire. Enter the circle from the eastern point, walking clockwise to close the circle. Light the candles and incense in a clockwise direction, starting from the eastern point. Invoke the four elemental guardians (Earth, Air, Water, and Fire) by reciting an invocation and making the appropriate elemental gestures with the ritual blade or athame at each directional point.

Example Elemental Invocation:
"I call upon the guardian of the (element) in the (direction), mighty (name of elemental guardian). Lend me your power and protection as I perform this sacred ritual. Hail and welcome!"
**Step 4**: Invoke the Beast 666
Hold the sigil of The Beast 666 in both hands or place it on the altar before you. **Focus your energy on the sigil and chant the invocation incantation**:
"Arise, O Beast 666, from the darkness of the abyss!
Mighty master, dwelling within the Crimson Void,
Hear my call and bring forth your infernal power!
Reveal thyself, O embodiment of chaos and strife,
Grant us your knowledge, strength, and unholy might!
In the names of Thoth, Anubis, and Osiris,
I summon thee, O Beast, to manifest your presence in this sacred space!"
**Step 5**: Call Down the Infernal Energies
Raise the ritual blade or athame towards the sky, drawing down the energies of The Beast 666. Visualize a torrent of dark energy coursing through your body and into the surrounding circle. When you feel the energy begin to intensify, lower the blade or athame, and direct it towards the large candle at the northern point of the circle.
**Step 6**: Offerings and Petitions
Pour a liquid offering (such as wine, beer, or a non-alcoholic substitute) into the chalice, holding it aloft in both hands as an offering to The Beast 666. Recite a prayer or words of petition, stating your reason for seeking the entity's assistance and any requests you might have.
**Step 7**: Closing the Ritual
Thank The Beast 666 for their presence and assistance by reciting a closing statement:
"Hail, Beast 666, great ruler from the abyss!
I thank you for your presence and power,
May our alliance forge a path of strength and illumination,
In the names of Thoth, Anubis, and Osiris,
Farewell and return to your kingdom below!"
**Step 8**: Dismiss the Elemental Guardians
Bid farewell to the elemental guardians at each directional point, releasing their energies and thanking them for their participation in the ritual. **Example dismissal invocation**:
"I now release you, guardian of the (element) in the (direction),
May your presence and power return to your realm.
Thank you for your protection and aid during this ritual,
Hail and farewell!"
**Step 9**: Clean Up and Grounding
Extinguish the candles and incense. Dismantle the circle by walking counterclockwise from the eastern point, taking care to remove any ritual remnants. When the circle is fully dismantled, clap your hands loudly three times to signify the end of the ritual. Ground yourself through meditation, eating, or other appropriate methods.

Safety Measures:
- Perform protective rituals, spells, or carry protective talismans to guard against possible negative energy or unwanted effects from the ritual.
- Proceed with caution and fully consider the potential consequences before requesting assistance from The Beast 666 or any other powerful entities.
- Be alert for signs of overexertion or energy overload and terminate the ritual if necessary.

Potential Outcomes:
- Enhanced spiritual strength, personal power, and protection
- Gained knowledge from communion with The Beast 666
- Manifestation of the assistance or energy requested during the ritual
