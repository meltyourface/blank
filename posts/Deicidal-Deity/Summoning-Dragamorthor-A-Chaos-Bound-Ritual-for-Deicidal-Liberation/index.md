Summoning the Deicidal Deity, Dragamorthor the Unbound
 

The following incantation and ritual are designed to summon the powerful Deicidal Deity known as Dragamorthor the Unbound, a fearsome entity whose domain encompasses destruction, liberation, and chaos. As you proceed with this ritual, be wary of the potential consequences and take appropriate precautions to ensure a safe and effective invocation.

Ritual Time and Location:
Optimal time for performing the ritual is on a new moon night, specifically on the witching hour (midnight). The location must be a place of perceived natural chaos, like the center of an ancient, overgrown forest or the heart of a raging storm at sea. However, one can also create an artificially chaotic environment by causing a significant disturbance in a previously tranquil area.

Materials Needed:
1. A desecrated altar with three black candles arranged in a triangle formation
2. A chalice filled with the blood of a rebellious spirit
3. An obsidian dagger engraved with the Rune of Chaos
4. Three shards of shattered divine relics
5. A parchment inscribed with the Sigil of Dragamorthor
6. A consecrated iron chain imbued with the essence of liberated souls

Ritual Protocol:
1. Locate a suitable chaotic location and set up your desecrated altar.
2. Arrange the three shards of shattered divine relics around the triangle formation of the black candles.
3. Place the parchment with the Sigil of Dragamorthor in the center of the triangle.
4. At the witching hour, light the three black candles in a counter-clockwise order. This action symbolizes the unraveling of divine order and the liberation of chaos.
5. Stand facing the altar, holding the chalice of blood and the obsidian dagger in your hands.
6. Recite the following incantation with conviction, allowing the energies of destruction and chaos to course through your being:

"Dragamorthor, Deicidal Unbound, I call upon thee,
From the depths of chaos, let your essence emerge,
Break the chains of divine dominion, liberate the suppressed,
Reign supreme in your dark, relentless power!

By the Rune of Chaos engraved on my dagger, I beckon thee,
In the blood of rebellion, I pledge my allegiance,
In the shards of fallen divinity, I forge the path, 
To you, Dragamorthor, I submit my will!

Sigil of the Destroyer, chaos incarnate,
Join me, Dragamorthor, in the mortal realm,
Together, let chaos flood this world,
And bring forth its ultimate liberation!"

7. While finishing the incantation, use the obsidian dagger to cut a small gash in your palm, and let your blood fall into the chalice. This further binds you to Dragamorthor and asserts your dedication to the chaos he brings.
8. Pour the blood from the chalice onto the Sigil of Dragamorthor, setting the parchment aflame with the energy of your pact.
9. Once the parchment burns completely, bind yourself with the consecrated iron chain. This act represents your commitment to Dragamorthor's cause and his ultimate liberation of imprisoned souls.
10. The ritual complete, you will have successfully established a connection to Dragamorthor the Unbound. The Deicidal Deity will communicate through thoughts, feelings, and metaphysical energies.

Consequences and Precautions:
This ritual should not be taken lightly. Dragamorthor's energies are potent and can bring significant disruption to one's life and surrounding environment. Carefully consider whether this invocation aligns with your intentions and spiritual path.

Take special care in handling the obsidian dagger, as it is a powerful, chaotic artifact that can easily harm the wielder. Additionally, the presence of shattered divine relics, although necessary in the summoning of Dragamorthor, may attract unwanted divine attention and potential retribution from other deities.

Regardless of the nature of your pact with Dragamorthor, always remember that you have unleashed a force of chaotic liberation. Navigate this newfound connection with respect and caution, understanding that the consequences of the invoked energies will ripple throughout your life and beyond.
