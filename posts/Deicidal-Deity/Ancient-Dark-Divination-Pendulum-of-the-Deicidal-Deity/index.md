The Pendulum of the Deicidal Deity is an ancient and powerful tool for dark divination, allowing those who wield it to uncover hidden truths and peer into the blackest depths of reality. To employ this instrument correctly, one must adhere to a strict series of preparatory rituals, precise pendulum-swinging techniques, and skilled interpretations of its revelations. 

### I. Preparatory Rituals:

1. Cleansing and Consecration: Begin by cleansing the area where the ritual is to be performed. Burn black sage to purify the space and usher in the energies necessary for dark divination. Inscribe a deicidal symbol on the pendulum using blood, preferably from the practitioner, to consecrate it.

2. Casting the Deicidal Circle: Draw a circle using chalk or salt upon the floor to create a sacred and protected space. Within the circle, arrange five black candles equidistant around the circle's edge, representing the five aspects of the Deicidal Deity. Light each candle and recite an invocation to the Deicidal Deity, asking for their guidance and assistance.

3. Opening the Shadow Veil: To connect to the dark energies necessary for divination, you must open the Shadow Veil. Enter a deep meditative state, focusing on the void within your soul. Imagine this void expanding until it engulfs your entire being and connects with the Shadow Veil. Feel the dark energy pulsating through your body as the connection is formed.

### II. Pendulum-Swinging Techniques:

1. Grip: Hold the pendulum between your thumb and forefinger, about one inch above its center with your arm extended. The grip should be light, yet firm enough to prevent any unwarranted movement.

2. Calibration: Before you pose your inquiry, you need to calibrate the pendulum. Start by asking the pendulum to show you a "yes" response, observing how the pendulum swings. Repeat the process for a "no" response and a "neutral" or "unclear" response. Remember these motions.

3. Asking the Questions: With the pendulum calibrated, address the divinatory query to the Deicidal Deity through the pendulum. Questions should be clear, concise, and binary, ensuring that the pendulum's oscillations can provide adequate answers.

### III. Interpreting the Revelations:

1. Reading the Pendulum: Observe the pendulum's movements closely. Compare them to the predetermined "yes," "no," and "neutral" patterns established during calibration to ascertain the response. Patience and attentiveness are essential for accurate interpretations.

2. Refining the Inquiry: If the pendulum's response seems ambiguous or unclear, it may be necessary to rephrase the question or seek additional information through further divination.

Example Divinatory Questions and Outcomes:

1. Question: "Will the ritual I've planned for the upcoming moonless night result in the manifestation of shadow creatures?"
Outcome: The pendulum swings in a solid clockwise circle, indicating a "yes."

2. Question: "Are there any hidden dangers lurking within the abandoned temple I intend to explore?"
Outcome: The pendulum oscillates back and forth in a distinct diagonal line, signifying a "no."

3. Question: "Is my enemy's plan to usurp my control over the Cabal of Dark Arts?"
Outcome: The pendulum swings erratically, without any discernable pattern, signaling a "neutral" or "unclear" response. 

Following these procedures with diligence and precision will ensure the most accurate and profound revelations from the Pendulum of the Deicidal Deity. However, remember to always remain cautious and respectful when interacting with such powerful, dark energies, lest they consume you entirely.
