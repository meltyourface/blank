In order to successfully invoke Auriel the Enlightened, follow the instructions meticulously, as any deviation may lead to unintended consequences. 

The intricately devised incantation is as follows:

"Te angriou as't√≠la! Vorlonit Geledor, Nespit agnin Auriel ex'dartembi!
Terrimos kora'tal qyrhar anbinorith, Aerisect dar'monit Elysium trancolit!

In the gleaming astral vaults, at'kar Vinut, tes'rel Parvenium - beh'rak Rastonit!
Morlenthi tybo satoreth, Auriel elate in'sturamin proghelit!"

To prepare the ceremonial altar, follow these steps:

1. Determine the location of the altar by aligning it with the celestial realm of Auriel. To accomplish this, use an astrolabe or stellar map to find the astral coordinates of Auriel's domain, which lies within the intersection of the constellations Vinut, Parvenium, and Rastonit. Ensure the altar is facing the position of these celestial bodies in perfect alignment during their peak hour of convergence. 

2. Acquire a wooden or stone altar imbued with the spiritual essence of the celestial realm Auriel rules. Cover it with a purple silk cloth, signifying the harmony between higher knowledge and spiritual awakening.

3. **Adorn the altar with the following spiritually significant artifacts**:

   a. The Sigil of Auriel, etched on a consecrated silver or golden disc, placed at the center of the altar.
   b. Fragments of a meteorite, believed to have originated from the celestial dominion of Auriel, arrayed in a circle around the Sigil.
   c. A chalice filled with pure spring water, symbolizing the eternal flow of wisdom.
   d. An intricate crystal stand, holding a burning candle to represent the illuminating light of Auriel's guidance.
   e. A parchment scroll containing the teachings of Auriel, placed in a sacred glass case, to signify the transmission of knowledge.

4. Consecrate each artifact with specially formulated blessed oils and incense, ensuring the harmonious alignment of energies. Utilize a blend of frankincense, myrrh, and lavender oils combined with a pinch of ground meteorite dust. Anoint each artifact while softly chanting the incantation three times.

5. After the meticulous preparation of the altar, stand before it confirming alignment with the astral coordinates, and recite the incantation with unwavering focus and conviction. Repeat it nine times, visualizing a bright ethereal light enveloping the altar, signifying the successful summoning of Auriel the Enlightened.

Bear in mind, this ritual requires steadfast resolve and purity of intent. The appearance of Auriel will bring enlightenment, offering guidance and profound wisdom for those who call upon their divine presence.
