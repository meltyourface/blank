To summon the elemental force of fire in accordance with the principles outlined in the Book of the Concourse of ForcesThe Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage, the following invocation, symbolism, incantations, rituals, and precautions must be employed. It is essential to abide by these guidelines in order to safely control the summoned force.

Materials and Tools:
1. Fireproof ceremonial robe or garment in a suitable color, such as red or orange
2. A ritual dagger or athame
3. A fireproof circle or space in which to conduct the ritual
4. A censor or thurible with charcoal and incense specific to the fire element, such as frankincense or dragon's blood
5. A chalice containing pure water and a sprinkle of sea salt
6. A circular, fireproof symbol of the fire element, such as a large circle with a triangle inscribed within it
7. A ritual wand or staff made of a material associated with fire, such as an iron or copper rod
8. A prepared copy of the invocation written on parchment or another appropriate material

Ceremonial Preparations:
Before beginning the invocation, cleanse and consecrate your ceremonial space. Purify the area with the saltwater and incense smoke, and then cast a circle using the ritual dagger or athame. Place the fireproof symbol of the fire element at the center of the circle, and set up the incense nearby. Position the chalice and wand or staff within easy reach.

Invocation:
With the ceremonial space prepared, don your fireproof robe or garment and enter the circle. Begin the invocation by lighting the incense and allowing the smoke to fill the area. Hold the wand or staff in your dominant hand, and recite the following incantation three times:

"By the powers of Samael, mighty master of fire,
I summon forth the elemental force of flame,
To manifest within this sacred space,
And serve my will for purposes of change and transformation."

Standing before the fireproof symbol, trace the shape of the triangle in the air with the wand or staff in your dominant hand, visualizing a trail of flame following each motion. As you trace the shape, recite the following incantation:

"I invoke the elemental force of fire,
Through the blazing triangle that governs its domain,
Let the infernal flames be controlled and contained,
As my will commands and the spirits obey."

Next, kneel before the fireproof symbol and slowly pour a small amount of the saltwater mixture from the chalice onto the edge of the circle in a clockwise motion, reciting the following incantation:

"By the powers of water, I bind and contain,
The raging inferno summoned in this rite.
Let only harmony and balance remain,
As the intermingling of fire and water ignites."

With the invocation complete, remain within the circle and visualize the elemental force of fire manifesting within the confines of the fireproof symbol, contained and controlled. The summoned energy may now be directed according to your will and intent through the use of the ritual wand or staff.

To close the ritual, thank the elemental force of fire for its presence and assistance, and banish it by reversing the tracing of the triangle with the wand or staff while reciting a dismissal incantation:

"Elemental force of fire, I release and bid farewell,
Return to your realm and heed my command no more,
By the authority of Samael, master of the flame,
I now dissolve the connection, the circle's power to restore."

Following this, extinguish the incense, release the circle, and perform a cleansing ritual to ensure any residual energies are dispelled from your working space.

Note: Working with elemental forces, especially fire, can be dangerous and should not be treated lightly. It is essential to follow the outlined precautions and perform the ritual with the utmost respect and care to prevent any unintended consequences.
