1. **Energetic resonance of I Ching hexagrams in the context of modern psychic and energetic dynamics**:

Each I Ching hexagram represents a unique energetic pattern that can be linked to the current psychic and energetic dynamics experienced by individuals. For example, hexagram 1 - Qian, representing pure yang energy, can be correlated with a surge of motivation, creativity, or self-empowerment in modern times. Similarly, hexagram 2 - Kun, representing pure yin energy, signifies nurturing, receptivity, and introspection.

2. **Nuances of hexagram lines and their connection to modern themes**:

The lines within each hexagram reveal the intricate relationships between various archetypal energies and provide insights into themes prevalent in today's psychic landscape. For example, hexagram 23 - Po (Splitting Apart), signifies a time of dissolution or breaking down of existing structures. In today's context, this could be relevant to personal relationships, political divides, or environmental challenges.

3. **Influence of current astrological alignments**:

Astrological alignments play a role in shaping the interpretations of I Ching hexagrams. For example, a strong Saturn aspect might emphasize the importance of discipline, patience, or responsibility in interpreting the wisdom of a particular hexagram, whereas a prominent Neptune placement could hint at the necessity of tapping into intuition, dreams, or spiritual experiences.

4. **Examples of modern questions and situations for I Ching guidance**:

One example of a modern issue where I Ching can offer valuable guidance is navigating through a major career shift. Hexagram 42 - Yi (Increase) could encourage an individual to embrace the change and capitalize on new opportunities, while Hexagram 64 - Wei Chi (Before Completion) might serve as a reminder of the importance of persevering in the face of challenges and uncertainty.

5. **Multidimensional layers of I Ching hexagrams' symbolism**:

Each I Ching hexagram encompasses multiple layers of meaning tapping into conscious, subconscious, and collective psychic realms. For instance, hexagram 54 - Kuei Mei (The Marrying Maiden) may represent, on a conscious level, the importance of commitment in romantic relationships. On a deeper subconscious level, it could symbolize the need to establish a stronger bond with one's intuition or spiritual guidance. And, on a collective psychic level, it may suggest the necessity of fostering harmonious connections within a community or society at large.

6. **In-depth case study**:

Consider an individual seeking clarity on their spiritual path and feeling a sense of stagnation in their development. Upon consulting the I Ching, they receive hexagram 29 - Kan (The Abysmal Water). This hexagram can serve as a reminder of the importance of confronting fears, embracing the unknown, and pursuing personal growth, no matter how challenging the path may be. Interpreting the lines of this hexagram, they may uncover key areas requiring attention or transformation in their life, such as relinquishing control and learning to trust the flow of life, or finding courage to explore their depths through meditation or therapy. The astrological context at the time of their reading might color their interpretation, such as a strong Pluto alignment suggesting a period of intense transformation through confronting their shadows and embracing profound change.
