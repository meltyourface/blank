The Renaissance period, marked by renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman culture and thought, bore witness to a profound transformation in the field of occult philosophy. As scholars during this time explored various esoteric traditions, Renaissance Neoplatonism emerged as a powerful current that shaped not only the nature of the occult, but also its relationship with other cultural and intellectual movements.

One development central to the evolution of occultism in the Renaissance was the synthesis of Neoplatonic thought with Hermeticism, alchemy, and magic. The fusion of these traditions stemmed in large part from the influence of key figures such as Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, who integrated Neoplatonic ideas into their esoteric work.

Ficino, the prolific Italian philosopher, translated and commented on the works of Neoplatonist philosophers like Plotinus and Proclus, as well as key Hermetic texts like the Corpus Hermeticum. His philosophical endeavors laid the groundwork for the eventual conflation of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, enabling the emergence of an occult tradition that combined philosophical speculation with practical applications.

Pico della Mirandola, a peer of Ficino, further developed these ideas by attempting to reconcile various philosophical, mystical, and magical traditions. His "Oration on the Dignity of Man" is emblematic of the humanistic character of Renaissance Neoplatonism, as it affirms the limitless potential of humanity to attain divine knowledge and explore the mysteries of the cosmos. Alongside Ficino, Pico's thought provided a foundation for the way in which Neoplatonism shaped Renaissance occult practices like alchemy and magic.

Significant texts like the Corpus Hermeticum, Asclepius, and works of Paracelsus also played crucial roles in the development of Renaissance occultism. By synthesizing Neoplatonic ideas with elements of alchemical theory, they not only reinvigorated ancient Hermetic knowledge but also offered new avenues for practical engagement with the material and spiritual realms.

The blending of occult and scientific thought during the Renaissance exemplified the ways in which occult philosophy intersected with other domains of intellectual inquiry. The pursuit of "natural magic," as championed by Ficino and others, sought to harness the hidden principles governing the cosmos in service of both scientific and spiritual ends. As a result, practitioners studied alchemy alongside medicine, and Renaissance artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, experimented with natural magic in their work.

The interweaving of Renaissance occultism with religious thought was equally significant. The Christian Kabbalah that emerged in the period integrated Jewish mystical traditions with Neoplatonic and Hermetic concepts, further contributing to the synthesis of esoteric practices. Moreover, the defense of magic and its relation to divinity by philosophically inclined magicians like Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa greatly impacted the perception of the magical arts.

In conclusion, the impact of Renaissance Neoplatonism on the evolution of occult philosophy is far-reaching and multifaceted, marked by the convergence of Hermeticism, alchemy, and magic. Key figures like Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola played pivotal roles in reshaping Neoplatonic thought and esoteric practices. Additionally, seminal texts like the Corpus Hermeticum and the works of Paracelsus provided the intellectual foundations necessary to advance these subjects. Ultimately, the Renaissance period fostered the intertwining of occultism with scientific, religious, and artistic developments, which paved the way for further advancements in esoteric teachings and practices.
