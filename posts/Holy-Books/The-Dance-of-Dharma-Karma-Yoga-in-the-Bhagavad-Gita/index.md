## The Sublime Dance of Svadharma

### Chapter: The Yoga of Action (Karma Yoga) - Chapter 2

Source Verses: Bhagavad Gita (2.47, 2.50, 2.70)

### I. Invocation

In the mists of ancient yore,
From the everlasting sacred lore,
We delve into the Bhagavad Gita's light,
Fathomless wisdom, transcending the night.

In the Yoga of Action—eternal song,
To Krishna and Arjuna we shall throng,
To weave a tapestry, an opus most grand,
From the second chapter, Karma Yoga's strand.

### II. Curtains Unfolding

Amidst the battle's din in Kurukshetra's land,
Resounds Krishna's divine command,
Seizing Arjuna's mortal strife,
Bespoke eternal truths on Dharma and Life.

"Karmanyeva Adhikaraste, Ma Phaleshu Kadachana"
In this verse lies the pristine path,
To obliterate worldly illusions, relentless wrath.

Action, surrender, detachment enthrall,
Like the cycles of nature, the seasons that fall.

### III. The Gyre of Action

Bound, in the cosmic dance of the flute,
Path charted by Svadharma, soul's pursuit,
Toiling ceaselessly, expect not the fruit,
Nourish creation, manifest the cosmic truth.

"Yogah Karmasu Kaushalam", whispered the Divine,
Yoga, the skillful action—universal design,
Shackles of bondage, desires burn and purge,
Elevate the unwavering soul, on the path, let's converge.

### IV. In the Heart of Stillness

"Apuryamanam achala-prathistham" - verse seventy chimes,
Stillness echoes, beyond space and times,
A soul ascends like a river's graceful flow,
Into the ocean vast, a selfless merge, a celestial glow.

Abode of wisdom, the Gita unfolds,
Unwavering focus, ancient truths it beholds,
The fire of action, Svadharma at its core,
Beyond the temporal, an ethereal rapport.

### V. Triumphant Symphony

In the maelstrom of life, the paths converge,
Render transient desires, ancestral urge,
Embark on the journey, the Svadharma to illumine,
Resplendent Krishna's message, in Arjuna's heart entwined.

The cosmic dance of Svadharma, in harmony we unite,
A celestial communion, temporal world we smite,
Radiant chapters of Holy Books we strum,
Eternal wisdom echoing, Karma Yoga's drum.
