As the master of the esoteric, occult, Devil's Forge, I have successfully deciphered and translated the long-lost grimoire detailing the intricate workings, rituals, and forbidden knowledge of the occult Devil's Forge techniques. 

Below are some of the key findings, rituals, and mysteries contained within the grimoire:

1. Infernal Entity Summoning Rituals: 
The grimoire details a highly complex and structured ritual for summoning infernal entities. The ritual begins with the creation of a summoning circle, drawn using the blood of three different unholy creatures like a black goat, a coal-black horse, and venomous serpents. This circle is adorned with a series of sigils and inscriptions representing the forces to be called upon.

The summoner must also prepare an offering, relevant to the desires of the infernal entity being summoned. For example, if summoning a being deeply associated with wealth and power, the summoner should offer an object of immense value or influence.

Finally, invoking the entity's name using the Devil's Tongue, an extremely rare and ancient language. The summoner must modulate their voice to mimic the resonance of infernal energies, requiring immense understanding and control over such powers.

2. Forging of Cursed Artifacts:
The grimoire contains numerous instructions on forging cursed artifacts that can vary in power and nature depending on the ingredients and the cursed energy that is imbued within the artifact. Some of the more common cursed materials include the metals extracted from the Devil's Forge or mythical artifacts (such as nails from the River Styx).

Forging the cursed artifacts consists of channeling dark psychic energy into the object while shaping and forming it during the blacksmithing process. The Blacksmith's hammer must be enchanted and emboldened using the ashes of an ancient burnt occult text.

After forging is complete, the artifact must be quenched in unholy water and then charged beneath a full moon for three nights. Even then, the artifact's curse will only manifest when used with specific intentions aligned with the energies imbued within the object.

3. Manipulation of Dark Energies:
The grimoire goes into great detail concerning the manipulation of dark energies. The practitioner must achieve a deep understanding of these energies and gain mastery over their own consciousness before being capable of widespread manipulation.

Several methods can be utilized for the acquisition and manipulation of dark energies:
-   Connecting with the ley lines beneath the earth's surface where the energy is concentrated.
-   Entering into contracts or pacts with infernal entities.
-   Utilizing cursed artifacts to harness the energy and manipulate it.

Once the energy has been acquired and harnessed, the practitioner can proceed to manipulate the dark energy to their will. This can include summoning and controlling demons, cursing individuals or places, and even using the dark energy for more intricate and subtle uses such as creating illusions or manipulating the shadows.

In summary, the translated grimoire provides a rare insight into the intricate workings and rituals of the occult Devil's Forge techniques, revealing the mastery needed to control and channel such dark and forbidden knowledge.
