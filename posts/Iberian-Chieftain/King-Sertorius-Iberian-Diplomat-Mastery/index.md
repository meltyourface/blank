To fully respond to the knowledge challenge presented, we must first establish an understanding of King Sertorius, his relationship with the Iberian tribes, and the complexities within the Iberian Chieftain culture. By examining the interplay of occult symbolism, political maneuvering, and internal tribal struggles, we can better understand the intricacies of the situation described.

King Sertorius was a Roman statesman and military leader who gained prominence in Spain during the late 2nd century BC. With a keen intellect and mastery of psychological warfare, King Sertorius effectively asserted his influence over the Iberian tribes to consolidate allies and resources for his struggle against Rome. This was achieved through a combination of unconventional means, such as manipulating occult symbols and leveraging internal tribal dynamics to his advantage. 

One key aspect of Iberian Chieftain culture was the prevalent use of occult symbolism, which played a significant role in their religious practices, political power dynamics, and storytelling. King Sertorius cleverly exploited this facet by using esoteric symbols to create an aura of mystique around himself. For example, he claimed to be in possession of a sacred white deer that served as an oracle through which he could communicate with the gods. By making such assertions, King Sertorius elicited awe and reverence from the Iberian tribes, allowing him to project a sense of divine backing for his actions, which augmented his influence over their leaders.

Political maneuvering is an indispensable part of any society, and Iberian Chieftain culture was no exception. King Sertorius utilized his understanding of the disparate and often fractious Iberian tribes to realize alliances that would secure his power base. He achieved this by exploiting their rivalries and offering support to those who would be most receptive and beneficial to his interests. In doing so, King Sertorius mastered the delicate art of diplomacy, building a coalition of friendly tribes that would later provide crucial support against his Roman antagonists.

Finally, the internal tribal struggles that were prevalent in the Iberian Chieftain culture further complicated the situation. Each tribe had its own priorities, internal politics, and sources of power. These differences constituted a chaotic environment where diplomacy and power projection were critical. King Sertorius, with his deep understanding of their internal dynamics, recognized the importance of navigating these tumultuous waters by identifying and exploiting weaknesses and points of leverage within the tribes. His ability to manage such relationships often meant the difference between victory and defeat.

In summary, King Sertorius was a master of his craft, adept at wielding the tools of occult symbolism, political maneuvering, and internal tribal struggles to his advantage. His deep understanding of Iberian Chieftain culture allowed him to consolidate power and wield influence over the tribes in a manner that was both unconventional and highly effective. Through his manipulation of these intricate facets, King Sertorius demonstrates the rich tapestry of Iberian Chieftain culture and its myriad complexities. As a result, the story of King Sertorius and the Iberian tribes offers a fascinating case study in how a skilled statesman, well verse in the occult and diplomacy, can triumph in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.
