  In order to fully understand and respond to this knowledge challenge, I believe it's essential to first unveil the interconnectedness of various esoteric concepts. This will encompass elemental and celestial Arcane magics, the importance of self-mastery and invoking divine entities, as well as the historical connections between these forces. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of how these concepts can lead to enlightenment and transcendent knowledge through practical application and maintaining harmony within the cosmic order will be conducted.
  
  To start with, let us explore the elemental Arcane magics. **This sub-domain involves the manipulation and control of the four classical elements**: fire, water, air, and earth. Ancient magical practitioners believed that these elements embodied the essential building blocks of all realities. Therefore, the mastery of these powers enables a sorcerer to command and harmonize their subjective world and environment. This is widely recognized as the first step towards spiritual self-mastery.
  
  In tandem with their elemental counterparts, celestial Arcane magics emphasize the potentials of universal forces, such as astral bodies and planets, which govern various aspects of life. This school of magic teaches that these celestial influences imbue the fabric of reality, impacting everything from disposition and talents to spiritual potential and general well-being. Gaining proficiency in celestial magic entails learning how to align oneself with these energy patterns to manifest desired outcomes.
  
  Self-mastery and the invocation of divine entities are pivotal components of the transcendent power mix. True self-mastery signifies the achievement of self-knowledge, discipline, and intentionality. It is about harmonizing the personal microcosm with the universal macrocosm. By attaining this harmony, an initiate is better equipped to evoke divine beings and collaborate with these entities to augment their magical capabilities.
  
  The historical convergence of elemental and celestial Arcane magics has been a significant catalyst for spiritual growth. Dating back to the Hellenistic period and the Hermetic schools, elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Kabbalah all contribute to the complex tapestry of humanity's quest for transcendent wisdom. By synthesizing these rich cultural and esoteric histories, the path to enlightenment comes closer to fruition.
  
  Practical application of esoteric rituals and symbols is essential to achieving spiritual balance, cosmic harmony, and personal growth. The initiate's journey to enlightenment involves utilizing elemental and celestial Arcane magics in various ways, which may include meditation, visualization, sigil creation, invocation, evocation, and invocation of divine entities. Moreover, adhering to traditional esoteric practices, tools, and languages influences the potency of these applications.
  
  While striving for transcendence, maintaining harmony in the cosmic order is of utmost importance. This may entail preserving a constant balance of positive and negative energies, recognizing the interconnectedness of all entities, and adhering to the Principle of Correspondence, which asserts "as above, so below." Additionally, ethical considerations may necessitate working towards the greater good of all creation, rather than solely focused on personal gain.
  
  To summarize, the path to enlightenment and transcendent knowledge as related to the interconnection of elemental and celestial Arcane magics is a journey of self-mastery, invocation of divine entities, and understanding of historical connections. Practical application of rituals and symbols, while staying true to ethical principles and the preservation of cosmic harmony, enables the initiate to gradually ascend the spiritual ladder and reach higher levels of magical prowess and divine wisdom.
