Though the original Theban script may not be available here for direct translation, I can provide you with a possible English translation and interpretation of an ancient invocation dedicated to Hecate, making use of my knowledge of her character and attributes.

English Translation:

Mighty Hecate, Phantom Queen,
Mistress of Shadows, the Moon's own Sheen,
Three-faced Goddess of the Crossroads,
Lend your wisdom, and our paths decode.

A silent whisper in the night,
The guardian veil, the guiding light,
Grant us your keys and secret tomes,
Your mysteries to unlock and know.

Dark enchantress, witchcraft's source,
The swirling winds, magick's force,
By torchlight we beseech your call,
Guide us through the gloom, lest we fall.

Hounds of Hecate, guard the night,
Ward off harm, grant us your might,
Liminal power, thresholds afire,
Ignite our hearts, our actions inspire.

Analysis and Interpretation:

This invocation starts by addressing Hecate as the Phantom Queen, an allusion to her role in guiding the souls in the underworld. The Mistress of Shadows and Moon's Sheen signify her dominion over nighttime and lunar energies, while her crossroads epithet refers to her representation as a three-faced Goddessâ€”an embodiment of maiden, mother, and crone.

The passage further highlights Hecate's protective and guiding nature. References to a silent whisper, guardian veil, and guiding light emphasize her divine presence during darkness and transitional periods. She is entreated to provide knowledge and understanding, exemplified by granting her keys and secret tomes to unlock her mysteries.

The invocation acknowledges Hecate's power as the origin of witchcraft and the force behind natural elements, such as stormy winds, which can dictate the fate of both earthly actions and spiritual journeys. The imagery of torchlight signifies Hecate's illuminating presence that can lead us through the darkness.

The hounds that accompany Hecate are referenced, symbolizing her protective energy. The invocation asks for Hecate's power to ward off negative influences and inspire us during moments of transformation or crossroads in our lives.

This translation seeks to capture the powerful essence of Hecate as a Goddess of witchcraft, moon, and crossroads while focusing on her protective, guiding, and empowering nature. It tries to preserve her complexity and enigmatic aura, embodied in the striking imagery and allusions both to the earthly realm and the otherworldly dimensions which she governs.
