To craft the scrying mirror of Radical alterity.Dragon's Column, we shall follow a meticulously detailed process to ensure its magical abilities:
**Step 1**: Gathering Materials
Carefully acquire the following components:
1. A sizable obsidian disk, polished until a reflective surface is achieved
2. Dragon's blood resin
3. Silver dust
4. A wooden frame made from ancient oak
5. Essential oils of frankincense, myrrh, and sandalwood
6. Crystal dust from amethyst, blue kyanite, and moldavite
7. Sigils known to enhance clairvoyance and astral projection crafted onto parchment
**Step 2**: Frame Preparation
Anoint the wooden frame with the mixture of essential oils. Then, grind dragon's blood resin and silver dust together, transforming them into a dark pigment. Carefully paint the sigils onto the frame with this powerful mixture. Ensure each sigil is placed precisely, activating their magical potential.
**Step 3**: Assembly
Once the sigils have dried, gently place the obsidian disk within the wooden frame. Then, sprinkle the combined crystal dust along the edges of the mirror, infusing the stones' energies into the frame and obsidian.
**Step 4**: Ritual Empowerment 
Await the next full moon to perform the empowering ritual. As the moon reaches its zenith, arrange the scrying mirror at the center of a circle, with candles and offerings such as aromatic incense and precious stones to attract the dragons' attention. 
**Step 5**: Invocation
Under the moonlit sky, recite the following invocation:

Spirits of the Radical alterity.Dragon's Column,
Ancient and wise, your magic I now summon,
Within this mirror, let your realms be shown,
Guide my sight through your vast cosmic throne.

Guardians, lend me your transcendent breath,
Through astral planes, let us forge a path,
With your wisdom, lend me astral sight,
Illuminate my journey through the night.

By dragon's blood and sacred sigil's grace,
Inscribed within this mirror's sacred space,
I call upon the gifts you've sown,
Reveal the mysteries now unknown.

Azgûrzràm, the sacred word I speak,
Unleash the mirror's power, true and unique,
The bridge is formed, the connection's clear,
Astral beings, I stand before you, without fear.

Emerge from shadows, mighty forces obey,
Illumine the vision, through this scrying display,
Radical alterity.Dragon's Column, to you, I bow,
Accept this offering, our alliance forged now.
**Step 6**: Celestial Alignment
As you speak the last verse of the invocation, the full moon's light will bathe the scrying mirror with ethereal luminescence. The dragon's blood resin, obsidian, essential oils, and cosmic components will meld into a singularly enchanted artifact, capable of accessing astral planes and guiding visions beyond imagination.

By completing these carefully constructed steps, a transcendent scrying mirror is born. The Radical alterity.Dragon's Column mirror unlocks unrivaled opportunities to uncover hidden knowledge, explore celestial realms, and commune with ancient beings residing in astral dimensions.
