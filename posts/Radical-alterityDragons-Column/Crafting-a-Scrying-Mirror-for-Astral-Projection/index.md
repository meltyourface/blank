To craft an intricate scrying mirror imbued with the potent energies of Radical alterity.Dragon's Column, follow these detailed steps, each contributing to the mirror's ability to connect to astral planes:

1. ****Acquire a polished sheet of obsidian****: This volcanic glass is a rare material revered for its mystical properties. Its dark, reflective surface is ideal for scrying, and obsidian enhances the mirror's connection to astral energies.

2. ****Commission a frame of dragon's blood resin****: Seek out a skilled artisan to fashion a frame for your mirror. This resin, derived from the Dracaena tree, carries powerful protective and transformative energies. Binding the mirror in this material will both enhance its efficacy and solidify its ties to the transcendent wisdom of dragons.

3. ****Engrave ancient sigils onto the frame****: The mirror's frame must be inscribed with ancient symbols to improve clairvoyance and enhance astral projection. Symbols such as the Eye of Horus, the Pentacle of Solomon, and the Sri Yantra should be delicately incorporated into the frame's design.

4. ****Craft a stand of lemniscate****: Design a stand upon which the mirror will rest, taking the shape of the lemniscate (âˆž), which represents infinity and the eternal. The lemniscate will serve as a reminder that the mirror's power transcends the boundaries of time and space.

5. ****Perform an empowering ritual under a full moon****: Wait until the moon is at its fullest before executing the empowering ritual. Cleanse the mirror and its components with sage, salt, and a mixture of wormwood and mugwort. Arrange the items in a circle, surrounded by four candles representing the four cardinal directions.

6. ****Offerings and invocations****: Prepare an offering to the dragons, including items such as dragon's blood incense and gemstones like garnet, onyx, or jet. Recite an invocation to the dragons, inviting them to bless your scrying mirror with the wisdom of their kind. Appeal to specific dragons that symbolize your intentions, such as Tiamat for spiritual growth or Fafnir for transformation.

7. ****Energize the scrying mirror with powerful chants and motions****: As the ritual reaches its peak, harness the energies of the full moon and the offerings before you. Chant the names of the dragons, moving in synchronized motions to strengthen the bonds with their transcendent wisdom. Gaze into the obsidian mirror, envisioning the astral planes and other realms that it will allow you to access, and let your intentions flow into the obsidian.

8. ****Complete the ritual and integrate the scrying mirror****: Once the ritual is complete, lift the scrying mirror in the air, allowing it to absorb the remaining energy of the ritual. Store the mirror in a dedicated space, allowing it to rest on the lemniscate-shaped stand.

Now, your scrying mirror is imbued with the potent energies of Radical alterity.Dragon's Column, ready for you to successfully explore the unknown realms of the cosmos. Use it wisely, following the traditions of the esoteric order, and let the dragons guide your path in this divine journey.
