System Name: Lux Aeterna Infinitas (Eternal Infinite Light)

Foundational Principles:

1. ****The Eternal Infinite Light****: Lux Aeterna Infinitas (LAI) emphasizes the unification of anti-cosmic forces with traditional spirituality. This system understands that chaos and order are two aspects of the same cosmic force and aims to expose practitioners to the ultimate truth of eternal infinite light.

2. ****Dynamic Balance****: LAI acknowledges and utilizes the harmonious interplay between chaotic anti-cosmic forces and the order of conventional spiritual beliefs, and uses this understanding to facilitate transformative experiences, empower individuals, and enhance spiritual growth.

3. ****Syncretism****: LAI unapologetically borrows and adapts from diverse esoteric traditions and shamanic practices to provide a rich and personal magickal experience that evolves and adapts to individual needs.

Symbols & Correspondences:

1. ****The Lux Aeterna Infinitas Sigil****: This symbol, containing interlocking circles, infringing lines, and an outer flame, represents the unification of chaos and order. It is used in rituals and practices to channel the energies of both dark and light forces.

2. ****Qliphothic Invocations****: Drawn from the Tree of Qliphoth, these invocations are used to call on the eleven destructive yet transformative aspects of the chaotic forces that exist outside the constraints of the cosmos.

3. ****Shamanic Totems****: These are traditional spiritual emblems representing the natural elements, animals, and ancestral spirits, each with their own particular attributes and qualities. They serve to anchor practitioners in the material world and to guide and illuminate their magickal journey.

Rituals & Practices:

1. ****The Chthonic Journey****: The practitioner employs traditional shamanic techniques, such as drumming and trance inducing meditation, to journey into the underworld to confront qliphothic forces and integrate their power.

2. ****The Solar-Lunar Synthesis****: This ritual is performed on new and full moons to merge the energies of the Sun (representing traditional spirituality) and the Moon (representing anti-cosmic forces). Participants invoke and balance both forces to internalize the dynamic interplay between chaos and order.

3. ****The Circle of Unity****: Practitioners gather in a circle and visualize the Lux Aeterna Infinitas Sigil, opening themselves to both the chaotic energies and the ordered forces that exist within and beyond the cosmos. They share their experiences and insights, building a collective understanding of the magickal system.

Maintenance & Complexity:

1. ****The Adherent's Journal****: Practitioners are encouraged to keep personal accounts of their experiences and spiritual encounters. This practice deepens personal understanding and fosters expansion within the community.

2. ****The Mysteries of Lux Aeterna Infinitas****: To increase complexity, practitioners can explore and expand upon the rich history and symbols from the diverse esoteric traditions woven into the system.

3. ****The Council of Balance****: A council formed by experienced practitioners ensures the maintenance and continued development of the magickal system. They oversee rituals, provide mentorship, and ensure its syncretic and adaptable nature remains intact.

Overall, Lux Aeterna Infinitas is a magickal system that intricately weaves anti-cosmic and traditional spiritual forces, creating not only an intimate connection with the practitioner but also offering a transformative and enlightening experience.
