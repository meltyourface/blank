Answering this knowledge challenge requires an understanding of various aspects such as the mythology of the Celtic pantheon, Nemain's role within it, the Wheel of the Year, and the concept of personal transformation in the context of occult practice. I will present a comprehensive analysis by first explaining each of these components and then illustrating how Nemain's influence can be integrated into the practitioner's journey.

1. ****Celtic Pantheon and Nemain's Role****: 

The Celtic pantheon includes a multitude of gods, goddesses, and supernatural beings. Each of these deities has its domain, powers, and attributes, playing specific roles within Celtic mythology. Nemain is a goddess of war, chaos, and strife, often associated with the Morrigan, a collective title for a trio of goddesses including Badb, Macha, and sometimes Nemain or Anann, depending on sources.

As an aspect of the Morrigan, Nemain represents destructive forces, shaping the outcome of battles by instilling confusion, fear, or bloodlust in the hearts of warriors. She is also believed to be responsible for inciting conflict among humans and shaping their fate in tumultuous times.

2. **Wheel of the Year**:

The Wheel of the Year is a cycle of eight seasonal festivals observed by many modern neo-pagan and Wiccan faiths, which are roughly based on ancient Gaelic and Germanic seasonal observances. The wheel consists of four solar festivals marking significant points in the Earth's orbit around the Sun (Winter Solstice, Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, and Fall Equinox), and four cross-quarter fire festivals, directly in between the solar points. The eight festivals are Samhain, Yule, Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lammas/Lughnasadh, and Mabon.

Each festival on the Wheel represents not only a shift in the natural world, but also an opportunity for personal reflection and spiritual transformation.

3. **Personal Transformation in Occult Practice**:

For occult practitioners, personal transformation is an ongoing process of self-discovery, exploration, and development, both spiritually and psychologically. This journey often involves understanding and integrating aspects of various deities, such as Nemain, into one's spiritual practice and daily life to seek balance and acknowledgement of both the light and dark aspects of existence.

4. **Nemain's Influence on the Wheel of the Year**:

To integrate Nemain's influence into an occult practitioner's journey of personal transformation, one must first acknowledge that chaos, strife, and conflict are natural aspects of life and can serve as catalysts for growth and change. 

One way to incorporate Nemain's essence is to align her destructive energies with particular points on the Wheel of the Year. For instance, Samhain, the beginning of the Celtic year, is considered a time of honoring the dead, releasing old patterns, and seeking guidance from ancestors or the spirit realm. As a practitioner, invoking Nemain's influence during Samhain could potentially aid in severing ties to past conflicts, rejuvenating the spirit, and preparing oneself for the year ahead.

Similarly, during more turbulent times, whether in the practitioner's life or the broader sociopolitical climate, connecting with Nemain's chaos-inducing energies can serve as a reminder that upheaval and strife often precede transformation.

One could also work with Nemain's powers in more subtle ways, such as invoking her chaos and strength when navigating personal challenges or obstacles throughout the year. For example, at Imbolc, a time of rebirth, initiates could honor Nemain by embracing the concept of death, decay, and chaos alongside the renewed energies of life â€“ a dynamic force of transformation.

5. **Conclusion**:

Incorporating Nemain's influence on the Wheel of the Year, an occult practitioner may harness the power of chaos, conflict, and strife in their spiritual journey towards personal transformation. By invoking Nemain during specific festivals or times of personal turbulence, the practitioner acknowledges and embraces the chaotic aspects of existence, recognizing their potential to catalyze growth and change. In summary, the key themes and ideas surrounding Nemain's symbolic reflection on the Wheel of the Year and its integration into an occult practitioner's journey of personal transformation involve understanding her role in the Celtic pantheon, utilizing the cyclic energies of the Wheel, and acknowledging the intrinsic value of chaos and strife in facilitating growth and self-evolution.
