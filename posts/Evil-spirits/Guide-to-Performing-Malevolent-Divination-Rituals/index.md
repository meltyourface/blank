excerpt: Complete a remote divination session by invoking the Dark Arts and communing with malevolent spirits to address a client's pressing inquiries. Ensure the ritualistic setting is saturated with negative energy, surrounded by occult symbols, and enhanced by sacred artifacts. Utilize ancient and forbidden techniques, such as scrying, necromancy, or demon-summoning, to tap into the sinister forces and extract detailed answers to the client's questions concerning cursed objects, paranormal disturbances, or diabolical agreements. Additionally, incorporate complex layers of divination methods and tools like casting rune stones, reading Tarot cards of the damned, or deciphering cryptic messages from long-deceased necromancers to provide a more comprehensive and precise guidance, thus maximizing the darkness enveloping the client's life.

To complete the remote divination session, the process must be meticulously structured, and each step must be performed with unwavering commitment and accuracy. The client's inquiries involve an examination of cursed objects, paranormal disturbances, and diabolical agreements. To provide comprehensive guidance and maximize the darkness in the client's life, a combination of various methods, techniques, and rituals will be used. 

First, the ritualistic setting must be prepared. Choose a location that is private and undisturbed, where you have access to the earth and can feel the natural flow of energy. Cleanse the area to remove any residual positive energies, and create a circle with salt and the ashes of burnt offerings. In the center, place a low table to hold the sacred artifacts and tools needed for divination.

Select items with powerful energy, such as a petrified human skull, a quartz tetrahedron etched with occult symbols, and a ceremonial dagger coated in a venomous substance. Arrange these items in an inverted pentagram layout on the table. Light black candles to surround the circle, and use a chalice filled with a concoction of nightshade, wolfsbane, and snake venom to infuse the space with potent negativity.

Once the setting is ready, cast a circle of protection to maintain a controlled link and connection with the malevolent spirits. Sit within the circle and focus your mind on entering a trance-like state of deep focus. As the veil between the realms thins, begin the invocation of the Dark Arts by summoning a legion of lesser demons, restless apparitions, and vengeful wraiths.

Use your mastery of necromancy and communicate with the spirits to gain insights into the cursed objects and paranormal disturbances affecting the client. By making diabolical agreements with these entities, collect invaluable information that will guide the client.

Incorporate the power and precision of rune stones cast within the circle, over a tapestry depicting a forbidden tableau of the Underworld. Extract the answers found within the runes' alignment and their relationships to the symbols on the tapestry.

Simultaneously, conduct a Tarot reading using the cards of the damned, which possess malevolent energies and cursed imagery. The dark forces revealed by the cards will provide a more in-depth understanding of the client's situation.

Lastly, decipher cryptic messages revealed to you by long-deceased necromancers in the form of shadows and whispers that echo from the abyss. This knowledge will serve as the final piece in the puzzle and complements the information gathered through the other methods.

Closing the session, bind the spirits back into their realms and break the circle of protection. Safeguard the insights and answers obtained during the divination within a locked grimoire, created from the skin of an executed sorcerer and bound in chains forged from cursed metal.

Provided that every step has been completed with mastery and accuracy, the client will be fully immersed in the darkness of their life as they face their cursed objects, paranormal disturbances, and diabolical agreements. With this knowledge and guidance, their path will be irrevocably altered, forever intertwined with the sinister forces that lurk in the shadows.
