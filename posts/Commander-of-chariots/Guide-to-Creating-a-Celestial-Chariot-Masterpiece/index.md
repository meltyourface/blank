To create a comprehensive visual representation of the celestial Chariot as it leads an ethereal procession across the cosmos, begin by selecting a medium that allows for intricate detailing. For example, a large canvas with oil paints or a digital art program would be suitable. Then, follow these steps:

1. Background: Start by creating a vast cosmic space as your background, filled with stars and nebulae of various colors to mimic the beauty and depth of the universe. Add distant galaxies and supernovae to emphasize the grand scale of the cosmos.

2. The Chariot: In the center of the piece, depict the celestial Chariot itself, a resplendent chariot adorned with sacred geometry, ancient occult symbols, and elemental representations. Make sure to imbue the chariot with an aura or glow that signifies its power and presence in the celestial realm.

3. Astral influences: Illustrate the relationships between the celestial Chariot and the major astrological bodies in the form of zodiac constellations that surround the chariot. Show the effects of these influences on the chariot's movement and the procession itself by connecting each celestial body with a line or energy pattern to the chariot. Include the symbols of the planets and celestial bodies, emphasizing their interactions with the Chariot.

4. Celestial alignments and elemental symbols: Enhance the visual complexity of the artwork by incorporating the alignments between different celestial bodies that influence the path of the Chariot. Additionally, integrate the corresponding elemental symbols associated with each celestial aspect, such as fire, water, air, and earth, to emphasize the connection between the Chariot and the elemental forces that drive it.

5. Procession of ethereal beings: To showcase the celestial Chariot's commanding presence, include an ethereal procession of various spiritual and mythical beings, such as angels, ascended masters, or spirits of nature. Depict these beings in glorious attire that compliments the Chariot, interacting with each other and the celestial bodies in complex formations. This procession signifies the hierarchy and influence the celestial Chariot holds in the cosmos.

6. Sacred geometry: Enhance the visual impact of the artwork by incorporating sacred geometric patterns and symbols, such as the Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube, and the Platonic Solids. These patterns can be woven into the background, the Chariot itself, or the procession, adding depth and mystical significance to the piece.

7. Final touches: Complete your representation by blending the individual elements together, making sure that the intricate details remain clear and understandable. Add highlights, shading, and any other necessary visual effects to enhance the sense of awe and wonder the celestial Chariot should evoke.

This comprehensive visual representation of the celestial Chariot leading an ethereal procession across the cosmos will not only illustrate the Chariot's mastery over arcane chariot formations but also showcase the significance of celestial bodies, alignments, and elemental symbols in governing its path.
