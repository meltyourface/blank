To adequately compare and contrast the literary and metaphysical significance of Robert Fludd's "Utriusque Cosmi" and Sir Thomas Browne's "Religio Medici" in relation to 17th-century occultism, we will first delve into each work separately for context and general understanding. Following that, we will discuss their philosophical stances, the role of allegory, and the influence of Hermeticism on both works. Lastly, we will examine the key themes, ideas, and conclusions that can be drawn from both works and their importance in 17th-century occultism.

Firstly, let's discuss "Utriusque Cosmi" by Robert Fludd, a prominent English alchemist, occult philosopher, and physician. This work is an extensive two-volume treatise on the macrocosm and microcosm, focusing on the interconnectivity between the universe, man, and the divine. Its primary focus is the physical, metaphysical, and spiritual dimensions of the world and the individual's relationship to it. The central theme of Fludd's work is the divine harmony existing between the universe and the human spiritual nature, with Fludd expounding upon his belief in the sacred geometric principles and the vital correspondences between all things. Fludd's work is visually impressive, featuring intricate diagrams and illustrations to represent his ideas. 

On the other hand, "Religio Medici" by Sir Thomas Browne, an eminent English physician and author known for his interest in the esoteric, is a spiritual autobiography penned to detail his personal blend of religion and medicine. Browne sought to reconcile his scientific pursuits with his deep-seated faith and developed a unique form of Christian piety, influenced heavily by both the burgeoning scientific revolution and esoteric tradition. His work is a mix of personal anecdotes, religious reflections, and philosophical musings. 

With the foundational understanding of each work established, we can now analyze their philosophical stances. Fludd's work is deeply rooted in the Hermetic-Cabalist tradition, emphasizing the connection between the microcosm (individual) and the macrocosm (the universe). As a result, his philosophical stance is heavily influenced by Neoplatonism, asserting that the universe's structure is a divine, interconnected network. This paradigm offers a view of the world as an emanation of the divine, emanating from the godhead through a series of dimensions and descending into the material realm.

In contrast, Browne's philosophical stance in "Religio Medici" is primarily rooted in Christian belief. While he does engage with Hermetic and alchemical thought, these interests are blended with more orthodox perspectives, resulting in an eclectic theological outlook. His work is a testament to the conflict between faith and reason, focusing on personal experience and the quest for spiritual truth rather than a systemic framework of cosmic understanding.

Regarding the role of allegory, Fludd's work heavily utilizes symbolism and allegorical representation as a means to communicate complex ideas. A prime example of this is his iconic illustration of the "Divine Monochord," a single-stringed musical instrument that spans the entire cosmos and is played by the hand of God. This image conveys Fludd's belief in the interconnectedness of all creation, as each part of the cosmos vibrates in harmony with the divine will.

In contrast, Browne's work primarily explores allegory in the context of the human soul and personal experience. Allegorically portraying his own spiritual journey, Browne often references metaphorical contrasts between light and darkness, emblematic of reason and ignorance, or faith and doubt. Instead of cosmic illustrations like Fludd, Browne's allegory is more literary – providing introspective, metaphorical insights that stand on their own as well as underscore a more extensive religious and philosophical argument.

Regarding the influence of Hermeticism on these works, both Fludd and Browne's writings show clear evidence of its impact. Fludd's entire schema of cosmic interdependence is grounded in Hermetic principles of "As above, so below" and the belief in the subtle essences or spirit permeating all creation. The esoteric arts such as astrology and alchemy play a dominant role in Fludd's theoretical model.

Browne's work, though primarily focused on his personal faith, also reflects an interest in Hermetic ideas. His scientific investigations and inclusion of alchemical themes in his broader writings demonstrate his engagement with this esoteric tradition. However, the influence of Hermeticism on Browne's work is less overt and serves a more secondary role, acting as a means to enrich his understanding of Christian spirituality.

In summary, both Robert Fludd's "Utriusque Cosmi" and Sir Thomas Browne's "Religio Medici" hold literary and metaphysical significance within the realms of 17th-century occultism. Fludd's work, with its intricate diagrams and Hermetic worldview, presents a grand cosmic schema bridging the natural and divine realms. Browne's work, on the other hand, serves as a deeply personal exploration of the intersections between alchemical thought and Christian devotion. Despite the differences outlined – with Fludd's focus on cosmic interconnectedness and Browne's quest for spiritual harmony – both works contribute uniquely to our understanding of 17th-century esoteric ideas and embody the era's diverse forms of intellectual and spiritual pursuits.
