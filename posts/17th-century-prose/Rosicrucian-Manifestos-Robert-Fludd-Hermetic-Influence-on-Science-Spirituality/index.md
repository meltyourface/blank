Introduction:

In order to provide a comprehensive answer to this knowledge challenge, it is essential to first understand the context of the question, which involves three interconnected components: the 17th-century Rosicrucian manifestos, the esoteric and alchemical works of Robert Fludd, and the concept of hidden knowledge transmission. To perform a successful comparison and analysis of these three elements, we must delve into each component separately and subsequently bridge their intersections and the impact they had on the fields of science, spirituality, and hermetic philosophy.

The Rosicrucian manifestos:

The Rosicrucian manifestos refer to a series of anonymous publications released during the early part of the 17th century, specifically the 'Fama Fraternitatis', 'Confessio Fraternitatis', and 'Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz'. These works are generally attributed to the mystical and secretive Rosicrucian Brotherhood. They detail the society's mysterious origins, its beliefs, and its deeply held philosophies centered on Hermeticism and Christian mysticism, as well as the practice of alchemy, astrology, and Kabbalah. The impact of these manifestos was vast during their time of release, sparking immense curiosity, controversy, and even serving as the inspiration for other esoteric and secret societies. Their call for a general reformation, both religious and intellectual, contributed to the ongoing debates between religion and science.

Robert Fludd and his esoteric and alchemical works:

Robert Fludd (1574-1637) was a highly influential and prominent figure in various esoteric circles. He was an English physician, astrologer, mathematician, and Hermetic philosopher. While it is not entirely clear whether Fludd was an official member of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood, he was certainly among its early defenders. As a prolific author, Fludd produced several works exploring the interconnectedness of spiritual, occult, and intellectual concepts. Some of his most significant writings include 'Utriusque Cosmi' and 'Medicina Catholica'. His writings greatly contributed to the understanding of alchemy, Jewish Kabbalah, and the Hermetic traditions, while blending them with scientific concepts such as optics, harmonics, and geometry.

Transmission of hidden knowledge:

The concept of the transmission of hidden knowledge played a crucial role in the works of both the Rosicrucian manifestos and Robert Fludd's esoteric and alchemical writings. Hidden knowledge, often associated with ancient wisdom stemming from sources like the Hermetic Corpus and Neoplatonic philosophies, has long been an essential component of esoteric and occult circles. Its practitioners believe that this knowledge holds the key to transforming society and unlocking the potential for both material and spiritual progress.

Comparison and contrasts:

Now that we have gained sufficient knowledge about the key components of our challenge, let us compare and contrast the impact of the 17th-century Rosicrucian manifestos and the esoteric and alchemical works of Robert Fludd.

1. **Similarities**:
- Both the Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's works delve into the concepts of alchemy, astrology, and Kabbalah, thereby providing a foundation for their respective Hermetic beliefs and practices.
- Both emphasized the need for spiritual and intellectual transformation at a time when such ideas were revolutionary and disruptive.
- The Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's works both contributed to the larger discourse on hidden knowledge and its transmission and joined in promoting the synthesis of science, spirituality, and hermetic philosophy.

2. **Differences**:
- The Rosicrucian manifestos played a more subversive role due to their anonymous nature, hidden authorship, and targeted call for reformation. They triggered debates between the religious and intellectual communities and inspired the formation of other secret societies.
- Robert Fludd, while not an unquestioned member of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood, was a public figure, and his personal works provided an intellectual framework for esoteric thought. His contributions to various branches of natural philosophy, and the defense of the Rosicrucian ideals, made his works valued among occult circles.

**Conclusions**:

In summary, the 17th-century Rosicrucian manifestos and the esoteric and alchemical works of Robert Fludd both played significant roles in spreading the concepts of hidden knowledge transmission and promoted the intersection of science, spirituality, and hermetic philosophy. Despite their differences in origins and approach, their joint impact on the intellectual landscape of the 17th century allowed for the propagation of esoteric and hermetic ideas that facilitated a better understanding of the world and challenged existing norms.
