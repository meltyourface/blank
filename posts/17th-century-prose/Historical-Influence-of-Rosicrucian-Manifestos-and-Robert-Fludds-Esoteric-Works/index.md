To provide an in-depth understanding of the impact of 17th-century Rosicrucian manifestos as well as Robert Fludd's esoteric and alchemical works, we must first build a background on their respective origins, context, and the main components of both bodies of work. This discussion will span the historical foundations of each, their interrelation with hermetic tradition, the ethos of hidden knowledge, and the liminal space between religion, science, and esotericism.

Firstly, it is essential to grasp the historical context of Rosicrucian manifestos, which emerged in the early 17th century, with the publication of three primary texts: The Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis (1614), Confessio Fraternitatis (1615), and The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (1616). These foundational texts were steeped in the Western esoteric tradition, influenced by hermeticism, alchemy, and Christian mysticism. Their rhetoric centered on a universal reform of mankind through the attainment of hidden knowledge and wisdom, which would provoke renewed spiritual and intellectual vigor.

In contrast, Robert Fludd (1574-1637) was an English physician and alchemist of the same period, known for his magnum opus "Utriusque Cosmi...Historia" (1617-1621). Fludd’s work maintained a focus on theosophy—seeking to reconcile natural and spiritual philosophies—while also delving into alchemy and astrology. Thus, Fludd's oeuvre is characterized by an interest in the macrocosm-microcosm theory, exploring the correspondences between the human body and the universe, which were believed to conceal secret knowledge to reach divine wisdom.

Despite their distinct origins, both Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's writings share a common ground in the esoteric and occult fields, a reverence for hermetic philosophy, and, most importantly, their valorization of the hidden knowledge that connects the disparate forces of science, spirituality, and human nature. **We can compare and contrast these elements as follows**:

1. **Hermetic Philosophy**: Both the Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's works draw heavily from the hermetic tradition, which posits that the key to understanding the universe lies in deciphering the relationships between all its elements, terrestrial and celestial. The manifestos strived to establish a unity of knowledge, while Fludd's metaphysical structure emphasized the existence of divine archetypes as well as the correspondences between man, nature, and cosmos.

2. **Alchemy and Science**: The Rosicrucians placed a strong emphasis on the transformative science of alchemy, which encapsulated not only the transmutation of base metals into gold but also the human quest for spiritual ascension. Fludd, on the other hand, delved into fields like astrology and medicine, demonstrating a broader engagement with the scientific world while maintaining an interest in alchemical ideas.

3. **Hidden Knowledge Transmission**: Both Rosicrucians and Fludd propagated the belief that hidden or secret wisdom—encoded in their writings and philosophies—required diligent study and initiation to access. In their respective modes of securing higher knowledge, their emphasis lay on the process of spiritual transformation and achieving inner illumination.

4. Intersection of Science, Spirituality and Hermetic Philosophy: Rosicrucians and Fludd were notable for their efforts in synthesizing pre-existing ideas to develop original, comprehensive systems that transcended the binary divides separating religion, science, and the esoteric. Both pursued the reconciliation of these domains, striving to incorporate an all-encompassing wisdom within their frameworks.

To summarize, the 17th-century Rosicrucian manifestos and the esoteric works of Robert Fludd fundamentally impacted the transmission of hidden knowledge and the intersection of science, spirituality, and hermetic philosophy in the early modern Western world. While Rosicrucianism focused on transformative alchemy and the fraternity's pursuit for a universal reform, Fludd investigated astrology, theosophy, and the connections between humanity and cosmos. Both shared the ethos of striving for hidden knowledge and the valorization of hermetic wisdom, ultimately striving for a unity that transcended traditional intellectual boundaries.
