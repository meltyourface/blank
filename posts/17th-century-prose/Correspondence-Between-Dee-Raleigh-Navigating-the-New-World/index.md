description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, 17th-century prose, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.

Letter the First: from John Dee to Sir Walter Raleigh

To the Honour of my esteemed Friend, Sir Walter Raleigh,

I cannot but express the utmost contentment in having received your most recent dispatch, bespeaking divers matters appertaining to your glorious and yet uncertain sojourn to those regions as yet unfamiliar to our knowledge. Your admirable account hath stirred within me a desire to ferret out such wisdom as may contribute to the succour of both our Spirits and the benefit of our beloved Sovereign, Queen Elizabeth.

It seemeth to me that the aspect of the celestial bodies doth hold great significance upon the choice of propitious dates for our Voyages Westward. 'Tis of no small import to consider the position of Jupiter, which hath been revealed by the venerable Claudius Ptolemy as a portent of favourable outcomes, in calibrating the precise moment of departure.

Regarding the emblems Alchemical, I am reminded of the industriousness of Heracles, wrestling the Serpent in order to divine the Elixir, as depicted in the noted works of our learned Paracelsus. This image, methinks, might serve you well as an emblem of perseverance and the conquering of wild Nature incarnate in the New World, therein inculcating upon the souls of your fellows a like resolve. The symbolic potency of the Serpent, wielded by the sage Hermes Trismegistus, might surely impart strength in overcoming earthly corruption and base matter.

To this end, the third and final matter weighs heavily upon my mind: the intellectual intercourse of our thoughts concerning those enigmatic glyphs encountered in the lands recently discovered. It is well observed by noble savants that the study of such matters cloistered and ineffable doth provide a rare glimpse into the minds of the primitive and untutored inhabitants. **'Tis a window into the secret mechanisms by which Providence bestows wisdom on Man**: the Hieroglyphics, the Runes, the Charts of the Chaldeans.

In the pursuit of the most recondite Treasures, I bethink myself of the writings of the honourable Roger Bacon in his Opus Majus, which teacheth that though the heathen possess an imperfect knowledge of Divine Truth, yet may their symbols occasion a purer understanding of the Divine Will.

Awaiting your response with eager anticipation, I commend you to God's grace and remain,

Your devoted Friend and Servant,
John Dee

**Letter the Second**: from Sir Walter Raleigh to John Dee

My learned Friend, John Dee,

Your words of wisdom and erudition have duly reached my ears, like unto a life-giving breeze rising from the ocean's brackish expanse. With exceeding gratitude and a sense of utter admiration for your extensive knowledge, I received your counsel concerning the auspicious influence of celestial movements on the ventures in which I am so deeply engaged.

Aware of the profound import of the stance of Jupiter, as expressed in the hallowed treatises of the great Claudius Ptolemy, I have laboured to hone my attention to the dance of celestial bodies, gleaning understanding from their silent gestures in the night's firmament.

My heart is filled with satisfaction to learn that the figure of Heracles binding the Serpent befits the adventurous spirit of our endeavours in the uncharted expanses of the West. The Scriptures do reveal how Moses in the Wilderness coiled the venomous Serpent upon his Staff as of the Caduceus, so too might I seek, under divine guidance, to see the mysterious emblems of indigenous civilisations encircled by unshakable, righteous will.

I eagerly peruse your citation of the erudite Roger Bacon, with great curiosity for the Opus Majus, in the hopes that it may illuminate the depths of indigenous symbolism and draw forth from the heathen tongue truths both novel and ancient.

Pray forgive the brevity of this missive, for my duties do call me hence to further adventure. Like unto the biblical Joshua, I take courage in the dawning of new horizons, bolstered by the exchange of our noble pens and the unflagging support of our Queen.

Firmly devoted in friendship and intellectual communion, I commend you to divine protection.

Ever yours,
Sir Walter Raleigh
