Upon the First Study: An Introduction unto the Essentials of Occult Practice

Dearest reader, be forewarned that the arcane sciences presented here demand at once unwavering focus and steadfast diligence, lest their wisdom be obscured by the shadows of ignorance. It is for the fervent seeker alone that the gateways of understanding shall be laid bare. 

Let us sally forth and delve into the hidden recesses of Conjuration, Scrying, and Divination â€“ those preeminent trifold arts, like chiefest pillars, that uphold the obscured temple of the Occult.

**Unto the Summoning of Otherworldly Entities**: Conjuration

In the most eldritch annals of occult learning, one craft above all strikes awe into the stoutest of hearts, that of calling forth beings from nether realms. The process, known as Conjuration, requires scrupulous preparation and extraordinary discernment.

As our ancestors have documented, the very heavens comprise of a vast multitude of celestial spheres. Upon these spheres, are ethereal beings ranging in glory and virtue, from exalted Seraphim to dreadful Abyssal Fiends. 

To mount a bridge across this unseen world and the visible reality we inhabit, the aspiring conjurer must abide in a consecrated and hallowed space, adorned meticulously with symbols and sigils containing ancient power.

Utmost precision must be observed in the act of inscribing these symbols, for a hastily traced or botched circle may prove disastrous, unleashing forces beyond mortal rein. Let no one forget that secrecy too, is a coveted tool in the arsenal of conjurers, permitting only the worthy to engender communion with these unearthly forces.

**Upon the Power of the Piercing Gaze**: Scrying

As Conjuration illuminates the unseen inhabitants of celestial spheres, so does Scrying exalt the visionary capacity of the occultist. Scrying grants unto the beholder a glimpse beyond the veil of our terrestrial realm, allowing him to discern visions of import from across the vast expanse of time and space.

Mirrors of obsidian, pools of ink-black water, and spheres of polished crystal; these, kindred vessels do serve as unclouded gates into the unknown. With a steady gaze and a mind stilled by singular focus, the bearer may peer into them and see his desires made manifest in their reflecting depths.

A skilled scryer perceives within these vistas a concatenation of symbols and metaphors, presented metaphorically as shards of a shattered mosaic which must then be pieced together by adept reasoning. These fragments unveil the truths and prophecies eagerly sought, thus illuminating the paths of both the practitioner and those for whom he applies this enigmatic art.

Unto the Exalted Art of Divination

Divination, that final and lofty discipline, offers unto the seekers of wisdom a chance to lustrate their minds and delve into the hidden currents which permeate the very tapestry of life. These streams of oracular knowledge abide within the subtle bodies of all things, and they await the skilled diviner to unlock the whispers they yield.

Esteemed methods of Divination include the casting of sacred runes, the study of the Tarot's enigmatic cards, and the careful augury of swirling tea leaves. The tools themselves may alter, but the overarching principles remain true and constant.

As the diviner correctly interprets these profound symbols and portents, he shall come to know the inner workings of the world - both that which has been and that which has yet to transpire. Indeed, the art of Divination serves as a key, granting its master untrammelled access to the aetheric library of time and space.

And so it is, with the quintessential teachings of Conjuration, Scrying, and Divination unveiled, that the industrious student embarks upon their path into the vast, obscured landscape of the occult. Let these foundational elements be the pier to support the structure of their further wisdom, as they seek to traverse and become adepts in these arts which have persisted throughout the passage of time immemorial.
