To fully address this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the context behind the works of John Dee and Robert Fludd and the main themes of their publications: "Monas Hieroglyphica" and "Utriusque Cosmi." Both Dee and Fludd were prominent figures in the world of 17th-century esotericism and occultism.

John Dee, an English mathematician, astrologer, and occult philosopher, published "Monas Hieroglyphica" in 1564. The work primarily focuses on the concept of the "Monad," a mathematical symbol that Dee believed represented the key to unlocking the understanding of the cosmos and various aspects of creation. On the contrary, Robert Fludd, an English Perennial philosopher, physician, and writer, published his work "Utriusque Cosmi" in 1617. This publication includes a series of metaphysical images and illustrations meant to represent the order of the cosmos, as well as the microcosm and macrocosm, which are the interrelationships between humankind and the divine.

To begin, let us compare and contrast the representation of occult symbolism in both works. In Dee's "Monas Hieroglyphica," the monad symbol takes center stage as a representation of unity and harmony. Dee believed that the monad embodied mathematical and geometric perfection and was the basis for the creation of everything in the universe. The monad consists of the sun (circle), the moon (semicircle), the elements (cross), and fire (a line). Each of these individual symbols has its own occult symbolism and provides a powerful visual representation of Dee's philosophical ideas, emphasizing the influential role of divine geometry and mathematics in the cosmos.

In comparison, Fludd's "Utriusque Cosmi" utilizes a variety of intricate and detailed images to convey occult principles. Many of these images employ geometric shapes and symbolism to explore the relationships between metaphysical concepts and observable reality. For instance, Fludd's central image in "Utriusque Cosmi" depicts a circle divided into ten concentric sections, each of which represents a different aspect of creation or reality. The overall design represents the interplay between the microcosm and macrocosm and demonstrates the underlying connections between humanity, nature, and the divine.

Now, let us explore the authors' intents regarding the symbolism and their approaches to linking esoteric, occult knowledge with mainstream 17th-century literary culture. Both Dee and Fludd aimed to create a comprehensive system of understanding that bridged the gap between esotericism and mainstream thought. Dee's "Monas Hieroglyphica" attempted to illustrate the unity of creation through a singular glyph, which simultaneously depicted a complex and multidimensional understanding of the universe. Dee's ultimate goal was to provide a universal “key” to unlock the mysteries of the cosmos, which would unite the esoteric and mainstream perspectives.

Similarly, Fludd's intentions with "Utriusque Cosmi" were to provide a visual representation of the interrelationships between various aspects of creation, allowing readers to develop a deeper understanding of the connections amongst the natural world, human existence, and the divine. Fludd’s illustrations aimed to serve as a sort of "conversation starter" and to provoke intellectual discourse, helping to contextualize esoteric knowledge within mainstream literary culture.

In conclusion, both John Dee's "Monas Hieroglyphica" and Robert Fludd's "Utriusque Cosmi" serve as powerful examples of the use of occult symbolism in the 17th century, as well as the ways in which such symbolism was employed to bridge the gap between esoteric, occult knowledge and mainstream literary culture. Dee's focus on the monad as a representation of universal creation and harmony and Fludd's intricate illustrative approach to exploring the microcosm and macrocosm both sought to provide accessible and comprehensive systems of understanding for their audiences. Ultimately, these works demonstrate the persistent drive of these visionary thinkers to synthesize esoteric and mainstream perspectives in an effort to promote intellectual unity and more profound understanding of universal principles.
