In order to address the knowledge challenge at hand, we must first delve into the fundamental backgrounds and tenets of the Rosicrucian manifestos and the works of Robert Fludd. Let us start by elucidating these concepts, their historical context, and key contributions. Following that, we will examine the interrelations between the Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's writings in terms of their impact on the transmission of hidden knowledge, as well as on the development of the multifaceted connections between science, spirituality, and Hermetic philosophy in the 17th century. 

The Rosicrucian manifestos, consisting of three primary documents - Fama Fraternitatis, Confessio Fraternitatis, and The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreuz - emerged in the early 17th century, within the context of heightened societal upheaval and the struggle for intellectual freedom in Europe. They detailed the mythos of Christian Rosenkreuz and the secret fraternal order he founded, which combined elements of Christianity, Hermeticism, alchemy, and Kabbalah. The spiritual principles laid out in these documents advocated for a reformation of human understanding and the importance of moral and intellectual development. 

Robert Fludd (1574-1637) was a prominent physician, mystical philosopher, and writer in 17th-century England. A proponent of Paracelsianism and practical alchemy, Fludd strongly believed in the interrelatedness of the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of existence. He wrote voluminously on topics such as astrology, alchemy, and Kabbalah, integrating these into a unified philosophical system underpinned by Christian mysticism and Neoplatonism. His most significant work, the "Utriusque Cosmi", presents an all-encompassing view of the relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (humankind), demonstrating the interconnectedness of all creation. 

When considering the impact of the Rosicrucian manifestos and the esoteric works of Robert Fludd, it bears noting that Fludd's intellectual journey was deeply influenced by the Rosicrucian current of thought. This is evident in his defense and subsequent correspondence with the alleged originator of the Rosicrucian manifestos, Johann Valentin Andreae, as well as his adoption of the "magico-theurgical" approach of Paracelsus. Both the Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's works served as catalysts for the spread of esoteric knowledge and the revival of Hermetic philosophy in 17th-century Europe. 

On the transmission of hidden knowledge, both the Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's works offered unique perspectives by drawing upon mystic and alchemical traditions. The Rosicrucian manifestos portrayed the existence of a secret brotherhood and its hidden knowledge, piquing readers' curiosity and sparking intense interest in the study of alchemy, Kabbalah, and esotericism in general. Fludd's works, on the other hand, provided profound insights into the interconnected nature of creation and the microcosmic human experience, promoting the pursuit of divine wisdom and spiritual understanding.

Exploring the intersection of science, spirituality, and Hermetic philosophy, both the Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's works confronted the rigid scholasticism of their time. The Rosicrucian manifestos called for a reformation of knowledge and a synthesis of scientific and spiritual learning in alignment with Hermetic principles. Fludd, similarly, emphasized the unity of scientific inquiry and mysticism, proposing that acquiring a deeper understanding of the cosmos necessitated both rational investigation and divine revelation. 

In conclusion, the 17th-century Rosicrucian manifestos and the esoteric and alchemical works of Robert Fludd both significantly impacted the transmission of hidden knowledge and the interweaving of science, spirituality, and Hermetic philosophy. The Rosicrucian manifestos' portrayal of a secret fraternal order led to widespread fascination with esotericism and a revival of Hermetic learning, while Fludd's writings expounded a complex philosophical system that sought to harmonize scientific inquiry with mystical and alchemical knowledge. Ultimately, both the Rosicrucian manifestos and Fludd's oeuvre contributed to a transformative intellectual climate that spurred new explorations in the realms of science, religion, and the esoteric arts.
