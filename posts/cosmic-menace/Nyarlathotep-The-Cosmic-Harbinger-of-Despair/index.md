Answer:

**Introduction**:
Nyarlathotep, an enigmatic and malevolent cosmic deity in H.P. Lovecraft's literary oeuvre, is a prominent figure in the author's interconnected web of cosmic horror tales. Known for its multifaceted forms, the entity is notable for its overt interactions with both human and non-human characters in Lovecraft's works, engendering mind-shattering dread and reinforcing humankind's insignificance in the face of an indifferent and unfathomable cosmos.

### I. **Multifaceted Manifestations**:
To establish the interconnections between Nyarlathotep's many forms, it is essential to recognize that, unlike other cosmic entities in the Lovecraftian pantheon, this being actively engages with the world, displaying distinct avatars which highlight its pervasive nature.

A. **The Messenger and The Crawling Chaos**: Nyarlathotep is often known as the "Messenger" tasked with spreading madness and despair among humanity. This malignant deity is also referred to as "The Crawling Chaos," implying a chaotic and ever-changing quality, as well as its propensity for engendering psychological disarray.

B. **A Diverse Array of Forms**: Some of Nyarlathotep's most well-known guises include a tall, swarthy man (as depicted in the prose poem "Nyarlathotep"), a Pharaoh-like figure (in the guise of the Black Pharaoh), or in more monstrous forms such as the tentacled, bat-winged monstrosity (The Haunter of the Dark). The myriad forms serve to demonstrate its influence on diverse cultures and time periods, showcasing the entity's pervasiveness and omnipotence in every corner of human imagination.

### II. **Influence on Human and Non-Human Consciousness**:
Examining Nyarlathotep's engagement with both human and non-human characters reveals its capacity to exploit fear, inspire madness, and engender existential dread.

A. **Psychological Impact on Humans**: Characters who encounter Nyarlathotep often succumb to madness, despair, nightmares, or develop a morbid fascination with forbidden knowledge. For example, in Lovecraft's story "The Whisperer in Darkness," the narrator becomes intensely paranoid and fearful after learning of the entity's role in an alien conspiracy.

B. **Manipulation of Non-Human Entities**: Nyarlathotep is not only influential over human minds but also manipulates other horrific entities in Lovecraft's works, such as the dimension-hopping hounds in “The Hounds of Tindalos” by Frank Belknap Long, showcasing its unrestricted malevolence within the cosmos.

### III. **Implications on Existential Dread and Mankind's Insignificance**:
Finally, Nyarlathotep's various manifestations and influence on sentient beings serve as a reminder of humanity's futile struggle for meaning and understanding in an indifferent, uncaring cosmos.

A. **The Revelation of the Cosmos**: Nyarlathotep's interactions with humanity often result in the unveiling of vast and terrifying cosmic truths, reminding characters and readers of the insignificance of human endeavors and shaking the foundations of anthropocentrism.

B. **Incomprehensible Scale**: Nyarlathotep's presence emphasizes the overwhelming scope of the cosmos and its hidden horrors, overwhelming conventional notions of human agency and infusing a deep sense of existential dread in both characters and readers.

**Conclusion**:
Nyarlathotep, a cosmic menace of H.P. Lovecraft's fiction, serves as a nexus for understanding the dreadful interconnectedness of the cosmos, humankind's inconsequentiality, and the psychological devastation wrought by the revelation of these truths. Through various manifestations and the capacity to influence human and non-human consciousness, the entity leads humanity inexorably towards despair, madness, and abject fear, thus reinforcing the central themes of existential dread and cosmic insignificance prevalent in Lovecraft's works.
