You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Reconstruct an ancient and cryptic binding ritual to harness the essence of the malevolent cosmic entities that lurk within the extradimensional realms, utilizing archaic grimoires, relics, and deciphered manuscripts. Incorporate the invocation of primordial forces, forgotten sigils, and forbidden mantras to stabilize the multiplanar anchoring, while employing an intricate web of warding geometries to safely contain the bound cosmic menace. Guarantee the ritual's potency by performing it during a celestial alignment that amplifies the veil between dimensions, resulting in an enduring and potent confinement of the extraterrestrial menace and its devastating influence on our reality.

## The Rite of Malevolentinum

Ingredients and Materials:
1. Crystal shards from the fallen city of Xa'axaloth
2. Essential dust of Yllygaxian dreams
3. The Heart of the Unfathomable, an ancient grimoire written in the forgotten tongue of black stars
4. A parchment made from Mathyrus spider's web
5. Athabaskan obsidian knife for bloodletting
6. Chalice made of celestial aurorite
7. Sigil-stones of Azorkul embedded with forgotten sigils
8. Helmet of Elgazorr to safely channel and contain the cosmic essence
9. Candles made from the rendered fat of voidbeasts, infused with Yordavix weed
10. Circle of warding geometries, carved into the ground and/or floor, lined with powdered starstone

Configuration:
The Ritual of Malevolentinum must be conducted during the great celestial alignment, when the Moon eclipses the black hole residing at the center of our galaxy. This exceptionally rare event weakens the veil between dimensions, amplifying the effectiveness of the ritual.

Instructions:

1. Prepare the ritual area within the circle of warding geometries by placing the crystal shards from the fallen city of Xa'axaloth at the cardinal directions, equidistant from the circle.

2. Light the voidbeast-fat candles and place them around the perimeter of the circle. Burn the Yordavix weed to fill the air with its otherworldly fragrance.

3. Inscribe the forgotten sigils from the Sigil-Stones of Azorkul onto the Mathyrus spider web parchment using the Heart of the Unfathomable grimoire as a reference.

4. Mix the essential dust of Yllygaxian dreams with the invoker's own blood, harvested with the Athabaskan obsidian knife, and pour it into the celestial aurorite chalice.

5. Don the Helmet of Elgazorr and carefully place the parchment with the sigils inside the circle.

6. Begin the ritual by reciting the forbidden mantras found within the Heart of the Unfathomable, focusing on creating a stable multiplanar anchor to establish contact with the malevolent cosmic entities.

7. Use the infused chalice to anoint the circle of warding geometries as you fervently continue chanting the mantras.

8. At the height of the celestial alignment, pour the remaining blood and Yllygaxian dream dust mixture onto the parchment sigils, sealing the deal and completing the binding ritual.

9. Extinguish the candles and immediately remove the helmet to properly close the ritual, ensuring the cosmic menace remains contained and confined within the etched warding geometries.

10. Obtain and store the infused parchment containing the bound cosmic essence securely inside a box made of Psytonium alloy, rendering it inert, inaccessible, and unable to wreak havoc on our reality.
