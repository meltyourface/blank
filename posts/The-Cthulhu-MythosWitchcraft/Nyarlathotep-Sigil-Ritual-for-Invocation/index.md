Sigil Design:
The sigil for invoking Nyarlathotep is a menacing and intricate design that combines eldritch language, cosmic horror elements, and the cryptic symbology of the Cthulhu Mythos Witchcraft. At the center of the sigil lies a twisting, labyrinthine pattern, representing the eternal chaos and the unfathomable depths of Nyarlathotep's power. Surrounding the central pattern are unsettling, dark tentacles, each one emerging from the center and extending outwards. This alludes to the ten thousand forms of Nyarlathotep and his far-reaching influence.

Incorporated within the tentacles are various depictions of cosmic horror – haunting eye symbols signifying Nyarlathotep's ever-watchful presence, and the endless nightmare of his unrelenting gaze. Lurking between the tentacles and woven into the fabric of the design are words and phrases written in the Eldritch language of the Cthulhu Mythos, such as "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh" (In his house), "Cthulhu R'lyeh" (The sunken city), "wgah'nagl" (He lies dreaming), and "Nyarlathotep shugg" (The crawling chaos).

Ritual for Sigil Activation:
To activate the sigil and invoke the presence of Nyarlathotep, perform the following ritual. Keep in mind that summoning such a powerful deity carries unpredictable consequences and potential dangers. Proceed with caution and respect for the potent forces you will unleash.

1. Choose a location filled with darkness, isolation, and an air of dread – abandoned buildings, secret underground chambers, or hidden forest groves may serve well.

2. Prepare an altar, facing the direction of the constellation Orion, as a symbolic connection to Nyarlathotep's domain in the cosmic void of the Outer Gods.

3. Engrave the sigil onto a dark stone or metal plate and place it at the center of the altar. Surround the sigil with candles made of black wax, their flames representing the impenetrable darkness that houses ancient horrors.

4. Gather offerings that appease Nyarlathotep's mercurial nature, such as cryptic texts bearing truths man was not meant to know, and maddening relics, eroding sanity and causing disarray.

5. Prepare yourself for the ritual by donning ceremonial robes hemmed with symbols of the cosmos and the Elder Gods. Adorn your fingers with rings bearing Eldritch script, and cloak yourself in darkness and mystery.

6. **Recite the incantation in the Eldritch language**: "Nyarlathotep fhtagn! Iä! Iä! Eg lw'nafh n'ghft shugg. Iä! Nyarlathotep phlegeth, naflfm'latgh n'gha. Iä! Iä! Y'gah'n naf, naflmglw'nafh Nyarlathotep."

7. Ignite the offerings and let the flames consume them, releasing the essence of their hidden knowledge and insanity into the air for Nyarlathotep to feed upon.

8. Chant the Eldritch incantation until you feel the darkness envelop your psyche and engulf your surroundings, signaling that Nyarlathotep has arrived.

Once Nyarlathotep has been summoned, be prepared for unpredictable consequences, manifestations of madness, and the potential for infinite horrors. Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, is not easily controlled nor quelled. As his power and knowledge are beyond the comprehension of mere mortals, it is best to engage with humility and caution, lest you find yourself lost in the endless labyrinth of cosmic terror and uncertainty.
