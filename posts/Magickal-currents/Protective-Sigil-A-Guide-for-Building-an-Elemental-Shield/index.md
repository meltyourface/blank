To create a powerful and protective sigil utilizing Hermetic and Thelemic Magickal currents, we will begin with a simple, central design and build outward, adding layers of symbolism from various esoteric traditions and elemental associations. This sigil will be focused on shielding the individual or sacred space from negative energies and malevolent entities, drawing on the power of the elements and the Archangels.

Central Design:

Begin with a circle to represent the individual or sacred space being protected, which will also symbolize the infinite, unifying force of divinity. Inside the circle, draw a pentagram to symbolize the five elements (earth, fire, water, air, and spirit) and their harmonious balance in the universe.

Elemental Symbolism:

Around the circle, add symbols to represent the elements:

1. Earth: Draw a square to represent the solidity and stability of the Earth, being the foundation of physical existence.
2. Fire: Draw a triangle pointing upward, which represents the transformative and purifying power of fire.
3. Water: Draw a triangle pointing downward to signify the fluidity and receptive nature of water.
4. Air: Draw an upward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line, which indicates the expansive and communicative powers of air.

Archangelic Representations:

Incorporate the sigils of the four Archangels around the circle:

1. Michael: Placed near the Fire symbol, draw the sigil of Archangel Michael from the Lesser Key of Solomon (a figure resembling the letters "M" and "Y" connected) to represent protection, courage, and strength.
2. Raphael: Placed near the Air symbol, draw the sigil of Archangel Raphael from the Lesser Key of Solomon (a figure resembling the letter "R" connected with a diagonal line) to invoke guidance, healing, and travel.
3. Gabriel: Placed near the Water symbol, draw the sigil of Archangel Gabriel from the Lesser Key of Solomon (a figure resembling the letter "G") to inspire dreaming, creativity, and emotional awareness.
4. Uriel: Placed near the Earth symbol, draw the sigil of Archangel Uriel from the Lesser Key of Solomon (a figure resembling the letters "U" and "I" connected) to signify understanding, wisdom, and change.

Esoteric Traditions:

Integrate runes and sigils from various traditions:

1. Add the Algiz Nordic Rune for protection and shielding.
2. Incorporate the Enochian "MALEFICARUM" (Enochian for protection) around the outer edge of the circle.

Color Associations:

Use color correspondences to infuse the sigil with additional vibrational qualities:

1. Red: The flames of transformation and fire, resonating with Michael.
2. Yellow: The intellect and wisdom of air, resonating with Raphael.
3. Blue: The intuition and emotional clarity of water, resonating with Gabriel.
4. Green: The abundance and growth of earth, resonating with Uriel.
5. White or Silver: The unifying force of spirit and divine protection.

Intention-Setting Meditation:

The power of this sigil will amplify with focused meditation and intention. Spend time meditating on the sigil, envisioning it radiating with protective energy, and asking the Archangels and elemental forces for assistance in shielding the individual or space from negative energies and malevolent entities.

In conclusion, by combining symbols from Hermetic and Thelemic magickal currents with esoteric tradition, elemental associations, and focused intention, this sigil serves as an effective and comprehensive shield against negative energies and malevolent entities. Infuse your intention into the sigil through meditation and practice, and the sigil will grow stronger and more radiant with your efforts.
