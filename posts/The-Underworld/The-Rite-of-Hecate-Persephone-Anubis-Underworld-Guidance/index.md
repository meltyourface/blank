## Title: The Rite of Shadows

Purpose: To beseech the aid of Hecate, Persephone, and Anubis in acquiring guidance, wisdom, and strength from The Underworld. 

Preparation:

1. Choose a location that resonates with the energies of The Underworld. Ideal locations include crossroads, cemeteries, or secluded woodlands.

2. **Gather the necessary items**:
   - A black robe or dark clothing
   - Salt or powdered chalk for casting the sacred circle
   - A silver chalice filled with pomegranate juice or red wine
   - Three candles: one black (Hecate), one green (Persephone), and one gold (Anubis)
   - A key, a pomegranate, and a set of small scales or an ankh
   - Pen and paper
   - A drum, rattle, or other items for creating rhythmic sounds
   - Incense of myrrh, frankincense, and cinnamon

3. **Obtain the following incantations**: the Hymn of Hecate, the Paean of Persephone, and the Invocation of Anubis. These can be found in reputable grimoires or created by the practitioner.

Phase 1: Cleansing and Aligning with the Lunar Cycle
The ceremony should be performed during the waning moon or, ideally, the dark moon. This period symbolizes the descent into The Underworld and the forces of transformation at work.

1. Purify the ritual space by sprinkling salt or chalk in a clockwise direction while chanting a simple, powerful incantation to banish unwanted energy and establish a protected space.

2. Don the dark clothing or black robe and stand in the center of the purified space.

3. Light the incense, allowing the scents to harmonize with the energies of The Underworld.

Phase 2: Casting the Sacred Circle
1. Hold the chalice in both hands and focus on connecting with the spiritual energies of The Underworld.

2. **Begin the chant**: "By the power of Hecate, Persephone, and Anubis, I cast this sacred circle. May it be a conduit between the realms above and below, forging a bridge to The Underworld, from whence our guides emerge."

3. Cast the circle by walking clockwise around the circumference, while pouring the pomegranate juice or red wine in a continuous line.

4. Place each of the three candles at the edge of the circle, corresponding to the respective deities: black in the west (Hecate), green in the east (Persephone), and gold in the south (Anubis).

5. Light the candles while invoking each deity - first Hecate, then Persephone, and finally Anubis.

Phase 3: Recitation of Ancient Incantations and Offerings
1. Stand before the black candle and recite the Hymn of Hecate. Offer the key as a symbol of her role as the Keeper of the Crossroads.

2. Move to the green candle and recite the Paean of Persephone. Offer the pomegranate as a symbol of her connection to the land of the living and the dead.

3. Proceed to the gold candle and recite the Invocation of Anubis. Offer the set of scales or an ankh as a symbol of his role as the Guardian of the Dead and the Weigher of Souls.

Phase 4: The Depths of Communion
1. Return to the center of the circle and sit with the pen and paper in hand.

2. Begin drumming or rattling to induce a meditative state that connects you to the energies of The Underworld.

3. Concentrate on your request, be it wisdom, guidance, or protection, and visualize your intention being transmitted into The Underworld.

4. When a response or message is received, write it down.

5. Once the communication is complete, express gratitude to the chosen entities.

Phase 5: Closing the Sacred Circle
1. Extinguish the candles one by one while thanking each deity.

2. Walk counterclockwise around the circle, chanting: "By the grace of Hecate, Persephone, and Anubis, I now close this sacred circle and release their energy with gratitude and reverence."

3. Cleanse the ritual space by gathering the remains of the offerings and returning them to the earth.

4. Choose a location to keep the written message and reflect upon its significance for future guidance.
