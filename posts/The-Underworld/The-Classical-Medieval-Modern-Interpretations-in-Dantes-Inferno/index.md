To address this knowledge challenge, we first need to begin by understanding the key components: the tripartite concept of the Divine Comedy, the classical, medieval, and modern interpretations of the Underworld, and the initiatory myth of descent and transcendence. Throughout the response, we will analyze the moral, psychological, and spiritual dimensions as they relate to these components and how they are interconnected.

The Divine Comedy, written by Dante Alighieri in the early 14th century, is an epic poem consisting of three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. The narrative follows the poet's journey through the realms of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil and later Beatrice, Dante's idealized love. The Inferno, specifically, takes us through Dante's vision of Hell, a complex, multi-layered system where sinners are punished according to their sins. 

The classical interpretation of the Underworld comes from ancient Greek and Roman sources, primarily Hades, the realm of the dead that is named after its ruler. This realm was populated by shades (spirits of the deceased) and was characterized as a monotonous, gloomy place. The medieval interpretation was heavily influenced by Christian beliefs, in which Hell was a place of eternal torment, reserved for those who had sinned and did not repent for their transgressions before death. The modern interpretation is more varied and could range from scientific and rationalistic views of the Underworld as a metaphor for the human subconscious to more fantastical and imaginative literary depictions.

The initiatory myth of descent and transcendence is a recurring narrative found in several ancient cultures, where an individual undergoes a transformative journey into the depths of the underworld, often to obtain wisdom or save a loved one, and eventually transcends or returns enlightened or changed. This motif can be found in stories of heroes like Orpheus, Hercules, and the Mesopotamian myth of Inanna.

Now we move on to analyze how the Inferno embodies the classical, medieval, and modern interpretations, highlighting the moral, psychological, and spiritual dimensions, and its relation to the initiatory myth of descent and transcendence.

- The classical interpretation is evident in the way Dante's Hell has been orchestrated. It shows influences from Greek and Roman mythology, featuring figures like Charon, the boatman who ferries souls across the river Acheron, and mythological creatures like Cerberus. Dante also acknowledges the great poets and thinkers of antiquity by placing them in the first circle of Hell, Limbo, as an honorable mention. The circles of Hell themselves are reminiscent of Hades' multiple realms.

- The medieval interpretation is predominantly present through the incorporation of Christian theology. Dante's vision of Hell is essentially a moral hierarchy dictated by sin and divine justice. Every punishment is carefully tailored to fit the sin committed, following the principle of contrapasso. This reinforces the moral dimension by emphasizing the consequences of one's actions and embedding the idea that repentance and divine mercy are the keys to salvation.

- The modern interpretation comes through Dante's deeply psychological exploration of the human condition, which can be observed in his nuanced portrayal of human emotions, desires, and weaknesses. The psychological aspect is prevalent in the way Dante encounters several historical and contemporary figures and uses their stories to create complex moral dilemmas, inviting readers to question their own beliefs, behavior, and the true meaning of justice.

The initiatory myth of descent and transcendence is embodied in Dante's journey through Hell. As he descends deeper into the Inferno, he learns firsthand about the different sins and their consequences. Simultaneously, he undergoes an internal transformation, gaining self-awareness, releasing his moral naivety, and developing emotional resilience. This narrative structure holds a spiritual dimension for readers, encouraging them to embark on a similar journey of introspection and moral inventory.

In conclusion, the Inferno portion of the Divine Comedy embodies the classical, medieval, and modern interpretations of the Underworld through its rich interplay of mythological, theological, and humanistic elements. The moral dimension is projected through the structure of Hell and the principle of contrapasso, the psychological aspect through Dante's exploration of the human condition, and the spiritual significance is evidenced by his initiatory journey of descent and transcendence. Ultimately, the Inferno serves as a profound reflection on the consequences of human actions, the multifaceted nature of justice, and the transformative potential of self-awareness and moral reckoning.
