## The Anti-Cosmic Current: An Encyclopedic Entry

Introduction

The Anti-cosmic current represents a philosophical and esoteric tradition opposing the structure and order of the cosmos, seeing it as inherently flawed, and seeking to bring about its transformation or dissolution. At the core of this path lies the belief in the existence of a higher reality beyond the confines of the material world, reachable through various occult practices and rituals. The Anti-cosmic current encompasses a wide array of ideas and practices, with some resemblances between different traditions, such as Gnosticism, certain strands of Tantra, and various forms of Satanic and Left-hand path occultism.

Key Principles and Philosophical Underpinnings

1. **Dualism**: Anti-cosmic teachings often posit a dualistic framework, differentiating between the divine realm (the ultimate reality) and the material cosmos (a flawed and limited creation). This distinction is paramount for understanding the Anti-cosmic current's opposition to the cosmic order.

2. **Liberation from the material world**: The Anti-cosmic current seeks to attain liberation from the material cosmos and its limitations. By breaking free from the cosmos, practitioners aim to access the divine realm and unite with the Ultimate. To achieve this goal, practitioners of Anti-Cosmic traditions utilize various esoteric practices and rituals.

3. **Use of Acausal energies**: The Anti-cosmic current emphasizes working with acausal (beyond cause and effect) energies, which allows one to act beyond the limitations of material causality. These energies are usually associated with primordial, pre-cosmic, and chaotic forces.

4. **Antinomianism**: In an Anti-cosmic context, antinomianism represents the rejection and transgression of conventional moral and social norms as a means to break free from the confinements of the material world. By transcending these constraints, practitioners embrace a more authentic and unbounded existence in alignment with the divine realm.


The Main Goal/Purpose

The primary objective of the Anti-cosmic current is to pursue an awakened state or liberation from the material cosmos and its limitations. This process involves the deconstruction of the cosmic order and the reunion with the divine reality. The pursuit of this transcendent knowledge may lead to one becoming a potent force for change in the cosmos or a catalyst for cosmic dissolution.

Initiation, Rituals, and Esoteric Practices

1. **Initiation**: Entry into the Anti-cosmic current often involves a formal or informal initiation process, wherein the practitioner undergoes a transformative experience that aligns them with the principles of the tradition. Initiation serves to place the aspirant on the path towards achieving the main goal by conferring upon them the necessary insights and abilities.

2. **Rituals**: Rituals are an essential aspect of the Anti-cosmic current, serving as means to harness and direct acausal energies. Such rituals may involve the use of symbolism, invocations, and various offerings to evoke and appease the pre-cosmic forces identified with the Anti-cosmic tradition. By uniting with these forces, the practitioner further solidifies the connection with the divine realm.

3. **Meditation and Visualization**: Esoteric practices, such as meditation and visualization, help the practitioner focus their mind, explore inner realms, and develop a deeper connection with the acausal energies. These techniques often involve the use of specific breathing patterns, mantras, and mental imagery, guiding the practitioner towards the desired transcendent state.

4. **Alchemy**: Certain Anti-cosmic traditions employ alchemical practices as a means for inner transformation. This form of alchemy focuses on refining one's spiritual essence and transcending the boundaries of the material world. A practitioner may use various techniques, including sexual alchemy, to harness the power of their inner energies and reach a higher state of consciousness.

In conclusion, the Anti-cosmic current is a profound and diverse philosophical and esoteric tradition that seeks to dissolve the cosmic order and break the limitations of the material world. Its core principles, philosophical underpinnings, and practices provide adepts with a rich tapestry of insights and experiences to guide them towards self-liberation, spiritual growth, and profound understanding of the often neglected or obscure aspects of reality.
