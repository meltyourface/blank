1. **Tunnel Selection**: For this ritual, we will focus on Tunnel 19, Raflifu. This tunnel is associated with rot, decay, and the perpetual need for transformation.

2. **Key Sigils**: The primary sigil required for this ritual is the Sigil of Raflifu, which takes the form of a serpent-like entity devouring its own tail. To draw this sigil, begin with a circle and draw a serpentine figure within it, ensuring the serpent's tail is in its mouth. The opportune moment to reveal this sigil is during the invocation.

3. **Ritual Location**: The ritual should take place in a location that embodies decay and transformation, such as an abandoned building or a dark forest at night. The space should be adorned with symbols that represent the Anti-cosmic current, including the three-forked trident, the eye of Lucifer, and the eleven-pointed star. These elements are crucial as they connect the practitioner to the Anti-cosmic forces.

4. **Elaborate Attire**: The practitioner should wear black garments that symbolize the void and the anti-cosmic current. Adornments and talismans, such as snake-themed jewelry and an amulet bearing the Sigil of Raflifu, should be worn. These items help establish a connection with the energies and entities of the chosen Tunnel of Set.

5. **Astrological Alignments and Moon Phases**: The ritual should be performed during the waning crescent moon to harness its potent energies of decay and transformation. Additionally, the planets Saturn and Pluto should be aligned or in a significant aspect within the practitioner's birth chart to facilitate the required energies of destruction and rebirth.

6. **Chant and Invocation**: The following invocation can be used at specific moments throughout the ritual:

"By the powers of the Anti-cosmic current, I call upon thee, Raflifu,
Serpent of decay, guide my path through darkness and rebirth.
Through the chosen Tunnel of Set, entwined with the essence of change,
Grant me thy wisdom, as I embrace the void within and without."

7. **Meditation and Visualization**: The practitioner must become proficient in maintaining focus and intent through practiced meditation and visualization techniques. Visualize the Sigil of Raflifu as a gateway in your mind's eye, and envision yourself entering the Tunnel as your surroundings decay before your eyes. Stay focused on your intent, and let the transformative energies of Raflifu guide your journey.

8. **Closing the Ritual and Addressing Residual Energies**: To close the ritual, thank Raflifu and any other entities encountered for their guidance and wisdom. Visualize the Sigil of Raflifu disappearing into the void, signifying the end of your journey through the Tunnel. Re-center yourself in your physical space, grounding any residual energies or sensations by envisioning them dissolving into the earth below you. Finally, cleanse your ritual space using elements such as smoke or blessed water to ensure no lingering energies remain.
