To examine the connections between the Qliphothic forces within the Anti-cosmic current and their direct influence on the process of deconstructing the binding illusions of linear time in one's personal spiritual journey, we must first understand the foundational concepts and background information of these compelling mystical topics. 

The Anti-cosmic current is a subversive spiritual and philosophical system that stands opposed to the prevailing notions of order and harmony in the cosmos. It asserts that the universe, along with any perceived order and structure within it, is fundamentally flawed and restrictive. Adherents of the Anti-cosmic current often relate their views back to Chaos, which refers to the formless primordial void from which all things emerge.

Now, let's discuss the Qliphothic forces and how they relate to the Anti-cosmic current. The Qliphoth, in Jewish Kabbalah, represents the evil or impure spiritual forces that exist as counterbalances to the divine energies or Sefirot, emanations of divine energy within the cosmos. The Qliphoth operates in the shadows, the inverse of the holy Tree of Life, and its forces are associated with everything that lies outside the bounds of cosmic order and convention. These forces have transformative and liberating properties for those who dare to engage with them.

Understanding the nature of these forces, we can now examine how they influence the deconstruction of linear time in one's spiritual journey. Linear time, as generally understood, is the conventional perception of past, present, and future as a continuous and unidirectional flow. This perception creates limitations in our spiritual understanding, as it binds us to a narrow conception of existence and progress.

Within the Anti-cosmic current and Qliphothic explorations, adherents abandon their attachment to the temporal flow and actively engage with the chaotic essence of existence. By doing so, they can break the shackles of linear time and merge with the multidimensional realms beyond. This process of deconstruction allows individuals to perceive the myriad possibilities of existence and explore the boundless potential within themselves. It further enables the adherents to expand their consciousness, achieving profound insights and experiences that might otherwise remain hidden behind the veil of temporal limitations.

To summarize, the key themes, ideas, and conclusions are as follows:

1. The Anti-cosmic current is a subversive spiritual system that challenges the perceived order and harmony of the universe.
2. The Qliphothic forces, as counterparts to the divine emanations in Jewish Kabbalah, are closely associated with the Anti-cosmic current, and they have transformative and liberating properties.
3. Linear time, as conventionally understood, restricts our spiritual understanding and growth.
4. By engaging with Qliphothic forces and embracing the Anti-cosmic current, one can deconstruct the illusions of linear time and break free of its limitations.
5. The process of deconstruction ultimately enables one to explore the limitless possibilities within themselves and the universe, accessing profound spiritual growth and insights.
