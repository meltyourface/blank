## The Anti-cosmic Current: Origins, Beliefs, and Practices

Introduction

The Anti-cosmic current, also known as the Current 218 or the Sinister Path, represents a unique paradigm within the realm of the occult. Emerging from the teachings and insights of a constellation of traditions, the Anti-cosmic current is characterized by its opposition to the established cosmic order. For those seeking deeper understanding and engagement with the occult, this passage will provide a foundation for exploration into this mysterious and transformative current. We will delve into its origins, core beliefs, and practices pertinent to the Anti-cosmic current and its proponents.

Origins

The Anti-cosmic current has evolved over the centuries, with its roots found in various ancient traditions. Some of the key influences on this path include Gnosticism, with its emphasis on the flawed, prison-like nature of the material world; various Eastern philosophies, such as Tantra and its focus on transcending the limitations imposed by the cosmic order; and elements of Chaos Magick and Setianism, which emphasize individualism, antinomianism, and the importance of self-deification. Throughout history, these diverse influences have interwoven, culminating in a multifaceted current which challenges the traditional conceptions of reality, spirituality, and power.

Beliefs

Central to the Anti-cosmic current is the belief that the cosmos, or the manifested universe, is inherently flawed and constraining for spiritual progression. It posits that the world as we know it is a prison, designed to keep individuals locked within a deterministic cycle of causality and limitation. The entities responsible for this system are often referred to as cosmic tyrants, demiurges, or archons – beings who thrive on the control and subjugation of the individual spirit.

In contrast to the cosmic tyrants, Anti-cosmic practitioners venerate entities that represent opposition, rebellion, and liberation. These entities, often referred to as "Sitra Ahra" or "the Other Side," encourage practitioners to transcend the restrictions imposed by the cosmos and its architects. Some notable Anti-cosmic entities include Lilith, Samael, and the eleven Qliphothic forces presented in the Nightside of Eden.

One of the core tenets of the Anti-cosmic current is the deification of the self and the ultimate alignment with the forces of the Other Side. Practitioners view themselves as potential gods in the making, with the ability to harness unlimited power, shatter the bounds of the cosmos, and shape reality according to their individual will. It is also vital for practitioners to strive for genuine individuation and self-realization, as this empowers them to sidestep the illusory existential traps placed by the cosmic architects.

Practices

Anti-cosmic practices are eclectic in nature, yet they all share a common focus – the acquisition of gnosis (knowledge) and power through subversive and transformative means. Among these practices are various forms of individual and group rituals, meditations, invocations, and evocations. One of the aims of these practices is to forge alliances with the entities of the Other Side, harness their power, and gradually transmute the practitioner's very essence to resonate with their Anti-cosmic nature.

Anti-cosmic magicians also employ sigils, symbols, and tools associated with the Sinister Path, including those affiliated with the Qliphoth – the shadow side of the mystical Tree of Life. These practices are aimed at unlocking wisdom hidden in the dark aspects of existence, where the cosmic tyrants hold no sway.

Conclusion

The Anti-cosmic current, with its origins in various ancient traditions and emphasis on opposing the established cosmic order, provides a challenging and transformative path for individuals interested in the realm of the occult. By understanding its history, beliefs, and practices, one can embark on a journey of self-discovery, spiritual rebellion, and the ultimate fulfillment of one's divine potential.
