The answer is 3. Following the Left-Hand Path and seeking self-deification.

In the Anti-cosmic current of occultism, the main aim is to defy and rebel against the cosmic order, which is believed to be established and maintained by the Demiurge. The Demiurge is considered an oppressive force, seeking to subdue the potential of humans and keep them enslaved within the realms of the physical and spiritual cosmos. The Left-Hand Path (LHP) refers to a path that goes against conventional beliefs and morals, embracing nonconformity, individualism, and personal power.

Answer 1, aligning with the Demiurge's will to maintain an orderly universe, would not be considered an act of rebellion because it follows the established cosmic order and supports the Demiurge's intentions.

Answer 2, performing a Chaos Magick ritual to disrupt the established order and bring about change, may seem like a disruptive act on the surface, but it's not inherently an Anti-cosmic act. Chaos Magick is a system of magick that focuses on the flexibility of belief and the power of the practitioner, but it does not specifically encompass the abnegation of the cosmic order. Therefore, though it can be used in conjunction with Anti-cosmic goals, it's not exclusively an Anti-cosmic practice.

Answer 4, assisting human society in aligning with cosmic law and harmony, would not be considered an act of rebellion because it follows the cosmic order and aims to create harmony with the Demiurge's vision. This would be antithetical to Anti-cosmic thought.

Following the Left-Hand Path means accepting one's potential for divinity while rejecting the moral and ethical systems set forth by the cosmic order. It is a path of breaking free from the restrictions of the physical, mental, and spiritual worlds in order to ascend to a state of self-deification. This rebellion involves liberating oneself from the confines of the established order and transcending the boundaries created by the Demiurge.

In the history of occultism, several figures and traditions have been associated with the Left-Hand Path, such as the Gnostic tradition, which rejected the Demiurge in favor of seeking enlightenment through personal gnosis, or the Temple of Set which sought to connect with the ancient Egyptian god Set—often interpreted as an adversarial figure—as an embodiment of self-actualization and self-deification.

In conclusion, following the Left-Hand Path and seeking self-deification is the act of rebellion against the cosmic order within the Anti-cosmic current of occultism. This path is about defying the restrictive systems established by the Demiurge and embracing one's own power and potential for divinity beyond the realm of cosmic limitations.
