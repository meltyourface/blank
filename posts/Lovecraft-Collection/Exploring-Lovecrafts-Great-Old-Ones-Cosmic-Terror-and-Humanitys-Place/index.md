To analyze the intricate relationships between Lovecraft's Great Old Ones and their cosmic mythology, and to draw connections between the existential themes of these ancient entities, the inner symbolic nature of their rituals and affiliations with lesser beings, and how these elements ultimately interweave to reflect Lovecraft's commentary on the human experience, cosmic insignificance, and the existential terror of the unknown, one must first look into Lovecraft's overarching mythos.

The Lovecraftian mythos consists of a universe where ancient, terrifying beings known as the Great Old Ones exist, generally indifferent to the human race but so incomprehensibly vast and powerful that their mere existence generates a sense of dread and hopelessness. These ancient entities are neither benevolent nor malicious in the traditional sense, but rather present an unwavering indifference that emphasizes, as the late H.P. Lovecraft himself so eloquently professed, "the fragile position of humanity in the face of a vast, uncaring universe."

Among the Great Old Ones, we find beings such as Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Dagon, and Shub-Niggurath. They are god-like in their influence and stature but remain alien to the comforting mythologies that humans often attribute to deities in more conventional religious or spiritual contexts. Cthulhu, for example, is a monstrous deity that lies dormant beneath the oceans, trapped in a death-like slumber until the appropriate time for his awakening arrives – a time when the stars align in a specific way.

With the Great Old Ones, we see recurring existential themes of helplessness, insignificance, and irrelevance when confronted with cosmic and universal immensity. Humans are left in the dark, unaware of their own fundamental ignorance and cognitive limitations. These themes reflect humanity's place in the grand cosmic hierarchy, and, as highlighted by Lovecraft's human characters' interactions with these entities, they reveal our futile attempts to understand or control the unfathomable.

Throughout Lovecraft's works, lesser beings like Deep Ones and Mi-Go affiliate themselves with this pantheon of Great Old Ones. These beings often engage in mysterious rituals to honor, appease, or channel the power of their cosmic patrons. The motives of lesser beings may not be entirely clear, but these rituals provide an allegory for the human experience – utilizing cultural and religious practices to grapple with a world that feels inherently chaotic, beyond comprehension, and frightening. The symbols and cults Lovecraft creates around these lesser beings serve to demonstrate the desperate and fumbling aspects of humanity attempting to rationalize and even worship that which they cannot understand.

Lovecraft's stories often intertwine the fragile human psyche with the overwhelming terror of the cosmic unknown. Characters frequently find themselves irreversibly damaged by encounters with the Great Old Ones and their affiliated cosmic entities. They offer a harrowing reminder that to seek out or inadvertently encounter these cosmic truths can result in a complete breakdown of one's mental stability.

In conclusion, Lovecraft's Great Old Ones and their cosmic mythology present an intricate and layered commentary on the human experience, cosmic insignificance, and the existential terror of the unknown. By exploring the existential themes surrounding the ancient entities and the symbolic nature of their rituals and affiliations with lesser beings, Lovecraft adeptly weaves a narrative that reflects humanity’s futile struggle to understand and interact with the vast, uncaring cosmos. This cosmic horror serves both as a cautionary tale against obtaining forbidden knowledge and as a stark reminder of the insignificant role humanity plays in the grand cosmic scheme.
