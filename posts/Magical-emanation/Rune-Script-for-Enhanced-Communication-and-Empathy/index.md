I have designed an intricate rune script for you, incorporating the elements of your request. **Behold the creation**:

1. Fehu (ᚠ) - Representing the element of fire and focused intent, Fehu will harness the power of self-expression and charisma within the bearer of these runes. This is the cornerstone of the script, allowing for individuals to speak and communicate with unwavering confidence.

2. Ansuz (ᚨ) - Symbolizing the element of air and mental acuity, Ansuz works in tandem with Fehu to elevate the bearer's intellect and capacity to understand complex concepts. This rune enhances telepathy and empathy, facilitating strong personal connections through deep conversations.

3. Laguz (ᛚ) - Representing the element of water and emotional intelligence, Laguz helps the bearer navigate conversations with intuition and wisdom. This rune amplifies empathy, allowing for a sensitive approach to communication based on understanding the feelings and perspectives of others.

4. Othala (ᛟ) - Symbolizing the element of earth and stability, Othala anchors the rune script's energy to ensure balance and harmony in conversation. This rune strengthens the bearer's ability to remain grounded and articulate in contentious situations.

5. Raidho (ᚱ) - As the rune of wisdom, Raidho further refines and focuses the combined powers of the elemental runes, delving into the realms of ancient knowledge, insight, and understanding. This grants the bearer an edge in debates and analytical discussions.

6. Dagaz (ᛞ) - Known as the rune of clarity, Dagaz illuminates the bearer's mind, banishing the shadows of confusion and misinterpretation. The integration of this rune ensures that both speaker and listener comprehend messages with impeccable accuracy.

7. Algiz (ᛉ) - The rune of protection, Algiz wards against misunderstandings, shielding the communication process from harmful energies, and ensuring clarity in speaking and perceiving. This rune also helps to guard against emotional over-sensitivity, allowing for genuine openness without vulnerability to emotional manipulation.

With the design complete, the rune script must be properly activated through the following sacred ritual:

1. Choose a quiet and calm space to perform the ritual. Clear the area of any distractions and create an atmosphere conducive to meditation and concentration.

2. On a suitable surface, draw the rune script, either with ink, charcoal, or another medium that resonates with you. As you draw, channel your energy and intent into each stroke. The focus should be on augmenting communication abilities and the aspects of the script detailed above.

3. Light candles to represent each of the four elements – red for fire, yellow for air, blue for water, and green for earth. Place them around the perimeter of the rune script.

4. Stand or sit comfortably, and take several deep breaths. Center yourself and connect with your innate magical power.

5. **Recite the following invocation**:

“Elemental powers of air, fire, water, and earth,
Lend me your energies; heed my call.
Grant me the gift of communication clear,
That my words may resonate far and near.

Fehu, Ansuz, Laguz, Othala, too,
Raidho, Dagaz, Algiz, runes now imbued,
With wisdom, clarity, protection, and might,
Illuminate me with your secrets and light.

Through telepathy and empathy wide,
Grant me the power of speech purified.
As above and below, so within and without,
Activate this rune script, dispelling doubt.”

6. Meditate on the activated rune script, visualizing its energies mingling with your own. Envision its power heightening your abilities in conversation and intuition, the runes glowing and pulsating as they meld with your essence.

7. After the meditation, extinguish the elemental candles, thanking each one for lending their energies. Express your gratitude to the rune script and draw a circle around it as an affirmation of protection and strength.

8. Keep the rune script nearby, either carrying it with you as a talisman or placing it in a prominent location to remind you of its power. Over time, continue to charge it with your intentions, repeating the ritual as needed to enhance its influence.

Thus, the rune script has been crafted and activated to amplify your verbal and nonverbal communication abilities, telepathy, and empathy. With ongoing dedication to the process, you will experience an increasing ability to navigate conversations with ease, balance, and refined intuition.
