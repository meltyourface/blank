## Terra Ascendit

1. **Origins and Manifestations of Geomantic Power**:

In the world of Terra Ascendit, Geomancy reigns supreme as the main conduit for magical abilities. **The art is governed by four core elemental forces**: Earth, Air, Water, and Fire. Alongside these forces, cosmic alignments and subterranean energies play significant roles in the manifestation and manipulation of geomantic power.

Geomancers draw upon these elements, cosmic alignments, and energies from deep within the Earth to harness transformative abilities that enable them to control their surroundings and create phenomena. Adepts must internalize, balance, and channel these forces, which are interconnected by celestial tides and the Earth's pulsing core.

2. **Geomantic Disciplines**:

Various disciplines evolved within the world of Geomancy, each with its own intricate practices and mythologies.

- Lithomancy revolves around divination and control of the elements through the casting of stones. Founded by the sage Lithor, lithomancers possess powerful abilities to shift earth, raise islands, or tear apart the ground beneath their opponents.

- Crystallomancy involves channeling geomantic energies through crystals with specialized lunar alignment. Renowned for their healing and divination arts, crystallomancers were introduced by the founding sage, Crystallis, who was known to bend light and navigate cosmic forces.

- Ceraunoscopy focuses on interpreting and controlling the energies of lightning, thunder, and storms. Founded by the sage Cerauno, these geomancers are typically shrouded in secrecy and hold great power in governmental circles, due to their ability to control weather and warfare.

3. **Diverse Cultures and Societies**:

Several civilizations developed around the manipulation of geomantic energies and alliances. **Among these are**:

- Clado-Terrans: Earth-centric and centered around agriculture, they are reliant on lithomancy to till the soil and create fertile lands.
- Aquamagna: Water dwellers who excel in maritime navigation and exploration, utilizing the geomantic elements of water and air.
- Ignis Dominus: Fiery warriors who master the geomancy of fire, known for their fierce combat skills and mastery of metalwork.

Competition and cooperation between these distinct civilizations are driven by unique interpretations of the ancient geomantic arts, leading to intense rivalries and alliances.

4. **Mythology**:

The mythology of Terra Ascendit centers on the "Great Balance," which holds that Earth, Air, Water, and Fire must be maintained in harmony to ensure cosmic alignment and subterranean stability. **Key figures in the mythology include**:

- Quattuor: The creator deity who first harnessed geomantic power to forge the world.
- Elementum Sages: Four wise sages (Lithor, Crystallis, Cerauno, and Ignis) who embodied the respective disciplines of Geomancy, establishing the foundation of geomantic arts.

5. **Conflict**:

An epic, multilayered conflict has erupted among rival factions of geomancers vying for supremacy. These factions, each rooted in their ideology and interpretation of the world's history and lore, include:

- The Lithogravitists, led by descendants of the Clado-Terrans, seek control over magnetic forces to plunge the world into a new age of harmony.
- The Crystalline Order, consisting mainly of Aquamagna members, aims to utilize intensified lunar alignments to create the ultimate healing nexus.
- The Stormbringers, comprised of Ignis Dominus followers, desire domination over weather to control both land and seas.

6. **Secretive Language**:

The world of Geomancy contains a secretive language known as Terrascriptum, accessible only to initiated geomancers. This specialized language consists of complex symbols, glyphs, and phrases representing the forces of Geomancy. This cohesive and immersive system of communication incorporates a multitude of symbols representing elements, techniques, and elemental control patterns, allowing geomancers to tap into the ancient knowledge contained within the enigmatic art.
