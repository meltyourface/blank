description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Life-blood of the Saints, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Compose an elaborate ritualistic chant incorporating the divine powers of the Life-blood of the Saints to methodically purge and sanctify a designated space, dispelling all malignant energies and malevolent forces. This chant should include precise invocations of at least three revered Saints, the mystical properties of their Life-blood, and the specific steps or actions to be performed in tandem with the recital. Moreover, integrate an evocative stanza to amplify the potency of the chant and incorporate time-tested symbols or sigils to strengthen the spiritual connection.

[Recorded Chant: The Purification of Sanctified Space]

In the name of the Eternal and the Unfathomable,
We gather in the sacred presence of Saints divine,
Calling forth their Life-blood, power entwined.
To consecrate this space, to cleanse and purify,
By their will and grace, darkness shall now flee.

- Step One: Light the candles in a circle around the space, imbuing them with the intention of purification.

Saint Michael of the Immaculate Vengeance,
Warrior divine, your Life-blood, silver flames blaze,
Wield your celestial sword, the shadows laying waste.

- Action One: Call upon Saint Michael to guard the perimeter as you draw his sigil upon the entrance with your finger.

(Beloved protector — Michael's sigil:
Within an equilateral cross inscribe a sword,
With an added scale of justice, balance is restored.)

Saint Therese of the Boundless Love,
Healing hands, your Life-blood flows from above,
Ignite the hearts of men, the wickedness dissolve.

- Step Two: As you chant Saint Therese's name, envision the space engulfed in a warm, loving light that removes all afflictions from the souls present.

( Shepherd of humanity — Therese's symbol profound:
A shower of roses inside a radiant heart be found.)

Saint Christopher, the Traveler's Guide,
Steadfast and strong, your Life-blood allied,
Carry us through the darkness, our path align.

- Action Two: Hold a small relic of Saint Christopher as you walk three times around the space, tracing an unbroken line of sanctity.

(Cherished Guardian — Christopher's sign:
Amidst the stormy waves, a steadfast ship we design.)

By the mystical powers of these Saints revered,
With heart and hands, Life-blood now cohered,
A sacred space, protected, the darkness cleared.

- Evocative Stanza:

In the ethereal glow, these Saints unite,
The resounding echoes of their voices ignite,
The celestial veil cracked, their power ignites.

- Step Three: Sprinkle sanctified salt across the threshold, sealing this space from malignant spirits and their strife.

In the holy names of Michael, Therese, and Christopher,
With reverence and devotion, their blessings delivered.
In this sanctified space, may only light now linger.
