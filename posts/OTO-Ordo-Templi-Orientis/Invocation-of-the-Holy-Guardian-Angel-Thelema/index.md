  Compose an intricate poetic invocation, steeped in the mysticism of the OTO Ordo Templi Orientis, dedicated to summoning one's personal Holy Guardian Angel. Incorporate symbols and concepts specific to the OTO, such as the Tree of Life, Aleister Crowley's Thelema teachings, and the hexagram ritual, to enrich the depth and potency of the invocation.

In the sacred chamber of Nuit's embrace,
Where dualities merge beneath the starry grace,
Upon the altar of the Highest Will,
I stand, prepared the Veil to still.

By the authority of the Ordo Templi Orientis,
And the secret wisdom of its mighty gnosis,
Through the Tree of Life, the flaming branches igniting,
I call upon the divine to enlight the hexagram uniting.

From Kether to Malkuth, the ineffable path trod,
By the Master's hand, Aleister Crowley's rod,
I claim my right to embark upon the Great Work,
The Knowledge and Conversation, I shall not shirk.

In the name of Babalon and Chaos conjoined,
Grant my wish, O masters, wisdom anointed,
With sword and cup, and wand and disk,
Unseal the way, the voice of the abyss.

As Nuit and Hadit's union alights in the night,
The Earth is mothered by the All-Father's might,
Thelema's Law, guiding my stride,
Love is the law, love under will, inside.

Hexagram of the Heavens, mirrored below,
An interwoven dance of macrocosmic flow,
Seal of Solomon, twisting serpents aspire,
Unite Sun and Moon, my heart's desire.

Raise the sacred chant, ancient words resound,
ARARITA, the secret formula unbound,
I summon thee, my Holy Guardian Angel, divine,
Come forth, unite, thy knowledge with mine.

Guide me, shape me, direct me to the path,
My divine intuition, my spiritual epitaph,
Lead me through Adeptship as the Rose Cross blooms,
Beyond the Deception, the Limitless Room.

Let the hidden masters look on and acclaim,
This sacred union, celestial flame,
For I am the serpent who rises in might,
And my Guardian Angel doth bring me the Light.

I invoke thee, O Angel, thou art my guide true,
Let thy voice intertwine the Earth's sinew,
Exalt me as I merge with thy essence to become,
One with the Universe, the path of the sun.

In the name of the Ordo Templi Orientis,
My oath is sealed, my purpose granted.
One word: ABRAHADABRA, my invocation done,
My soul merges now, and forever, with the one.
