## Rite of the Revealing Crystal

Purpose: To establish a deep connection with the True Will and the inner self, utilizing the tools of a consecrated crystal ball, invocations, and visualization techniques.

Preparation:

1. Prepare the ritual space with a clean and stable altar, facing east.
2. Place the consecrated crystal ball at the center of the altar. Surround it with a circle of lit candles, representing the Light of the Divine or the True Will.
3. **Arrange the following tools on the altar**:
   a. A chalice filled with water
   b. A burning incense
   c. A dagger or sword
   d. A pentacle or disk
4. Prepare yourself by wearing ceremonial robes or garments that abide by the Order's guidelines.
**Step 1**: Sanctification of the Ritual Space

1. Stand in the west of the room, facing east.
2. Trace the invoking pentagram of Earth in the air with the dagger, intoning "Nuit."
3. Sprinkle water from the chalice on the ground, saying "Purification."
4. Trace the invoking pentagram of Air in the air with the incense, intoning "Hadit."
5. Pass the burning incense over the ground, saying "Consecration."
6. Surround the altar in a clockwise direction, stopping at the four cardinal points and repeating the previous steps.
7. Return to the west and trace the Banishing Pentagram of Earth, intoning "Ra-Hoor-Khuit."
**Step 2**: Invocation of the Elements and the True Will

1. Stand in the east, facing the altar.
2. ****Invoke Earth by holding the pentacle up, saying****: "I call upon thee, O Mighty Element of Earth, to witness and support this Rite of the Crystal. Thy steadfastness and strength shall be my foundation."
3. ****Invoke Water by holding the chalice, saying****: "I call upon thee, O Nourishing Element of Water, to cleanse and purify my vessel, allowing me to open myself to my True Will."
4. ****Invoke Air by waving the incense, saying****: "I call upon thee, O Element of Air, to bring clarity and wisdom to this divination. May my thoughts and communication be guided by the Light of my True Will."
5. ****Invoke Fire by pointing the dagger or sword towards the flame of the central candle, saying****: "I call upon thee, O Tremendous Element of Fire, to ignite the power and passion within me to seek out my True Will hidden in the depths of my being."
6. ****Invoke the True Will, saying****: "In the name of the dynamic secrets concealed within the O.T.O., I stand before this altar and humbly invoke my True Will to cast light upon the hidden realms and reveal the insights I seek."
**Step 3**: Scrying in the Crystal

1. Take a deep breath and close your eyes. Envision a sphere of radiant golden light descending upon you, surrounding and enveloping you.
2. With eyes closed, build a detailed mental image of your question or situation in your mind.
3. Slowly open your eyes, and gaze into the consecrated crystal ball.
4. Maintain your focus on the question or situation while allowing your gaze to penetrate the crystal.
5. Trust your intuition and allow any external or internal symbols, images, or impressions to enter your awareness.
6. Note these images and messages mentally or jot them down if desired.
**Step 4**: Closing the Ritual

1. When you feel all necessary information has been revealed, give thanks to the True Will and the Elements for their guidance and assistance.
2. ****Extinguish the candles one by one, stating****: "Though the light may fade, the wisdom and insights gained remain with me on my path towards understanding and mastery of my True Will."
3. Close with the O.T.O. motto, "Love is the law, love under will."

Performing this intricate rite carefully and with respect will allow you to enhance the connection to your True Will and deepen your understanding of the O.T.O. principles. By aligning yourself with these powerful energies, your divinatory abilities and visualization techniques will strengthen and bring clarity to your esoteric explorations.
