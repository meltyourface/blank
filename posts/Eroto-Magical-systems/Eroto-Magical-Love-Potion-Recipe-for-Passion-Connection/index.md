To concoct an Eroto-Magical love potion that satisfies the requirements, we will synergize the aphrodisiac properties of commonly available herbs, creating an enchanting, multi-sensory experience for the imbiber. **The potion will consist of the following elements**:

Ingredients:
1. Damiana (Turnera diffusa) - A known aphrodisiac and energy stimulant.
2. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - Enhances dream states and intuition.
3. Rose petals (Rosa spp.) - Symbolizes love and passion.
4. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) - Stimulates passion and increases heat in the body.
5. Vanilla (Vanilla planifolia) - Enhances sensuality and euphoria.
6. Orange zest (Citrus sinensis) - Adds high vibrational energy and boosts mood.

Color, Symbols, and Incantations:
- Color: Use shades of red and pink to symbolize love and passion, as well as shades of purple to represent intuition and spiritual connection.
- Symbols: Draw the Venus symbol (circle with a cross below it) and the infinity symbol (horizontal figure-eight) on the potion bottle using lavender or rose essential oil. These symbols help to infuse the potion with Eroto-Magical intent and attract harmonious energies.
- Incantation: Recite "Amoris et passionis venite ad me, ardentes desiderium spirituum elementorum; Ad harmoniam pulsationes revelant" (Love and passion flow to me, fiery desire from elemental spirits; Reveal the harmony within) while stirring the potion in a clockwise direction.

Historical and Esoteric Inspiration:
- Incorporate elements from ancient Egypt's rituals of love, such as inhaling the aroma of rose petals and incorporating sacred oils.
- Implement sensuous aspects of Indian tantric rituals, focusing on balancing the chakras and awakening Kundalini energy.
- Utilize elements from the Wiccan tradition of creating love spells, including herbal magic and sacred geometry.

Scent Profile:
- Combine the natural aromatic properties of damiana, rose petals, cinnamon, and vanilla to create an intoxicatingly sweet and spicy scent that tantalizes the senses and evokes an alluring atmosphere.

Multi-Step Brewing Process:
1. Begin the process on a night when the moon is waxing (increasing in size) to harmonize with the lunar energies of growth and attraction.
2. Combine the damiana, mugwort, rose petals, cinnamon, and orange zest. Place the mixture in a glass jar.
3. Infuse the herbs with boiling water and let it steep for 10 minutes.
4. In a separate container, mix a teaspoon of ground vanilla bean with an ounce of brandy. Let it sit for at least 24 hours.
5. Strain the herb-infused water into a clean jar and add the vanilla-brandy mixture.
6. Charge the potion under the light of the full moon with positive intentions.

By incorporating these ideas and techniques, you will create an Eroto-Magical love potion that transcends the mundane, taps into the ethereal plane, and leaves an unforgettable, mystical impression on the heart and senses of the intended recipient. Remember that the potion's power lies in the intent, symbolism, and connection to the esoteric within yourself and the cosmos.
