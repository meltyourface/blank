  In which Eroto-Magical systems can you identify the intersection between the alchemical principle of Solve et Coagula, the Kabbalistic idea of the Divine Union, and the tantric concept of Kundalini energy, and how do these seemingly distinct elements interweave to manifest transformative and transcendental erotic experiences for practitioners?

To answer this knowledge challenge, we must understand the foundations and interconnections of the alchemical principle of Solve et Coagula, the Kabbalistic idea of the Divine Union, and the tantric concept of Kundalini energy. Each of these elements brings a unique aspect to the Eroto-Magical systems and, when combined, can lead practitioners to transformative and transcendental erotic experiences. 

Let us first establish the fundamental ideas of each component:

1. **Solve et Coagula**: This alchemical principle suggests a process of dissolving (solve) and recombining (coagula) elements, resulting in the transformation of matter and consciousness. In the context of Eroto-Magical systems, the union of opposites, such as masculine and feminine energies, leads to spiritual development and transformation.

2. **Kabbalistic Divine Union**: In Kabbalah, Divine Union refers to the concept of unification between the feminine and masculine aspects of the divine, known as Shekhinah (Divine Presence) and Tiferet (Beauty). Kabbalists aim to balance and merge these divine principles within themselves, attending to the energetic, emotional, and spiritual realms to create a harmonious existence.

3. **Kundalini Energy**: Kundalini, in tantra, is a form of divine feminine energy that lies dormant at the base of the spine until it's awakened through various spiritual practices. Kundalini energy ascends through the seven chakras, purifying and transforming the practitioner's consciousness, leading them to spiritual awakening and liberation.

The intersection of these three elements can be found primarily in Western esotericism and modern Eroto-Magical systems, such as Western sex magick, Thelema, and Chaos Magick. These practices often incorporate elements from diverse spiritual traditions, forging a complex connection between various mystical teachings.

In the context of Eroto-Magical systems, the alchemical principle of Solve et Coagula works in parallel with the Kabbalistic idea of Divine Union. Sexual practices and encounters are perceived as alchemical processes where the merging of male and female energies (similar to Shekhinah and Tiferet) leads to the dissolution of the practitioner's ego, forging a higher consciousness. This transformative experience aims to elevate the individual spiritually.

Simultaneously, the raising of Kundalini energy through tantric practices involving breath control, visualization, and sexual union aligns with the concepts of Solve et Coagula and Divine Union. When the Kundalini energy awakens, it dissolves the obstructions in the practitioner's chakras (solve) and unifies with the masculine energy, creating a new perception of reality (coagula).

These seemingly distinct elements interweave in Eroto-Magical systems to create a transformative and transcendental erotic experience for practitioners by:

1. Unifying and balancing the feminine and masculine aspects within the individual, leading to personal harmony and spiritual growth.
2. Dissolving the ego and transcending duality, allowing the practitioner to connect with a higher state of consciousness and unity.
3. Purifying and transforming the individual's energy system through the activation of Kundalini, helping them reach spiritual liberation.

In conclusion, the intersection of Solve et Coagula, the Kabbalistic Divine Union, and the tantric Kundalini energy is found in contemporary Western esotericism and Eroto-Magical systems that integrate various spiritual traditions. This melding enables practitioners to experience transformative and transcendental erotic encounters that foster personal growth, spiritual awakening, and a deeper understanding of the self and the divine.
