- Learning to spread: Study different spreads and use the ones that are most suitable for the particular reading or situation.

B. Runes
- Crafting or acquiring runes: Runes can be made from various materials such as wood, stone, or clay. Craft them yourself or purchase a set that resonates with your energy.
- Studying rune meanings: Familiarize yourself with the traditional interpretations of each rune, as well as any personal symbolism associated with them.
- Drawing runes: Develop a method for drawing runes, either by casting or randomly selecting them, while concentrating on a question.
- Interpreting rune combinations: Analyze the relationship between the runes in the reading and synthesize their meanings to form a coherent message.
