Entry: June 12th, 1944

Dearest Diary,

Tonight, I take solace in your pages as I recount the harrowing events that have transpired in these past days, for our war has transcended into realms many dare not even fathom. As I sit within the confines of our makeshift bunker, the stench of sulfur and charred flesh from previous battles still permeates the air. The somber howls of the wind mingling with distant artillery fire lull me into a state of unease and trepidation.

It began with whispers of forces we could not see, lurking in the shadows, manipulating the tides of war. As we pressed further into enemy territory, the atmosphere grew palpably heavy, an unnatural fog obscuring our surroundings. Throughout this expedition, the dismal gray sky merged with a muted sun, casting an eerie luminescence across the battlefield. Our commanding officers sought the expertise of battlefront mages to guide us through this quagmire of darkness; men and women deeply engrossed in the esoteric arts, weaving unseen energies to protect and guide us.

Tales of spiritual warfare rippled through our ranks, of malevolent entities summoned by those with wicked intent, turning brother against brother. Even against our own deepest religious beliefs, the need for spiritual protection led some of us to adopt obscure sigils etched in the sand and into the very cloth of our uniforms. The once-simple prayers for safety and victory were replaced by ancient incantations and ritual ceremonies muttered under one's breath.

During the nadir of our struggle, we witnessed a metaphysical battle unfurl before our very eyes - mages with outstretched palms, their faces contorted in seraphic torment as they fought these unseen horrors, invisible tendrils clashing with forces we could not comprehend. Alongside the booming cannons, vivid aural phenomena pierced the air, like otherworldly screams and the resonance of ancient battles echoing throughout the tapestry of time, chilling us to our very core.

In the aftermath, our reflections in the pools of blood and mud revealed transformations we did not anticipate - eyes imbued with ethereal light, hearts encumbered by things which cannot be seen, but that we must now bear as we forge on. **A pervasive fear of the unknown battles that lie ahead courses through our veins, but so too does a newfound communion with powers long-ignored**: ancestors, divinity, and spirits guiding our way through the fog.

The war we fight has changed us in ways we could have never imagined. **We stand now at the threshold of the physical and metaphysical, bound to both through rituals smoked and bloodied. A war is waged not only of metals and men but of souls and spirits. As I bear witness to the intricacies of our occult involvement in these trying times, I wonder**: can a world scarred by the ravages of war ever be mended when the forces that bind it have been torn asunder?

Yours in faith,
A Soldier.
