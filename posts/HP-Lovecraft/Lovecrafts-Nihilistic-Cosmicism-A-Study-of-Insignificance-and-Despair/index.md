To address this knowledge challenge, let's first begin by defining and understanding the key concepts involved:

1. Cosmicism: Cosmicism is a philosophical view that emphasizes the insignificance of humanity in the vast, indifferent cosmos. It posits that humans are not at the center of any cosmic drama and are rather inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.

2. Nihilism: Nihilism is a belief in the pointlessness of existence, characterized by a sense of despair and cynicism.

3. Fictional deities: Lovecraft created a pantheon of fictional deities, known collectively as the Cthulhu Mythos. These deities, such as Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Azathoth, and Yog-Sothoth, are depicted as beings of immense power, utterly indifferent or even hostile to human life.

With these key concepts defined, let's now explore the significance of the conjuncture between Lovecraft's personal philosophy of cosmicism, as displayed in his stories, and the nihilistic atmosphere that permeates his fiction.

To begin, Lovecraft's cosmicism is embodied by the vast, uncaring cosmos he presents in his stories, where humans are utterly insignificant. This is illustrated through the use of vast, incomprehensible scales of time and space, and by the presence of his fictional deities who exist beyond human comprehension. Within this universe, Lovecraft establishes a general atmosphere of nihilism, as his characters often fail to make sense of the world and their place in it.

One notable example is "The Call of Cthulhu," where the titular deity is described as a being of unfathomable power, slumbering beneath the ocean. Its very existence challenges humanity's understanding of the cosmos, and contact with the creature drives humans to madness and despair. This is emblematic of the larger theme of Lovecraftian cosmicism — the idea that there are forces at play in the universe that are far beyond human comprehension and have no regard for us. Thus, the presence of Cthulhu and other such deities serves to emphasize the inherent nihilism in Lovecraft's stories.

Similarly, in the narrative of "At the Mountains of Madness," the characters discover traces of ancient beings known as the Elder Things, who once ruled Earth long before humans came into existence. This discovery illustrates, once again, humanity's small and insignificant role in the grand cosmic scale. Realizing that they have stumbled upon something beyond their grasp, the protagonists are struck by despair and helplessness.

The nihilistic atmosphere in Lovecraft's stories is further exacerbated by the knowledge that his human characters often suffer disastrous consequences when they try to engage with or understand these cosmic truths. For instance, in "The Shadow Over Innsmouth," the protagonist's efforts to confront the hidden, otherworldly menace in the town ultimately leads him to a horrific personal revelation — a discovery that shatters his understanding of his own humanity.

In conclusion, HP Lovecraft's personal philosophy of cosmicism and the nihilistic atmosphere in his fiction are inextricably linked. His vision of an indifferent cosmos, populated by incomprehensible and indifferent deities, serves to underline themes of despair, meaninglessness, and futility in the face of a vast, uncaring universe. By incorporating these themes into his stories, Lovecraft forces both his characters and his readers to confront the fundamental insignificance of humanity and the limits of human comprehension, resulting in the pervasive sense of nihilism that so characterizes his work.
