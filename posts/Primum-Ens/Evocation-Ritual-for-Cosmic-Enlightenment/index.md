description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Primum Ens, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Craft a bespoke ceremonial rite for the evocation of a particular Primum Ens entity, delving into the intricacies of ancient arcane symbols, mystic chants, and the use of cardinal substances relevant to the being in question.

## Evocation of Semetherea, the Primum Ens of Cosmic Enlightenment

Preparatory Steps:

1. **Mindset and Intent**: At least one week prior to the ritual, begin focusing your intent on connecting with Semetherea, the Primum Ens of cosmic enlightenment. Reflect on your purpose and envision the clarity and wisdom you seek.

2. **Cleansing and Purification**: Perform a series of purifying actions leading up to the ritual to prepare yourself and your ritual space. This includes physical cleanliness, abstaining from negative habits and influences, and reciting daily affirmations of dedication.

3. **Astral Alignment**: Three days before the ceremony, conduct an astral meditation session each evening to align your energies with the cosmic forces and open your subconscious to the workings of the ritual.

Main Ritualistic Procedure:

1. **Setting Sacred Space**: Find a quiet, undisturbed location where you can perform the ritual undisturbed. Create a sacred circle with a nine-foot diameter, using salt, herbs, and crushed obsidian. In the center, set up an altar with a pillar candle, a brazier for incense, and an offering of star-shaped crystals.

2. **Invoke the Cardinal Points**: At each cardinal direction (North, East, South, West), draw the Sigil of Semetherea with a mix of sacred ash and ink made with alkaline plants. Recite the Invocation of the Cardinal Points, summoning the elemental energies to guard and aid in the evocation.

3. **Light the Candle and Incense**: Light the pillar candle while chanting the Ignition Hymn, followed by the incense blend (frankincense, myrrh, and sandalwood) to invite Semetherea's attention to your sacred space.

4. **Chant the Hymn of Semetherea**: With clear intention and steady focus, chant the Hymn of Semetherea nine times, singing louder and with increasing confidence as the energy swells.

5. **Evocation of Semetherea**: Recite the Evocation of Semetherea, calling upon the spirit to join you in the ritual space:

"Semetherea, Primum Ens of Cosmic Enlightenment,
Flowing through the splendor of starlight beyond mortal reach,
Heed my call and descend upon this humble realm,
I beseech your presence and the wisdom you impart,
By name and sigil, I summon thee,
May our bond transcend spatial boundaries,

Semetherea, grant me your illumination."

6. **Energy Channeling**: Draw sacred geometric patterns in the air around you, directing the energy toward your heart chakra. Focus the vibration of the chant and the presence of Semetherea into your core.

Protection Measures:

1. Following the evocation, state the Invocation of Cosmic Armor, requesting protection from any malevolent energies that might accompany Semethereaâ€™s arrival.

2. Surround yourself with a circle of purified salt in your sacred space to provide a barrier of energetic protection.

3. Wear an amulet of your chosen protective symbol (eye of Horus, pentagram, etc.) during the duration of the ritual.

Post-Ritual Sequence:

1. **Express Gratitude**: Upon concluding the evocation and communing with Semetherea, express your gratitude for their presence and the wisdom shared, followed by a closing recitation to gracefully end the ritual.

2. **Close the Cardinal Points**: Repeat Steps 2 and 6 in reverse order to close each cardinal direction, sealing off the protective energies and returning to your world.

3. **Cleanse Yourself and Space**: Perform a thorough cleansing of yourself and the ritual space to dissipate any remaining spiritual energies, using purifying incense and visualization techniques.

4. **Reflect and Record**: Take time after the ceremony to reflect on the experience, and record any new insights, wisdom, or revelations in your personal grimoire for future reference.

By following the bespoke ceremonial rite outlined above, you will maximize the potency and efficacy of your evocation, ultimately forging a profound connection with Semetherea, the Primum Ens of cosmic enlightenment.
