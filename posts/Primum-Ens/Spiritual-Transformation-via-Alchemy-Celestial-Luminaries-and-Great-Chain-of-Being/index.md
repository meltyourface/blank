To fully appreciate the connections between the alchemical process, celestial luminaries, and the Great Chain of Being in the context of Primum Ens, we must start by defining and understanding each of these concepts.

Primum Ens, stemming from the Latin phrase "Primum Ens Melissae," refers to the concept of "being" as the primordial, original essence of all things. It is the foundation from which reality is formed, and it encompasses the spiritual energy that permeates throughout existence.

The alchemical process is an ancient metaphysical practice with roots in various cultures that seek to purify and transform base matter (lead) into more refined and spiritually significant matter (gold). This process is not just about the literal transformation of elements but also represents the transformation of the self to achieve a spiritually perfected state.

Celestial luminaries represent the planets, stars, and other heavenly bodies in the cosmos, each with their own unique energy, vibration, and significance. In esoteric and occult traditions, these celestial bodies are believed to have a profound influence on our lives, and their energies can be harnessed for transformation and growth.

The Great Chain of Being refers to a hierarchical structure of existence, where everything is interconnected and interrelated. This chain begins with the divine or God at the top, followed by angels, humans, animals, plants, and minerals, down to the elemental forces of nature.

Now, let's delve into the connections between these three concepts and outline the process of spiritual transformation through the harnessing of celestial energies and alchemical processes aligned with the Great Chain of Being. 

First, the alchemical process correlates with celestial luminaries through the idea of "as above, so below." This ancient aphorism means that the macrocosm (celestial bodies and energies) is reflected within the microcosm (the individual human experience). To harness the energies of celestial luminaries, an adept must first study and understand the influences of planets, stars, and their corresponding energies, and then apply this knowledge to the manipulation and transformation of their own inner states.

Second, the alchemical process also mirrors the hierarchical structure of the Great Chain of Being. The goal of the alchemical process is to progress upwards through the different levels of the Chain in order to achieve spiritual unity with the divine source. This spiritual transformation connects with celestial luminaries, as they assist the adept in attuning themselves to the divine will and purifying their spiritual essence.

Lastly, as an adept hones their spiritual practices and knowledge, they learn how to effectively utilize celestial energies and their own inherent spiritual power in order to ascend the Great Chain of Being. This holistic and comprehensive understanding of spiritual evolution involves the mastery of the alchemical process alongside the deep awareness of the interconnected web of existence.

In conclusion, the connections between the alchemical process, celestial luminaries, and the Great Chain of Being are vital for adepts seeking spiritual transformation. By appreciating and mastering the relationships between these concepts, the adept can achieve unity with the divine source and ascend the Great Chain of Being. The key themes in this response include the refinement of self through alchemy, the importance of understanding and harnessing celestial energies, and the necessity of comprehending the interconnected structure of existence in achieving spiritual growth.
