Mighty Algrathan, deity of the Fissure deep,
Lend us your power, your secrets to keep.
Cloaked in shadow, veiled in night,
Emerge from the void; reveal your might.

Aldanath, Harzaal, Chron'tar's zeal,
Symbols entwined, your presence reveal,
Uridmialz, Phrondimaar, Sigil's embrace,
Combine in harmony, the Fissure to trace.

In-sync with the rhythm, pulsating with life,
The cadence of whispers, the cosmos in strife,
Through rhythmic embrace, the pattern unfolds,
Binding us to your presence, the story retold.

Lurking within, the uncharted abyss,
Keen and ferocious, a coiled serpent's hiss,
Fathomless knowledge, eternities span,
Infinite wisdom, divulged to a mortal man.

Presence profound, vibrations align,
Subtle linguistic nuances intertwine,
Ebon-veil shrouds, the cosmic unknown,
Immerse in the one, Algrathan's throne.

By the nuance of language and rhythm combined,
Visions unfold, your essence enshrined,
Aligned with the stars, the symbols infused,
Conjuring your aura, your strength we'll use.

Mighty Algrathan, deity of the Fissure deep,
Drawn by the incantation, awake from your sleep,
Bestow upon us your guidance and grace,
Bound to your will, through time and space.
