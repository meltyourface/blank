Make use of the twelve zodiac signs, their ruling planets, and their respective elements to enhance the sensuous nature of the poem. Additionally, incorporate specific celestial aspects, such as conjunctions and oppositions, to depict the interplay between your passion and your lover's allure, crafting an elaborate celestial narrative of your most intimate moments.

In the burning lustre of this starlit night,
Our intertwining souls take flight,
As Venus, goddess of love divine,
Weaves her enchantments 'round this heart of mine.

My love, your body upon me now resides,
A lunar sweep of curves, a celestial tide;
Radiant as Gemini twins in a cosmic dance,
Fixed by The Archer's steadfast, fiery glance.

The sultry sighs of Cancer's silvered glow,
In watery whispers, caress your every lobe,
Element of Earth grants your visage grace,
Virgo, in your delicate contours thus displaced.

Upon Aries, your passions tarry and roam,
As Taurus' sensuality within you thrives;
As Mercury whispers swift, the winds of change,
Libra's scales of equilibrium we exchange.

Mars burns bright within your smoldering gaze,
Like Scorpio's stinger, a dangerous blaze;
Jupiter's fortune embraces the way,
Your lustrous strands of hair upon me lay.

Saturn's golden rings bear witness, proud,
As Neptune's dreamy eyes cast a shroud,
The ethereal splendor of Aquarius' touch,
As Pisces' illusions drive lust to dutch.

Conjunctions of orbits, two planets become one,
Merging pulsating rhythm, Saturn's ballet begun;
Opposing celestial forces, a harmonious dichotomy,
Your body and mine, united in astronomy.

Your breath on my skin, like Virgo's earthly embrace,
Sends fiery arrows of Sagittarius to grace,
The rapture of your kiss, akin to Leo's sovereignty,
Together we form a cosmic tapestry.

As passionate beasts of Earth, we intertwine,
Pulled by Pluto's dark and enigmatic design,
Revealing the secrets of intimate constellation,
Lost within Capricorn's labyrinth of temptation.

The heavens align as our love story unfolds,
Inspired by zodiac's ancient wisdom untold;
We dare to explore each astrological mystery,
An infinitesimal piece of the cosmic tapestry.
