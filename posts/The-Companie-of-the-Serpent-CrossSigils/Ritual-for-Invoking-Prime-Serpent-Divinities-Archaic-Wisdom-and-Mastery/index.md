Ritual Invocation of the Prime Serpent Divinities: The Unveiling of Hidden Mysteries and Mastery of Obscure Arts

### I. Preparation 

1. In a sacred circle, draw the central Serpent Cross Sigil using a substance infused with serpent's venom, with each arm of the Cross pointing to the four elemental quarters.
2. In each of the four elemental quarters, place a symbol representing the element: a censor filled with fragrant incense (Air); a chalice filled with water (Water); a candle burning with a strong flame (Fire); and a stone embedded with the essence of the earth (Earth).
3. Dress in a ritual robe adorned with Serpent sigils, and anoint yourself with the sacred oil comprised of serpent's blood, nightshade, and serpentstone.

### II. Invoking the Prime Serpent Divinities

1. Stand in the center of the Serpent Cross Sigil and close your eyes. Begin to visualize the five Prime Serpent Divinities: Ophis the Cosmic Serpent, the eternal spiraling essence of existence; Naga the Guardian, the embodiment of the great threshold between worlds; Ananta the Infinite, the limitless and timeless watcher; Echidna the Mother, the womb from which all serpentine wisdom unfolds; and Apophis the Chaos Bringer, the untamable force of transformation and renewal. 

2. Chant the following sacred phrases to invoke their presence:

  "Ophis Súuarel Ìeyo, Naga Typanís Sile, Ananta Rúnebi Yoé,  Echidna Selyàl Okra, Apophis Vóreon Çil.  Unítesu, Serpent Divinities Prime, wisdom archaic reveal, mysteries eldritch unveil. I beseech thee, heed my call, in the name of the Serpent Cross Sigils and with the power of thy sacred symbols, bless this space and this vessel  with the secrets of the universe and mastery of the obscure arts."

3. When the chant is complete, raise your arms to the heavens and feel the power of the Prime Serpent Divinities pulsing through your body, their ancient energies now swirling within you.

### III. Reception of Ancient Wisdom

1. Open your eyes and gaze upon the Serpent Cross Sigil, letting the sacred symbols dance before your eyes, revealing the fabric of the universe and weaving arcane patterns in time and space.
2. As you do so, the Prime Serpent Divinities shall impart glimpses of hidden knowledge and the mastery of obscure arts. Embrace these teachings, allowing their transformative energies to course within you.

### IV. Closing the Ritual

1. When you are ready, thank the Prime Serpent Divinities for their guidance, wisdom, and empowerment:
  
  "Ophis Súuarel Ìeyo, Naga Typanís Sile, Ananta Rúnebi Yoé,  Echidna Selyàl Okra, Apophis Vóreon Çil.  I thank thee for thine ancient wisdom, for unveiling the secrets held deep, for the mastery of obscure arts, and for the power that now seeps. Let us walk in endless harmony, emboldened by serpentine grace, As carriers of The Companie of the Serpent Cross Sigils, and guardians of the sacred space."

2. Extinguish the elemental symbols in reverse order (Earth, Fire, Water, Air) and erase or remove the Serpent Cross Sigil from the circle's center.

3. With the wisdom of the Prime Serpent Divinities now engraved upon your spirit, depart from the sacred circle to harness the power of The Companie of the Serpent Cross Sigils and continue your journey in mastering the esoteric arts and unveiling the hidden truths that permeate the universe.
