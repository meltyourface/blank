## The Companie of the Serpent CrossSigils: History, Symbolism, and Invocation Techniques

### I. Introduction

The Companie of the Serpent CrossSigils (CSCS) is a powerful and ancient system of esoteric knowledge and practice, with roots that stretch across many occult traditions. For students seeking to cultivate a deep understanding of the CSCS and its role in occult practices, it is essential to first comprehend its historical context, symbolism, and practical techniques. In this text, we aim to provide a comprehensive yet concise introduction to these crucial aspects.

### II. Historical Context

The origins of the CSCS date back to the pre-Christian era, and its development is entwined with the beliefs and practices of ancient cultures. Among these are the Egyptians, Babylonians, Sumerians, and the Gnostics. It is a hybrid tradition that has evolved alongside Western occult systems such as Hermeticism, Qabbalah, and Theurgy, incorporating elements of each to create a unique and potent collection of teachings.

Throughout the centuries, members of the Companie have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of the hidden forces at work within the world. Scholars, mystics, and practitioners have contributed and preserved the knowledge base, even during periods of religious persecution and widespread war. As a result, the wisdom of the CSCS has been carefully guarded and transmitted, ensuring a robust lineage of sacred knowledge.

### III. Symbolism

Central to the CSCS system are its unique CrossSigils, which serve as pictorial signatures symbolizing the forces and powers behind the practices. These symbolic configurations provide conduits for anchoring and channeling energies, enabling the practitioner to invoke and harness the powers of astral and spiritual realms.

The most prominent symbol within the CSCS is the Serpent, often depicted encircling the CrossSigil. Representing transformation, regeneration, and spiritual transcendence, the Serpent embodies an essential principle within the Companie's teachings. The Cross, in turn, symbolizes the meeting point between the horizontal plane of the mundane world and the vertical plane of spiritual existence, where the practitioner seeks to elevate consciousness and unlock latent powers.

Further symbolism can be found in the intricate geometries of the CrossSigils themselves, which encapsulate specific energetic patterns reflective of their intended use. By studying, meditating, and working with these symbols, the student develops the ability to discern and interact with the otherwise invisible forces that pervade the cosmos.

### IV. Practical Techniques

The development of practical techniques is vital for the student of the CSCS, who seeks to actively engage with the forces and powers made accessible through the CrossSigils. Following is a brief outline of the core techniques.

1. Meditation and Visualization: Key to establishing a connection with the energies of the CrossSigils is the practice of mindfulness and focused visualization. The practitioner internalizes the symbolic representations, creating a psychic link that facilitates the flow of energy and the invocation of specific powers.

2. Breathwork and Energy Manipulation: Mastery of one's vital force, or prana, serves to enhance the efficacy of the invocations. By regulating breath and consciously directing it through the energy centers within the body, the practitioner amplifies their ability to channel astral and spiritual energies.

3. Ritual and Ceremony: Ritual practice serves to create a sacred space, a nexus wherein the practitioner can safely engage with the forces and intelligences represented by the CrossSigils. Drawing upon the rich tradition of Western ceremonial magic, the CSCS practitioner incorporates tools, garments, and invocations to create a harmonious environment conducive to successful outcomes.

4. Ethical Deployment: The wisdom of the CSCS contains both benevolent and malevolent potential. It is incumbent upon the student to develop strict moral and ethical guidelines to ensure the responsible application of the powers made available through the CrossSigils. Achieving balance and practicing discernment are essential in cultivating a fruitful and beneficial relationship with the forces at work within the Companie's teachings.

### V. Conclusion

The Companie of the Serpent CrossSigils offers a rich and powerful path to spiritual transformation and occult mastery. Students who immerse themselves in its history, symbolism, and techniques will undoubtedly develop a lasting understanding of the hidden forces at work within the world, and the means to harness those forces responsibly. May the teachings of the CSCS illuminate your path and inspire your pursuit of wisdom.
