To fully understand the hidden atavistic connection between the animal kingdom, human consciousness, and astral dimensions, we must first delve into the background of these core concepts and explore how they connect to each other, before examining their transformative potential and application in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment.

The animal kingdom serves as a crucial component in our exploration for a few primary reasons. Firstly, it helps us recognize our rootedness in the natural world, and the shared evolutionary connection with all other living beings. Secondly, many ancient traditions and spiritual practices incorporate animal symbolism to convey deep wisdom and insights into human nature, virtues, and behavior -- this is seen in shamanic practices, totem animals, and ancient cultures, such as the Egyptians and Native Americans.

Human consciousness, on the other hand, refers to our self-awareness, cognition, and subjective experiences. The connection between human consciousness and the animal kingdom is exemplified by Carl Jung's concept of the "collective unconscious," which posits that there are archetypal symbols shared across cultures, derived from our shared evolutionary history. Thus, by connecting to these archetypes, we can retrieve hidden atavistic wisdom that can potentially transform our consciousness.

The astral dimensions, in contrast, refer to aspects of reality that is beyond the physical, material realm, often considered synonymous with the spiritual or metaphysical dimensions. These dimensions are characterized by their unique vibratory frequencies, non-temporal and non-spatial nature. Various spiritual practices, including meditation and astral projection, have been reported to enable individuals to access these astral dimensions.

Now, the hidden atavistic connection between these three elements potentially lies in the concept of "animal spirits" or "power animals." Through meditation or shamanic practices, an initiate could connect with their power animal(s) which represent innate, primordial forces hidden within their psyche. By forming conscious connections to and learning from these animal spirits, an individual can gain knowledge that transcends the physical and taps into higher astral dimensions.

By becoming aware of the characteristics and qualities associated with one's power animal(s), the initiate has the potential to assimilate these attributes—which are already inherent but may be dormant— into their consciousness as part of their personal evolution. This, in turn, can lead to insights, virtues, and transformative self-awareness that enhances spiritual growth.

To harmoniously unite these disparate elements in the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment, the initiate should consider adopting the following steps:

1. Engage in self-inquiry, meditation, or other contemplative practices that might facilitate the identification and connection with one's power animal(s).
 
2. Immerse themselves in the learning and understanding of different animal symbols, archetypes, and their meanings to increase their knowledge of how various animals symbolize aspects of human nature, virtues, and behaviors.

3. Practice developing qualities and virtues symbolized by their power animals and integrate the teachings and guidance received from these animal spirits into their daily life and spiritual journey.

4. Utilize the insights gained from connecting to power animals as a catalyst for spiritual growth and exploration, which can guide the initiate through higher astral dimensions, cultivating a heightened state of consciousness.

In conclusion, the transformative path of personal evolution requires a comprehensive understanding of the atavistic connection between the animal kingdom, human consciousness, and astral dimensions. By connecting with power animals and learning from the wisdom they hold, the initiate can harmoniously unite these seemingly disparate elements and embark on a journey of spiritual enlightenment. This path is one of deep self-awareness, integration of primordial wisdom, and spiritual evolution by combining the teachings of the physical and astral realms.
