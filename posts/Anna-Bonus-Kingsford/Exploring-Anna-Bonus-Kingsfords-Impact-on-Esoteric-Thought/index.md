As a writer, spiritualist, and visionary, Anna Bonus Kingsford used her unique perspective to explore the depths of the unknown, creating a lasting impact for practitioners of the occult and those devoted to the exploration of esoteric teachings.

One of Anna Kingsford's most significant works was "The Perfect Way; or, The Finding of Christ" (1882), co-authored with her close associate and student, Edward Maitland.

This emphasis on esoteric knowledge, in conjunction with her dedication to direct spiritual experience, allowed Kingsford's work to resonate with those seeking a more profound connection to the divine.
