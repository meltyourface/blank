Anna Bonus Kingsford (1846-1888) was a British spiritual visionary, mystic, and occultist who played a pivotal role in the development of modern Western esotericism.

Kingsford went on to study medicine at the University of Paris, becoming one of the first female physicians in the United Kingdom. This achievement was complemented by her remarkable ability to balance a career in both medicine and spiritual development.

Throughout her life, Kingsford was an ardent advocate for animal rights, suffrage, and vegetarianism, which showcased her commitment to social reform and the betterment of humanity.
