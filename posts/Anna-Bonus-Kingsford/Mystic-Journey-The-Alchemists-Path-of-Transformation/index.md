In secret chambers, where cosmic winds play,
A mystic tapestry weaved I found;
Clothed in the Sun, embroidered with the stars,
A sacred marriage danced upon its threads.

The alchemist's touch concealed within,
A quest for truth, a silent place where's known,
The hermetic creed - distilled to shimmering gold,
Emerald eyes of wisdom gaze below.

Rising phoenix, wings of flaming blaze,
Transmutations of eternal fire;
In ash and ember, lies a golden truth,
Unveiled the balance, sun and moon conjoined.

The serpent with the mirrored emerald tail,
A double helix of elusive power,
Within its grasp, the shadow of the cross,
Entwined the Tree of Life, its roots to sky.

Sophia whispers midst the thrashing waves,
A siren call from Ocean's ivory depth;
"Remember you, ye sacred sons and daughters,
Your hearts are molded in the ancient clay."

Upon this ancient clay, blessed sanctuary,
The shrine of sacred voices in the night,
The torch's flame ignites the passageway,
Unlocking gates of mysteries divine.

Unfurl the scrolls of whispering aeons,
The mystic dance, Her rhythm spiraled out;
Within the heart, the hidden chamber dwells,
The holy shrine, the mercurial truth awaits.

A rose of crimson hues, ten thousand petals,
Incomprehensible enchantresses of bloom,
Yet, in the center, a transient gleam,
The sun at dawn, to pierce the realms of gloom.

In Sacred Union joined, the ashen veil lifted,
Boundless pools of night, in their embrace,
A cosmic spiral birthed from sacred union,
Crafted by the fire-chariot's golden trace.

Emerge, beloved child of the Radiant,
Clothed with the Sun: transcend, become, and be;
Though mortal eyes do overlook Thy presence,
In realms unseen, Thy brilliant soul runs free.
