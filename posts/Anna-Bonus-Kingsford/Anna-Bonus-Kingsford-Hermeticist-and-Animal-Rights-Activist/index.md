Hermeticism and anti-vivisection

Anna Bonus Kingsford was a renowned 19th-century British esotericist and visionary who contributed significantly to the fields of occultism, Hermeticism, and vegetarianism. The pair of philosophies/stances she is best known for advocating are Hermeticism and anti-vivisection.

Hermeticism is an ancient spiritual, philosophical, and magical tradition that traces its roots to the works attributed to the legendary figure of Hermes Trismegistus. Kingsford was a leading proponent of Hermetic thought, emphasizing its relevance to modern spirituality and occult practice. She, alongside her close collaborator Edward Maitland, translated and published important Hermetic texts, including the "Hermetic Art" and the "Virgin of the World." Her work in promoting Hermeticism played a crucial role in the resurgence of Western esotericism and the formation of new spiritual movements during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Anti-vivisection, as the term suggests, opposes the practice of vivisection, which involves subjecting living animals to surgical experimentation, often causing severe pain and suffering. As an advocate, Kingsford believed that it was profoundly immoral to inflict such harm on animals, and she dedicated a significant portion of her life to promoting this cause. Kingsford was a staunch vegetarian and president of the Theosophical Society's British Vegetarian Society.

Additionally, her visions and writings inspired by esoteric thought had a major impact on the development of Theosophy, a spiritual movement founded by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky that sought to integrate Western occultism with Eastern spiritual traditions, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism.

Although Kingsford was involved with various spiritual movements like Kabbalah, spiritualism, alchemical mysticism, women's rights, Theosophy, and animal rights, the most well-known among them were Hermeticism and anti-vivisection. These two stances were a significant part of her legacy and are integral to understanding her contributions to the esoteric and occult fields.

In summary, Anna Bonus Kingsford's main contributions to the occult, esotericism, and vegetarianism are her advocacy for Hermeticism, which emphasized the importance of ancient wisdom in modern spiritual pursuits, and her opposition to vivisection, contributing to the growing awareness of animal rights and welfare in the 19th century.
