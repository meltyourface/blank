In this thesis, we will explore the intricate nature of mystical symbolism in Anna Bonus Kingsford's seminal work, "The Perfect Way or the Finding of Christ," by examining the significance of her innovative approach, which aptly amalgamates Christian, esoteric, and occult influences. This unique synthesis of traditions allows Kingsford to weave a rich tapestry of symbols and imagery that both challenge conventional religious thinking and offer profound spiritual insights into the human condition. By dissecting key passages from the text, such as the intertwining of the serpent and the cross, the concept of the Divine Feminine, and the reinterpretation of traditional Christian themes such as the Fall of Man and redemption, we aim to demonstrate how Kingsford's visionary work transcends conventional boundaries and invites readers to embark on a transformative spiritual journey marked by self-discovery and divine connection.
