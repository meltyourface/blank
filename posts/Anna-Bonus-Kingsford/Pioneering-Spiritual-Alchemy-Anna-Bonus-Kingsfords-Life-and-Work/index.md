The best answer is:
- Promoting spiritual alchemy and the idea of universal redemption as a result of her mystical experiences and collaboration with Edward Maitland in writing "The Perfect Way"

Anna Bonus Kingsford (1846-1888) was a trailblazer in many fields - spiritualism, mysticism, women's rights, and anti-vivisectionism. She was a prominent writer, educator, and advocate for progressive causes in the late 19th century. As the first female English physician, she championed the rights of women in education and medicine.

Kingsford joined The Theosophical Society in 1883 and co-founded the Hermetic Society in 1884 with her close collaborator Edward Maitland. She had mystical experiences and visions which shaped her literary works and philosophical approach.

Her most significant work, co-written with Maitland, was "The Perfect Way; or, The Finding of Christ" (1882), which expounded on the principles of spiritual alchemy and the idea of universal redemption. Through this book, she delved into the mysteries of human consciousness and spiritual development, presenting a holistic view of the cosmos and the role of humanity within it. This work promoted the idea that humans are divine beings capable of achieving spiritual enlightenment and realization of their inherent nature. She also emphasized the importance of intuition and inner guidance in the quest for spiritual truth.

Kingsford's advocacy against vivisection was commendable, but it is not the most comprehensive representation of her contributions to the occult, esoteric, and educational fields. Although she was indeed involved in women's rights and medicine, her influence extended beyond these domains and included significant esoteric teachings as well. Lastly, while Kingsford did translate and write about Christian mysticism, her contributions were much broader and encompassed her personal experiences, mystic visions, and spiritual philosophy, which contributed to the spiritual development of many individuals.

In conclusion, Anna Bonus Kingsford's most crucial contribution lay in her promotion of spiritual alchemy and the idea of universal redemption, which she presented through her mystical experiences and collaboration with Edward Maitland in writing "The Perfect Way." Her works and teachings have had a lasting impact on the understanding of spiritual growth, esoteric knowledge, and personal transformation.
