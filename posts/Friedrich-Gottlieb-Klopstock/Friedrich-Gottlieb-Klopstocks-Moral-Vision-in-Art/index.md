Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724-1803) was a German poet, a influential figure in the literary sphere, and an important contributor to the Sturm und Drang movement. His views on the role and purpose of art in society were heavily influenced by the Enlightenment, German Pietism, and his contemporaries, as well as a myriad of philosophical traditions.

Klopstock's perspective on the function of art and the artist in society is deeply embedded within the moral and ethical domains. He believed that the primary role of art is to elevate human consciousness and inspire moral and spiritual development. His own works, such as his most famous epic poem "The Messiah," exemplify this belief. "The Messiah" provides a vivid depiction of Christ's life, aimed at uplifting the reader's spiritual understanding and inspiring them to lead a virtuous life.

Klopstock's stance on the interplay between art and morality is intricately connected to his own spiritual and religious convictions. He was a devout Lutheran and imbued with Protestant Pietism, which emphasized the importance of a deep, personal relationship with God and an intense, emotional religious experience. His works often sought to illustrate moral principles that adhered to these tenets.

His views on the spiritual enrichment of humanity through art can also be observed in his poem cycle "Odes," which centers around themes of love, friendship, patriotism, nature, and devotion to the divine. Klopstock's poetry is characterized by a strong emphasis on emotions and spiritual ideals, which he used as a vehicle to convey his moral vision.

The influence of his contemporaries and predecessors can be identified in his appreciation for Greek classical poetry, admiration for John Milton's "Paradise Lost" and the works of Immanuel Kant, from whom he might have drawn inspiration to emphasize moral values in his artistic expression.

Klopstock also found inspiration in the works of his contemporaries, notably in the ideas of Friedrich Schiller, who believed in the transformative power of art to elevate humankind. Schiller's "Aesthetic Letters," published in 1795, asserts that the pursuit of truth and beauty through art can lead to the development of ethical and virtuous character traits.

The cultural and historical contexts that shaped Klopstock's ideas were marked by the Sturm und Drang movement, which advocated for the expression of strong emotions, individualism, and a focus on subjective experience. This is prominently reflected in Klopstock's poetic and philosophical approach. Moreover, Klopstock was deeply influenced by the ideals of the German Enlightenment, which praised reason and knowledge, and called for a new sense of individual and artistic freedom.

To summarize, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock's perspective on the role and purpose of art in society was shaped by a wide array of influences and contexts, which culminated in a unique moral vision for the artist and their creations. Relevant themes from his works include spiritual and moral elevation, love and devotion, and the synthesis of Enlightenment ideals within the Sturm und Drang movement. Thus, Klopstock's ideas on the interplay between art and morality remain a testament to his deep engagement with both the spiritual and intellectual aspects of his time.
