Amidst the astral planes, where mystic orbs align,
In shadows of creation, love's enigma doth shine.
From fiery chariots drawn by horses never tamed,
Two hearts adrift, by secret cosmic forces, claimed.

A nymph, entwined within Gaia's verdant lap,
A seraphim, ensnared by heaven's hallowed trap,
By Love's unyielding spell, their fates forever crossed,
A union forged in eldritch fire, no mortal cost.

Through twilight's veil, they dared to bridge the chasm wide,
Unbound by laws that lesser beings must abide.
Unfettered by the grasp of time's relentless hand,
They danced upon the cusp of realms, where shadows blend.

For in the depths of love, where sorcery takes flight,
Transcendence reigns; all barriers turn to naught.
