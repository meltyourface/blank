## The Ritual of Golden Prosperity

**Intention**: Attracting prosperity and financial abundance

Candle Color: Green

Essential Oils: Cinnamon, patchouli, and bergamot

Preparing the Candle:
1. Choose a high-quality green candle, preferably made of beeswax or soy, signifying growth and abundance.
2. Carve the following prosperity sigil at the top: `âˆž$`. The infinity symbol represents an endless flow of abundance, and the money symbol signifies the financial prosperity you desire.
3. Next, carve your full name on the candle, connecting your energy to the intention.
4. Anoint the candle with cinnamon, patchouli, and bergamot essential oils by using your fingertips to spread a small amount in a clockwise manner, further imprinting your intentions into the candle. As you do this, say the following: "Oil of abundance, attract wealth of every kind. Bring blessings and joy, connect to the prosperity I wish to find."

Lunar Phase and Astrological Alignments:
Perform the ritual during the first quarter or Full Moon phase, when the energies are at their peak for manifesting intentions. As for astrological alignments, look for a day when the Sun or Moon is in an Earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to enhance financial and material endeavors.

**Incantation**:
"By the Moon's glow and Earth's embrace,
I call upon the abundance to fill my space.
As I desire, so shall it be,
A plentiful harvest for all to see. 
Prosperity flows to me now,
With ease and grace, I do avow.
From east to west, and north to south,
Let golden opportunities fill my mouth.
As the candle burns, so grows my wealth,
In perfect alignment with my highest self."

Additional Offerings and Sacred Items:
1. Create a small altar around the candle with sacred items that symbolize prosperity and abundance, such as coins, crystals (citrine, pyrite, jade), and images of deities associated with wealth (Ganesha, Lakshmi, Fortuna).
2. Place fresh flowers, preferably yellow or golden, to represent the blossoming of prosperity.
3. Offer a small dish of honey to represent the sweetness of the financial blessings you wish to attract.

Performing The Ritual:
1. Cleanse your sacred space with sage or palo santo to clear any negative energy.
2. Create sacred boundaries by casting a circle with salt, calling upon protective energies.
3. Set up the altar with your sacred items and offerings, placing the prepared candle in the center.
4. Light the candle and recite the incantation three times.
5. Spend some time meditating on your intention, visualizing yourself in a state of abundance.
6. Thank the universe and deities for their support and assistance, saying, "For the highest good and without harm, so mote it be."
7. Leave the candle to burn safely until it extinguishes itself, releasing your intention entirely into the universe.

After performing the ritual, be open to opportunities and trust that the abundance you desire will manifest in your life.
