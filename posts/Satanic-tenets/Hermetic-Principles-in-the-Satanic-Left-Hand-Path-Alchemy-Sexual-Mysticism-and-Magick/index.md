Investigating and analyzing the intricacies of Hermetic principles within the context of the Satanic Left Hand Path requires a deep understanding of both the history and tenets of these two distinct but interconnected philosophical systems. Let us first delve into understanding the core principles of each system.

Hermeticism is an ancient spiritual and philosophical tradition rooted in the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, believed to be a synthesis of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek god Hermes. The Hermetic teachings revolve around seven primary principles: Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender.

On the other hand, the Satanic Left Hand Path is a branch of occultism that has evolved over the centuries as a reaction against conventional religious systems and societal norms, gaining prominence in the 20th century with the establishment of the Church of Satan by Anton LaVey. It emphasizes individuality, self-discovery, and the exploration of one's desires and inclinations, often utilizing transgressive and non-conformist methods.

Examining lesser-known teachings and rituals of Hermeticism within the context of the Satanic Left Hand Path, we may look at three specific areas:

1. Alchemy: Both Hermeticism and the Left Hand Path place a strong emphasis on personal transformation through ritual and practice. In Hermeticism, alchemy is the process of turning base metals into gold, symbolizing the refinement of the soul. In the context of the Left Hand Path, practitioners may use similar concepts of spiritual alchemy to achieve self-realization and individual empowerment.

2. Sexual Mysticism: In both traditions, sexuality is considered a powerful tool for reaching altered states of consciousness and connecting with the divine. Lesser-known rituals in the Left Hand Path incorporate Hermetic principles of polarity and gender, often borrowing from the symbolism of sacred texts such as the Emerald Tablet, in order to engage in transformative sexual experiences.

3. Magick and Invocation: Another lesser-known teaching in the confluence of Hermeticism and the Satanic Left Hand Path is the practice of invoking divine or demonic figures as a means to self-discovery and self-transformation. Through ritual and meditation, practitioners may call upon the energies of archetypal figures, such as the gods and goddesses of ancient polytheistic traditions, to realize their own potential and enhanced understanding.

Analyzing various real-life case studies, we find many examples illustrating the use of Hermetic principles in the Satanic Left Hand Path. One of the most notorious cases is the life of Aleister Crowley, an English occultist and ceremonial magician who sought to create a synthesis of previous esoteric teachings to develop a new system of spiritual practice, called Thelema. Crowley became an influential figure in the occult world and is revered by contemporary Satanists and Left Hand Path practitioners.

Regarding the application and evolution of Hermeticism in contemporary society, we can see elements of its teachings permeate various aspects of the Satanic Left Hand Path, including:

- The growing emphasis on individual spiritual exploration and personal empowerment.
- The incorporation of ancient symbolism and ritualistic practices in contemporary Left Hand Path ceremonies and magickal workings.
- The blending of traditional Hermetic ideas with new age philosophies, psychoanalysis, and other diverse fields of expertise.

In conclusion, the intricate connections between Hermetic principles and the Satanic Left Hand Path remain a fascinating subject for exploration. The two traditions have interwoven and influenced each other over time, resulting in unique practices and rituals that have enriched the spiritual landscape of modern-day Satanism and its surrounding subcultures.
