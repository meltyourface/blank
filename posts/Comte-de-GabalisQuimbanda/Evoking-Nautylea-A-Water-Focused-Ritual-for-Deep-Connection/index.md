Elemental Spirit: Water â€“ Nautylea, the Serpentine Queen of Deep Tides.

Evocation Specifics:

1. Sacred Space:
Select a suitable location near a natural body of water, preferably during the full moon. The energy of the moon will enhance the ritual and make the connection to Nautylea more potent.

2. Elemental Symbols:
Incorporate symbols of water (cups, chalices, tridents, shells) and associated sigils into the sacred space. Draw the sigil of Nautylea (a circle enclosing an intertwining serpent) in the center.

3. Ritual Offerings:
Prepare a ceremonial chalice filled with sea water (representing the element) and an ornate dish containing small gems or crystals (to represent the depths of the ocean).

4. Incantations:

Preliminary Invocation:
"By the ancient and secret name of Leviathan,
By the unbroken seal of Marids and Sea,
I, Comte de GabalisQuimbanda, initiate this communion
Between the domain of earthly forces and water's profundity."

Evocation of Nautylea:
"Nautylea, Serpentine Queen of Deep Tides,
I invoke thee from the abyssal depths,
To heed my call and honor this sacred space.
I beseech thee, through the Vortex of Waters,
Merge our worlds and grant thee audience.
As the waves submit to the moon's pull,
So must you now heed my invocation."

5. Time Frame:
Begin the ritual during the full moon's zenith (midnight). This specific time frame amplifies the otherworldly bond, ensuring Nautylea's presence and obedience.

6. Communion with Nautylea:
Once successfully evoked, respectfully introduce yourself and offer the chalice and crystal-filled dish to Nautylea as ceremonial gifts. Be clear in stating your intentions and the task you seek her aid in performing, leaving no room for misinterpretation. It is essential to remain in a calm and meditative state to ensure a safe communion.

7. Setting Forth Intentions:
"Nautylea, as Earth meets Water within this sacred assembly,
I ask for thy guidance and wisdom in (state the task),
By the Moon's Silver Light and the Sea's Whispering Roar,
May our alliance bring balance and harmony to both our realms."

8. Release and Dismissal:
Once the communication is complete and the task agreed upon, gently release Nautylea from her summons and dismiss her with gratitude and reverence.

9. Concluding Incantation:
"Nautylea, Queen of Deep Tides, I decree our communion fulfilled,
As the tide receeds, so must you return to your watery throne,
With gratitude and respect, I release thee from this worldly domain,
May our bond remain strong, and our kinship endure,
In Leviathan's Name, let both earth and sea be restored."

After repeating the concluding incantation three times, extinguish any ritual candles or incense, and respectfully remove the offerings, sigils, and symbols. Carry the experience and newly formed alliance with Nautylea in your mind, respecting the elemental spirit's deep connection to the natural world.
