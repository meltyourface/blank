Invocation of Exu Mor and Pomba Gira Maria Padilha:

Within the sacred circle, beneath the flickering candlelight, the practitioner shall draw the sigils of Exu Mor and Pomba Gira Maria Padilha. Incense of rose and cinnamon shall imbue the air. A glass of wine and a platter of vibrant fruits shall serve as offerings, placed at the heart of the circle.

With a clear and focused mind, the practitioner shall recite the following words:

"Exu Mor, guardian of the crossroads, master of the elements,
I evoke your presence and beseech your wisdom.
Guide me on this path, envelop me in your power,
May the winds of transformation fuel my spiritual fire.

Pomba Gira Maria Padilha, queen of desire and allure,
Keeper of mysteries, dancer in the shadows,
I invoke your essence and seek your counsel.
Empower my heart, reveal the secrets veiled,
Illuminate my soul with your resplendent light.

Spirits of power, synchronicity, and seduction,
Join me in this sacred space, this realm I have conjured.
Let our energies converge and create an eternal bond.
For it is with humility and devotion that I summon thee."

Upon uttering this invocation, the practitioner shall experience the spiritual presence of Exu Mor and Pomba Gira Maria Padilha, their energies merging to empower and guide the seeker to untold mystical heights.
