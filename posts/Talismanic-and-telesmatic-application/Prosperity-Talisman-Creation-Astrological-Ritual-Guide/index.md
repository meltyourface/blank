In response to the knowledge challenge presented, we shall design a ritual for the creation of a talisman with the aim of manifesting prosperity and abundance, incorporating astrological correspondences, elemental symbolism, and invocation of appropriate deities, while demonstrating the integration of telesmatic principles.

Before we delve into the details, let's lay some groundwork by understanding the key principles that need to be incorporated.

1. **Astrological Correspondences**: These relate to the alignment of celestial bodies like planets, zodiac signs, and lunar phases, which exert certain influences on rituals and outcomes.

2. **Elemental Symbolism**: The four classical elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water), each with its distinct properties and associations, used to imbue the talisman with specific energies.

3. **Invocation of Deities**: The act of calling upon deities, spirits, or higher powers for their aid and guidance in the ritual.

4. **Telesmatic Principles**: Derived from the Greek word 'telesma,' which means consecration or initiation, this principle involves the use of symbols, images, and names that resonate with the intended outcome, to provide a condensed, concentrated, and potent form of energy.

Now, let us begin designing the ritual:
**Step 1**: Preparation and Timing

Select a date and time when the astrological correspondences are favorable for manifesting prosperity. Typically, this involves a waxing or full moon phase and the alignment of Jupiter (the planet of abundance) or Venus (the planet of wealth and beauty), with a zodiac sign that supports prosperity, such as Taurus. Ensure that the time chosen has a strong elemental Earth presencesince it rules over material abundance, to strengthen the ritual.
**Step 2**: Setting the Space

Choose a quiet, clean, and sacred location for performing the ritual. Decorate the space with items that represent the element of Earth, such as soil, rocks, crystals, or green plants. Place a green or gold altar cloth, which resonates with abundance, on the surface where the talisman will be created.
**Step 3**: Gathering the Materials

Gather materials that embody the energies of prosperity and correspond with the desired outcome. Obtain a piece of solid metal or a crystal as the base for the talisman â€“ opt for materials that resonate with wealth, such as gold, copper, citrine, or pyrite. Collect symbols of abundance, like coins, dollar signs, or rune symbols like Fehu, which represents wealth. Prepare a small green candle and incense with scents like cinnamon or patchouli, to invoke Earth's element for prosperity.
**Step 4**: Cleansing and Preparation

Prior to the ritual, cleanse the talisman base and other involved tools using a suitable method, such as smoke cleansing with sage, rinsing in saltwater, or through exposure to moonlight. This process ensures the removal of residual energies and prepares the materials for consecration.
**Step 5**: The Ritual

Begin the ritual by lighting the candle and incense. Cast a circle around the space to create a protected boundary. Ground yourself and call upon the elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) and the cardinal directions (North, East, South, and West). 

Invoke the appropriate deity or deities associated with abundance, such as Lakshmi for Hindu tradition, Fortuna for Greco-Roman tradition, or Plutus for Greek mythology. Ask them to bless the talisman and for guidance in the process.

Invoke the elemental energies of Earth, as well as the specific astrological energies present during the ritual (such as Jupiter or Taurus). Meditate on your intention and visualize a flow of shimmering green or golden light flowing into the talisman base. Etch, draw, or attach symbols and telesmatic images with focused intention, to pre-determined points on the talisman base.

Once completed, channel a final charge of energy into the talisman by sealing it with appropriate incantation, mantra, or prayer. Thank the deities, elements, and directions for their help. Close the circle, blow out the candle, and let the incense burn out.
**Step 6**: Integration and Use

Keep the talisman on your person, in a dedicated sacred space, or place it somewhere prominent where it will consistently remind you of your intention. Regularly cleanse and recharge the talisman as needed.

In summary, we have designed a ritual for the creation of a prosperity talisman by incorporating astrological correspondences, elemental symbolism, invocation of appropriate deities, and telesmatic principles. **The ritual includes six elaborated steps**: preparation and timing, setting the space, gathering the materials, cleansing and preparation, the ritual itself, and integration and use. By adhering to these steps and integrating key themes, ideas, and energies, one can effectively manifest the desired outcome of prosperity and abundance.
