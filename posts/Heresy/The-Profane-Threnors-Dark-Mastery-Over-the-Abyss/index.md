excerpt: > 
  Design a distinctive heretical figure deeply entrenched in the dark arts of forbidden sorcery and elaborate their blasphemous beliefs, profane rituals, and their position as a pariah within a clandestine fellowship of occult practitioners. Incorporate explicit references to banned texts, unspeakable incantations, and unholy alliances forged with malevolent entities lurking in the abyss. Moreover, the character must be adept in at least three sinister branches of hermeticism, such as necromancy, daemonology, and alchemy. Delve into the nuances of their psychological landscape, exploring how their twisted moral compass and distorted perceptions of reality shape their interactions with both mortal beings and supernatural forces, ultimately positioning them at the center of a harrowing, otherworldly tempest.

Name: Threnor the Profane

Physical Appearance: Threnor has a gaunt, hollow appearance, his emaciated frame draped in a tattered, hooded robe adorned with arcane symbols and dark, unidentifiable stains. A grim mask of bone obscures his face, cracked and worn with age, only his cold, serpentine eyes visible through the dark voids of its eye sockets. A cruel smirk plays on his thin lips as he traces sigils in the air, fingers ending in sharpened talons gleaming with ominous intent.

Forbidden Practices:
1. Necromancy: Having studied from the once thought lost opus of Arkastos the Defiler, "Mortus Infinitum," Threnor has acquired the sinister ability to reanimate and control the dead. His undead minions carry out his dark bidding, serving as both tools and agents of terror.
2. Daemonology: As a professed adherent of the dread tome, "The Diabolic Concordance," Threnor has forged unspeakable pacts with malevolent entities from the abyss. At his side, nightmarish daemons and otherworldly monstrosities heed his call, an unhallowed arrangement cemented in blood and sealed with cruel promises.
3. Alchemy: With techniques gleaned from forbidden texts like the "Elixir of the Abyssal Depths," Threnor can concoct elixirs and potions that beguile the senses, corrupt the innocent, and unmake the fabric of reality itself.

Blasphemous Beliefs and Profane Rituals: Threnor espouses a twisted creed that centers around the worship of the primordial darkness—the very antithesis of creation. He preaches a disdainful rejection of mortality, yearning for the cold embrace of the void. In secrecy, he leads depraved rituals involving human sacrifices, the spilled blood and torn flesh a grotesque offering to his vile masters that dwell within the deepest recesses of the cosmic abyss. Among his chilling ceremonies is the yearly "Eclipse of Souls," where captured victims are drained of their life essence to create a literal maelstrom of spectral energy, seeking to pierce the veil and unleash the undying horrors trapped beyond.

Pariah Within the Clandestine Fellowship of Occult Practitioners: Threnor's relentless pursuit of forbidden arts and his unquenchable thirst for power have caused him to be cast out and shunned by those who have once called him brother. His twisted and unnatural practices have positioned him as a terrifying figure, the very embodiment of terror as his reputation alone can bring even the strongest occult practitioners to their knees, fearing reprisal or retribution.

Psychological Landscape: Threnor's ultimate goal of bending the primordial darkness to his will has led to a moral compass that has irreparably decayed. Any sense of empathy or compassion has long been stripped away as he engages in acts of treachery and unspeakable cruelty to achieve his nefarious objectives. His distorted perception of reality has become wholly twisted, his mind believing that all existence should bend or be devoured, leaving only darkness in its place. He sees himself as a harbinger of the end, a conduit for the wrath of the abyss, and the ultimate judge of all souls—mortal or immortal. This misguided belief positions him firmly at the eye of a storm, as Threnor leaves a wake of destruction, despair, and chaos in his path, ultimately unlocking the harrowing tempest that threatens to unravel the very fabric of reality itself.
