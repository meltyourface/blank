description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Heresy, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Craft an intricate series of verses utilizing diverse rhyming schemes, drawing inspiration from arcane signs and the cryptic lexicon of alchemy. Be sure to include references to at least three distinct heretical artifacts, occult phenomena, or esoteric rituals that will leave readers fascinated by the enigma enveloped within the poetic structure. As an additional challenge, evoke the spirit of a long-lost heretic figure using powerful imagery and carefully chosen adjectives that resonate with the dark arts and Heresy.

In twilight shadows, where sigils align,
A dactyl rises, with hexameters twined,
Sonnets of sulfur and salamander’s pyre,
Iambic pulse of the conjurer's choir.

Transmute the base in golden pursuit,
Cryptic lexicon, in lead roots enroute,
Ouroboros coils 'round philosopher's stone,
Seek now the knowledge of the nightshade's throne.

Grimoire unveils, breath of ancient chants,
Three artifacts of heretic's advance,
First, a dagger bathed in Babylon’s sin,
Call forth the spirit of long-lost kin.

Where demon tarot shrouds the seeker's truth,
A chalice profaned at Black Mass uncouth,
Witness moon's eclipse; the augury reborn,
In silence and shadows, occult wisps airborne.

Infernal maelstrom, summon dead whispers,
Enter the Aether, of mistress abyss,
Evoke the spirit of the heretic's plight,
Tenebrous coffer unleash the dark knight.

Dressed in robes tattered, his visage concealed,
Enshrouded in Heresy, darkness revealed,
Ars Goetia, the path he traversed,
Pandemonium's choir, his forbidden verse.

In twilight shadows, a forbidden tale,
Alchemy, Heresy, secrets unveiled,
Embrace the specter of occult artistry,
Dance with the shadows, in Heresy's sea.
