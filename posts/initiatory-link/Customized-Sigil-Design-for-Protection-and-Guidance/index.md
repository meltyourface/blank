As an AI text-based model, I am unable to provide a visual image of the sigil. However, I can create a detailed description of what the sigil should look like and how it's designed based on your requirements.

To begin with, we need to determine the numeric values of your birthdate, elemental alignment, and guardian animal spirit. For the sake of this response, let's assume the following:

**Birthdate**: DD/MM/YYYY
Elemental Alignment: Earth
Guardian Animal Spirit: Wolf

1. Birthdate numerology: Reduce your birthdate to a single number by adding the digits together. For example, if your birthdate is 17/08/1992, the sum of the digits would be 1+7+0+8+1+9+9+2 = 37. Then, reduce 37 to a single digit: 3 + 7 = 10, 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, your birthdate numerology is 1.

2. Elemental symbol: The symbol for Earth can be represented by the downward-pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it.

3. Warding off negative energies symbol: The Hamsa symbol, also known as the Hand of Fatima or the Hand of Miriam, is widely known to protect against negative energies.

Now, let's create a detailed description of the sigil:

Begin with a circle to represent the completeness and encompassing nature of the sigil. Inside the circle, delineate a stylized Hand of Hamsa symbol occupying the center, ensuring the eye within the hand is prominent as a representation of spiritual protection and warding off negative energies.

To incorporate your birthdate numerology, place the number 1 symbolically within the sigil. This can be done by using a single line or dot to represent the number 1, integrating it discreetly into the design of the Hamsa symbol.

In the background of the Hamsa symbol and overlaid by it, incorporate a faint imprint of the Earth element as a downward-pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it, signifying your elemental alignment.

Lastly, to include your guardian animal spirit, the Wolf, draw an elegant silhouetted wolf's head as if it was guarding the top of your Hamsa symbol, facing the eye, providing even more protection against malevolent forces.

By employing the elements mentioned, the sigil embodies the essence of protection, generates a powerful resonating energy complementing your initiatory link, and exhibits a visual representation of your guardian animal spirit to amplify the overall potency of your safeguarding emblem.
