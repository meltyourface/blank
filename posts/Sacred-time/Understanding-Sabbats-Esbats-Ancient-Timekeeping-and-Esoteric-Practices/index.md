To provide a comprehensive response to the knowledge challenge, we will begin by delving into the concepts of Sabbats and Esbats, their origins, and meanings within various esoteric and occult practices. We will then relate these observances to the cyclical nature of time, ancient calendrical systems, and initiation rites. Following this, we will examine the significance of these practices in an individual's path of self-discovery and their role in harmonizing one's life with divine universal forces.

Sabbats and Esbats are key observances in various pagan and esoteric traditions, most notably Wicca and modern witchcraft, as well as other Neopagan belief systems. Although the origins of these observances can be traced back to ancient pre-Christian European and Middle Eastern cultures, they have evolved and taken on new meanings as modern practitioners incorporate them into their spiritual practices.

The term "Sabbat" refers to seasonal celebrations that mark the turning points of the year, following the solar cycle and the changing of the seasons. **There are eight Sabbats in total, including the solstices, equinoxes, and cross-quarter days that sit between them. These Sabbats are**:
1. Yule (Winter Solstice)
2. Imbolc (Cross-quarter day, early February)
3. Ostara (Spring Equinox)
4. Beltane (Cross-quarter day, early May)
5. Litha (Summer Solstice)
6. Lughnasadh (Cross-quarter day, early August)
7. Mabon (Autumn Equinox)
8. Samhain (Cross-quarter day, end of October)

Each of these Sabbats corresponds to particular themes, such as renewal, transformation, abundance, and rest, depending on their place in the cycle and their historical and cultural contexts.

Esbats, on the other hand, are lunar celebrations observed monthly, following the phases of the moon. Esbats are often associated with either the full moon, the new moon, or both, and are rooted in the importance of the lunar cycle in women's fertility, agricultural cycles, and other natural phenomena.

Now, let's examine how these observances relate to the cyclical nature of time, ancient calendrical systems, and initiation rites. Throughout history, cultures around the world have developed sophisticated systems for marking the passage of time and understanding the cycles of the natural world. These calendars served various purposes, ranging from agricultural organization and productivity to providing frameworks for religious and ritual practices. Many of these calendars were based on lunar, solar, and seasonal cycles, and quite often, they would include feasts, festivals, and ceremonies that aligned with key points in these cycles.

In this context, it's clear that Sabbats and Esbats are rooted in ancient calendrical traditions, tying together solar, lunar, and seasonal cycles. This interconnectedness is a common theme in occult and esoteric practices. Moreover, initiation rites often utilize the symbolism and energies of Sabbats and Esbats as transformative tools for the individual's spiritual journey. For example, a neophyte could be initiated into a Wiccan coven on a particular Sabbat, symbolizing their transformation from one stage of spiritual development to another.

The spiritual correlates of Sabbats and Esbats manifest within an individual's path of self-discovery in several ways. Firstly, these observances provide a tangible connection to the cycles of nature, allowing practitioners to attune themselves to the ebb and flow of energy and experience the rhythms of the universe firsthand. By engaging with the symbolic and esoteric aspects of these celebrations, individuals can explore their own spiritual growth and development in conjunction with the changing cycles of the world around them.

Secondly, honoring Sabbats and Esbats can facilitate a deeper connection with spiritual guides, deities, or the divine forces that influence practitioners' lives and the cycle of nature. By acknowledging their presence and seeking their guidance during these observances, individuals can foster a more intimate relationship with the divine, enhancing their spiritual awareness and understanding.

In conclusion, the significance of Sabbats and Esbats in the sacred cosmic order lies in their deep connection to the cyclical nature of time and ancient calendrical systems. They are also intrinsically linked to initiation rites and esoteric symbolism, playing crucial roles in the spiritual development and transformation of individuals on their path of self-discovery. Through the observance of these celebrations, seekers of esoteric wisdom can perceive and harmonize their lives with the divine forces governing the universe, resulting in a deepened understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and more profound spiritual awareness.
