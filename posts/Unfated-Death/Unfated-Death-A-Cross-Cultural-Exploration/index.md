Unfated Death, the notion of an individual dying outside the predestined time or manner, has had deep and penetrating influences on belief systems across cultures throughout history. This exploration of Unfated Death will address the three specific dimensions requested:

1. The role of Unfated Death in mythology, folklore, and origin stories:

Unfated Death has played a significant role in shaping the mythology of various cultural contexts. For instance, in Ancient Greek myth, Atropos, one of the three Fates, was responsible for cutting the thread of life, symbolizing one's predestined death. However, certain stories involve individuals interacting with the Fates to alter or delay their destinies, introducing the possibility of an Unfated Death.

In Norse mythology, the Norns were similar to the Fates, weaving the destinies of gods and men. Stories of mortal heroes resisting their predetermined deaths or achieving an "undying" legacy can be seen as representations of Unfated Death.

Hindu mythology and belief contains the concept of Karma, which determines the circumstances of an individual's rebirth and, ultimately, their death. However, certain paths in Hinduism, like Moksha, allow individuals to transcend the cycle of birth and death, signifying a breaking free from predestined deaths.

2. The perception of Unfated Death in religious doctrines, ritual practices, and moral codes:

In Christianity, the idea of predestination is central to certain denominations. However, the belief in free will and the possibility of changing one's fate through repentance and faith in God's mercy can be seen as an expression of Unfated Death.

In Buddhism, the concept of Karma is also present, with the idea that beings' actions determine the nature of their future existence. However, achieving Nirvana, the ultimate release from the cycle of life and death, signifies the attainment of an Unfated Death.

Several tribal religions, such as those found in Africa, Oceania, or the Americas, have their belief systems rooted in the natural world. In these cultures, unexpected or "unnatural" deaths can manifest as Unfated Deaths. Such incidents often lead to the belief in malevolent forces at play, implicating the intervention of witches, trickster spirits, or ancestral displeasure.

3. The contribution of Unfated Death to esoteric and occult practices, secret societies, and death-related symbolism:

Unfated Death has contributed to the development of esoteric and occult practices, as human nature is often fascinated by the idea of circumventing natural order and predetermined fates. Practices such as necromancy, divination, or spells to extend one's life span can be seen as attempts to attain Unfated Death.

Secret societies like the Freemasons, tasked with guarding ancient wisdom, have been linked to ideas of achieving immortality or defying original fates. The philosopher's stone, a legend within alchemy said to grant eternal life, can be seen as another example of pursuing Unfated Death.

Death-related symbolism is rich in various spiritual traditions, such as the skull in European alchemy, the Mesoamerican depiction of the god of death, or the Tibetan Buddhist deity, Yama, as the lord of death. The recurrent theme of escaping or triumphing over death's inevitability indicates an underlying fascination with Unfated Death.

In conclusion, Unfated Death has shaped and influenced many aspects of mythology, folklore, religious doctrines, and even esoteric practices across cultures. It reflects the universal fascination with transcending the boundaries of mortality and stands as a testament to humanity's innate desire to escape or redefine the limits of fate.
