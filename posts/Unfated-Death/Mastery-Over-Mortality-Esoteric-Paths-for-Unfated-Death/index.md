The idea of Unfated Death in occult philosophy is inherently linked with aspects of immortality and transcendence above physical limitations. In some systems of belief, the practitioner's quest to overcome the predetermined mortal fate is seen as an expression of their willingness to harness the spiritual forces of the universe, resulting in effective shaping the uncharted territory of their own destiny.

Implications of Unfated Death on Destiny and Individual Choices
