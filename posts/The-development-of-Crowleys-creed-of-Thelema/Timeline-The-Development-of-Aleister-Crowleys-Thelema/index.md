The development of Crowley's creed of Thelema is a complex and multifaceted process, as it assimilates various influences from diverse sources, such as Rabelais, Egyptian deities, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Eastern traditions. To fully understand the depth and scope of Thelema's development, let's construct a comprehensive timeline with the most significant milestones that contributed to its establishment.

1. 1534-1564 – François Rabelais lays the groundwork: French author Rabelais, in his satirical works "Gargantua" and "Pantagruel," introduces the term "Thelema" and the associated Abbey of Thelema, embodying a utopian philosophy where people follow their "True Will" and live in accordance with their inherent nature.

2. Late 1800s – Revival of Egyptian-religious interest: Egypt experiences a cultural revival in Europe due to archaeological discoveries and increased access to ancient Egyptian texts. This sparks a resurgence of interest in Egyptian religion, which would later influence Crowley's views and the incorporation of Egyptian deities into Thelema.

3. 1888 – The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is founded: This influential, British-based secret society is established, incorporating teachings from various mystical traditions, including Hermeticism, Qabalah, and Rosicrucianism. The order serves as a training ground for several spiritual seekers, Aleister Crowley being one of them.

4. 1898 – Crowley joins the Golden Dawn: In November, Crowley joins the Golden Dawn under the magical motto "Perdurabo" (meaning "I will endure to the end"). He advances rapidly through the grades, learning their rituals and teachings, which will later influence his formation of Thelema.

5. 1900-1902 – Crowley travels to Asia: Driven by a thirst for knowledge, he journeys to India, Ceylon, and Burma, exploring Hinduism, Buddhism, and Yoga. These Eastern traditions will have a lasting impact on the formation of Thelema.

6. 1904 – The "Cairo Working": While in Cairo, Egypt, in April, Crowley claims to have received revelations from a supernatural entity named Aiwass, which supposedly dictate the foundational text of Thelema, "The Book of the Law." This text contains the core tenets of Thelema, including "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" and "Love is the law, love under will."

7. 1907 – Crowley founds the A∴A∴: Breaking ties with the Golden Dawn, he establishes his own secret society dedicated to the advancement of occult knowledge and the promulgation of Thelema, calling it the Argenteum Astrum, or A∴A∴.

8. 1909-1913 – The Equinox publication: Considered the official organ of the A∴A∴, The Equinox is published semi-annually, containing teachings, rituals, and an array of magical texts related to Thelema.

9. 1912 – O.T.O. initiation: Crowley joins the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), a German-originated order that merges elements of Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, and other mystical orders. The O.T.O. adopts Thelema as its central doctrine and undergoes significant changes under Crowley's influence.

10. 1920 – Establishment of the Abbey of Thelema: Following what he believes to be his True Will, Crowley purchases a villa in Cefalù, Italy, to establish the Abbey of Thelema, a spiritual commune dedicated to living in accordance with Thelemic principles.

In conclusion, the development of Crowley's creed of Thelema is a convergence of numerous influences, the most significant milestones being Rabelais' initial concept of Thelema, the incorporation of Egyptian deities and mythology, the connections to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Crowley's own experiences with Eastern religious and mystical traditions. The journey of Thelema's establishment is complex and revealing, shedding light on the intricate tapestry of ideas, beliefs, and practices that collectively form this unique spiritual and philosophical framework.
