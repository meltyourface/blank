As an AI language model, I am unable to create visual illustrations. However, I can provide you with a detailed textual description of the illustration that you can use as a basis for creating the visual representation yourself or with the help of a professional artist.

In the illustration, the central theme would be a large Tree of Life, a symbol that is well-known in many mystical and esoteric traditions, including alchemy and Kabbalah. This tree would symbolize the cosmic unity and interconnectedness of all elements, principles, and stages of personal development in metaphysical psychology.

The branches of the tree would be adorned with various alchemical symbols representing different aspects of the human psyche and the spiritual transformation process. To clearly demonstrate the intricate connections between these symbols and their corresponding metaphysical principles, the branches would be organized into three main tiers:

1. The upper tier would display symbols related to spiritual development. These would include:
   - The Ouroboros: Symbolizing cycles of creation, destruction, and renewal, the Ouroboros would encircle the entire tree, connecting all elements of the illustration and highlighting the perpetual nature of personal transformation.
   - The Caduceus: With its entwined serpents, the Caduceus would signify the harmonious balance between opposites, such as the conscious and unconscious mind.

2. The middle tier would focus on the four elements and their properties, demonstrating how they contribute to the overall transformation process within metaphysical psychology:
   - Earth: Represented by a downward-pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it, Earth is the element of stability and practicality. On the tree, it would signify the foundation upon which all psychological development is built.
   - Water: Depicted as an upward-pointing triangle, Water is the element of emotion and intuition. It would symbolize the importance of balancing rational thought with emotional intelligence in personal growth.
   - Air: As an upward-pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it, Air represents intellect and communication. It would accentuate the importance of clear communication and intellectual growth in metaphysical psychology.
   - Fire: As a downward-pointing triangle, Fire symbolizes transformative energy, passion, and creative power. It would emphasize the need for motivation and risk-taking in psychological transformation.

3. The lower tier would feature symbols that embody the stages of psychological transformation as they relate to alchemy:
   - Nigredo: Represented by a black crow, nigredo symbolizes the initial stage of transformation, where the individual confronts and integrates their shadow self into their psyche.
   - Albedo: Depicted as a white swan, albedo signifies the phase of spiritual purification and the growth of self-awareness.
   - Rubedo: Illustrated by a red phoenix, rubedo represents the achievement of psychological wholeness and the attainment of self-mastery.

Lastly, the roots of the tree would delve into the historical context and evolution of alchemical symbols and metaphysical psychology. Key historical figures, such as Carl Jung, Hermes Trismegistus, and Paracelsus, would be shown interacting with the roots, demonstrating their contributions to the growth of the field.

With this detailed description in mind, you could work with a professional artist to create a comprehensive illustration that clearly displays the intricate connections between alchemical symbols, metaphysical principles, and psychological transformation within the framework of metaphysical psychology.
