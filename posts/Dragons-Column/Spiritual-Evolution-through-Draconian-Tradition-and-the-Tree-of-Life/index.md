In order to delve into a comprehensive response to this knowledge challenge, it is first necessary to elucidate the fundamental concepts and frameworks involved. Let's begin by discussing Dragon's Column, the Tree of Life, the ten Sephiroth, the concept of the Ouroboros, and Draconian Tradition.

Dragon's Column refers to an esoteric tradition that, at its core, aims to achieve spiritual and magical evolution through the guidance and power of primordial forces and energies embodied in the form of dragons. These entities symbolize wisdom, transformation, and self-nurturing properties, which are essential to the practitioner's journey.

The Tree of Life is a primary concept in Kabbalah, a mystical belief system originating from Judaism. This symbolic diagram consists of ten interconnected spheres called the Sephiroth, which represent the steps in which God's creative power descends and eventually returns to its source. Each Sephirah corresponds to a particular aspect of divine energy, allowing practitioners to access and dialogue with these forces.

The Ouroboros, a mythological serpent or dragon that consumes its tail to form a circle, is an ancient symbol of cyclicality, regeneration, and the eternal nature of time and existence. In the Draconian Tradition, the Ouroboros represents the continuous process of self-discovery and evolution.

With these concepts outlined, we can proceed to synchronize the ten Sephiroth with the conception of the Ouroboros and Draconian Tradition, thereby interpreting and describing the initiate's transformational journey through these realms to attain the ultimate transmutation.

1. Kether: The Crown
The adventure of spiritual awakening begins with the first Sephirah, Kether, which embodies God's purest will to create and communicate with the material world. The initiate acknowledges their divine spark and embarks on their own Ouroboric journey of self-discovery and transformation.

2. Chokhmah: Wisdom
As the initiate moves to Chokhmah, they begin to explore the eternal cosmic mysteries and attain knowledge through direct contact with the divine. This newfound wisdom aligns with the Draconian Tradition's objective of uncovering hidden truths and understanding one's purpose in the cosmos.

3. Binah: Understanding
The pursuit of wisdom leads the practitioner to Binah, the sphere of understanding and introspection. Here, the initiate compares their acquired knowledge to their subjective experiences, thus forging their unique path within the Draconian tradition.

4. Chesed: Mercy
Ascending through the Sephiroth, the initiate reaches Chesed, the realm of mercy and divine love. This sphere accentuates compassion and forgiveness as vital components of the transformational journey. Understanding inner limitations uplifts the individual in their quest for holistic growth.

5. Gevurah: Severity
Juxtaposing the divine love of Chesed, Gevurah encompasses the concepts of judgment, discipline, and severity. In this realm, the practitioner must confront their ego and shadow aspects to complete the Ouroboric cycle of self-discovery and growth.

6. Tiphereth: Beauty
Tiphereth, the heart of the Tree of Life, signifies balanced energy and serves as a center of synthesis. Here, the imperfect human ego harmonizes with the higher divine self, marking a turning point in the initiate's journey towards holistic self-discovery and transformation.

7. Netzach: Victory
Emerging from Tiphereth, the practitioner reaches Netzach, a realm associated with victory, endurance, and lasting achievements. This challenges the initiate to persevere and maintain their spiritual practices and connections to dragons and divine energies amidst life's trials and tribulations.

8. Hod: Splendor
In the sphere of Hod, the spiritual aspirant cultivates logic, communication, and intellect while integrating the insights gained during their journey. Hod complements Netzach's emotionality with structure and discipline, reinforcing the significance of balance within the Draconian Tradition.

9. Yesod: Foundation
As the penultimate sphere, Yesod signifies the foundation of all previous experiences and transformative processes. The initiate anchors themselves in their individual spiritual practices, refining their connection with the intrinsic energies of the draconic realm.

10. Malkuth: The Kingdom
Finally, the initiate arrives at Malkuth, the last Sephirah on the Tree of Life. Representing the integration of spiritual, emotional, and mental realms, they attain comprehensive knowledge and a profound connection to the divine. This marks the completion of the Ouroboric cycle, where the aspirant now serves as a bridge between the divine and the mundane.

In summary, the process of synchronizing the ten Sephiroth with the conception of the Ouroboros and Draconian Tradition highlights a complex and transformative journey for spiritual aspirants. Through the guidance of the Tree of Life, initiates traverse the Sephiroth's mystical realms while incorporating draconic wisdom and energies. This cyclical adventure culminates in the ultimate transmutation, signifying their newfound mastery over self-discovery and evolution.
