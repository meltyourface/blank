  From the depths of ancient wisdom and the Dragon's Column divine,
  I call upon the Archetypal Draconic Energies, together, thee I bind.
  By the sacred symbols and the elements four,
  Rojhelian, Kivondrian, Uqkolar, and Traxtillion, I implore.
  
  In fire's embrace, Rojhelian's will be done,
  Ablaze with passion, exalted strength of the sun.
  Rise from the embers, oh empowering flame,
  Ignite the spirit, let ambition claim.
  
  Kivondrian, the watery depths, I now invoke,
  Majestic tides, the calm serenity you evoke.
  Dive through the mysteries, recondite realms of blue,
  As intuition blossoms, let ancient wisdom bloom anew.
  
  On the winds of change, Uqkolar's whispers soar,
  As airy lightness bears us through the etheric core.
  Oh, mighty gusts of inspiration and profound truth,
  Engulf the mind, embody clarity and renewed youth.
  
  Traxtillion, Earth's foundation, the ground underneath,
  Bring fortitude and protection, in your resilient embrace we bequeath.
  Oh, bastion of stability, unwavering and sublime,
  Through your connection, we unite the sands of time.
  
  By the Dragon's Column, the ancient art of yore,
  I summon the elements, their guidance I implore.
  Power of the dragon, entwined in unity,
  Bestow your blessings, strength, and wisdom upon me.
  
  Titans of the elements, by my exultation,
  Join my spirit, in this rhythmic incantation.
  With reverence, I call on thee, these words spoken in devotion,
  Eternal energies, elemental union, the cosmos now set in motion.
