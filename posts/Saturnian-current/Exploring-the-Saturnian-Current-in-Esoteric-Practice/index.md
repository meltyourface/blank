## The Saturnian Current - History, Symbolism, and Practice

I.A. History and Background of the Saturnian Current

The Saturnian current has its roots in ancient mythologies, dating back to the Sumerian god Enlil, and the planetary associations crafted during the time of Babylonian astrology. In the Roman pantheon, Saturn was the god of agriculture and bountiful harvests, as well as time and karmic cycles. Over time, the Saturnian current evolved into an esoteric and occult concept that has continued to captivate and challenge practitioners of the Western Mystery Tradition.

Saturnian energy is often depicted as cold, stern, and slow-moving. It represents lessons learned through restriction, discipline, and sacrifices required for spiritual growth and self-mastery. Associated with the planet Saturn and its astrological symbol â™„, the Saturnian current is one of the key energies that can be harnessed and channeled to power magical workings and influence personal and spiritual development.

Throughout the ages, the Saturnian current has become synonymous with initiation, spiritual wisdom, and alchemical transformation. Its symbolism includes the following:

2. The Black Cube: A symbol of form, structure, stability, and limitation. The black cube embodies the restrictions of the physical world and the transformational ascension that can be achieved through discipline and personal mastery.

3. The Scythe: A tool of harvesting, it represents cutting away what is unnecessary or outgrown, highlighting the transformative aspect of Saturn's energy.
