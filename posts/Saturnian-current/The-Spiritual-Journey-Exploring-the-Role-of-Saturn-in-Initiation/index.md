The Saturnian current, within the context of initiation, spiritual growth, and self-mastery, holds a crucial place. To fully understand its significance, we must delve into the depths of its associations with limitation, structure, and time and then explore the roles of the seven traditional planets in the western esoteric tradition, emphasizing the unique position that Saturn holds in this scheme.

To begin with, the Saturnian current represents the forces of limitation, structure, and time. These forces may appear restrictive, but they are actually crucial to the process of spiritual advancement. Limitation, for instance, serves to define our personal boundaries and capabilities. By recognizing and understanding our limitations, we can strive to overcome them and thereby grow spiritually. 

Structure, on the other hand, imparts order and organization to our spiritual journey. Through the imposition of structure, we develop discipline, which is essential for profound transformation. The strict and methodical nature of initiation is an excellent exemplification of this idea of structure. Initiates are guided through a progression of stages, with each unlocked by the mastery of prior lessons, skills, or experiences. Such a framework ensures that the knowledge acquired is comprehensive and well-integrated, culminating in the holistic development of spiritual adepts.

Lastly, time is a pivotal aspect of the Saturnian current. It symbolizes the cycles of life, death, and rebirth that mark our physical and spiritual journey. With each cycle comes new beginnings, allowing for the accumulation of wisdom and eventual spiritual liberation. Time also represents patience, persistence, and endurance, which are indispensable virtues for those pursuing the path of initiation.

Moving on, the role of the seven traditional planets in western esoteric tradition serves as a multifaceted system of correspondences and symbolic meanings. Each planet is associated with specific attributes that contribute to our understanding of cosmic forces and their effects on human consciousness. These are:

1. The Sun: Symbolizing life force, vitality, creativity, and the attainment of higher consciousness.
2. The Moon: Representing intuition, imagination, cycles, emotions, and the subconscious mind.
3. Mercury: Corresponding to communication, intellect, learning, and all forms of exchange, both tangible and intangible.
4. Venus: Denoting love, pleasure, beauty, harmony, and art.
5. Mars: Indicative of assertiveness, action, courage, and the raw energy needed to overcome obstacles.
6. Jupiter: Signifying expansion, growth, abundance, and the broadening of horizons.
7. Saturn: As previously mentioned, associated with limitation, structure, and time.

In this schema, Saturn assumes a unique and essential position. It stands as the final and most distant of the visible planets, serving as a marker for the boundary between the material and the spiritual realms. Saturn's position as a gateway to deeper esoteric mysteries means that it holds the keys to self-mastery and spiritual growth. By embracing the Saturnian current and its principles, initiates develop the fortitude and discipline necessary to surmount the trials of initiation, thereby attaining a higher state of spiritual maturity.

In conclusion, the significance of the Saturnian current's association with limitation, structure, and time lies in its critical function in facilitating spiritual growth and self-mastery. The seven traditional planets within the western esoteric tradition illustrate the diverse attributes and forces that govern human consciousness. Amongst them, Saturn is of particular importance due to its role as a gateway to esoteric wisdom and the impetus it provides for transformation. By acknowledging, understanding, and embracing the Saturnian current, spiritual aspirants are better equipped to navigate the path of initiation and realize their true potential.
