## The Coptic Calendar: Origins, Structure, and Occult Significance

### I. Introduction

The Coptic calendar, also known as the Alexandrian or Egyptian Christian calendar, is an ancient system of timekeeping that is still in use within the Coptic Orthodox Church and by the Egyptian farmers for agricultural purposes. In this section, we will delve into the origins, structure, correlation with other calendars, and the significance of the Coptic calendar in the study of the occult and esoteric practices.

### II. Origins

The Coptic calendar is derived from the ancient Egyptian civil calendar, which dates back to the third millennium BCE. The Egyptian calendar was based on the heliacal rising of the star Sirius, which closely aligns with the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile River. Over time, the civil calendar evolved, incorporating elements of the Julian calendar introduced during the Roman rule of Egypt. In the third century CE, the calendar was adopted by Egyptian Christians, who introduced the Coptic era (Anno Martyrum), starting from the year 284 CE, when Emperor Diocletian began his reign and the Diocletian Persecution of Christians took place.

### III. Structure

The Coptic calendar consists of 13 months: 12 months of 30 days each and an additional intercalary month, called the "thirteenth month" or the "month of the little days," comprising five or six days, depending on whether it is a leap year. **The names of the Coptic months are derived from Egyptian deities and festivals**:

1. Thout – September 11th to October 10th
2. Paopi – October 11th to November 9th
3. Hathor – November 10th to December 9th
4. Koiak – December 10th to January 8th
5. Tobi – January 9th to February 7th
6. Meshir – February 8th to March 9th
7. Paremhotep – March 10th to April 8th
8. Parmouti – April 9th to May 8th
9. Pashons – May 9th to June 7th
10. Paoni – June 8th to July 7th
11. Epep – July 8th to August 6th
12. Mesori – August 7th to September 5th
13. Pi Kogi Enavot (intercalary month) – September 6th to September 10th or 11th (leap year)

Each Coptic month is divided into three 10-day weeks, called "decans" after the Egyptian system of stellar divisions. The Coptic year begins in the month of Thout, which falls on September 11th in the Gregorian calendar or September 12th in the case of a Gregorian leap year.

### IV. Correlation with Other Calendars

The Coptic and Gregorian calendars are related in that both are based on the solar year. However, their methods of leap-year insertion diverge. In the Gregorian calendar, leap years occur every four years when the year is divisible by four, with the exception of years divisible by 100 but not by 400. In the Coptic calendar, a leap year occurs when the year is divisible by four, following the Julian leap-year rule without exception.

Due to these differences in leap-year calculations, the Coptic calendar currently falls behind the Gregorian calendar by 13 days (e.g., Thout 1 coincides with September 11th in the Gregorian calendar).

### V. Occult Significance and Application

The Coptic calendar, with its roots in ancient Egyptian traditions, carries with it notable contributions to the occult realm. Its specific influence on the modern esoteric practice can be traced through the interrelation of Egyptian, Greek, and Hellenistic religious traditions, which were assimilated into the teachings of Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and later Western ceremonial magic.

The Coptic calendar's division into decans, originally related to the visible stars and constellations in the night sky, carries a cosmological underpinning, tying the calendar to celestial events. Occult practitioners may use the Coptic calendar to track and plan rituals and ceremonies that align with significant cosmic occurrences such as solstices and equinoxes.

Furthermore, the Coptic calendar preserves the memory of ancient Egyptian deities and festivals, which may still hold significance in certain magical or spiritual practices. Drawing from this knowledge, esoteric scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the correspondences between the calendar, divinities, and rituals, and integrate this information into their practices.

### VI. Conclusion

In our exploration of the Coptic calendar, we have uncovered its origins and structure and delved into its correlations with other timekeeping systems and its significance within the realm of the occult. Students of the esoteric can benefit from understanding the Coptic calendar and its underlying principles, incorporating this ancient system of timekeeping into their spiritual and magical practices while gaining deeper insights into the connection between humanity, time, and the cosmos.
