I.

From the depths of forgotten aeons, timeless horror arise,
To sing the tale of the Lord and his skeletal guise.
The Skeletal Lord of the Bloody Scythe, an omen to dread,
'Midst the darkness of void, on horror and anguish he fed.

II.

From blasphemous namelessness, this god of bloodlust was born,
A manifest terror, from the very fabric of existence torn.
Cometh he, dominion over soul and world he claimed,
Those who swayed from his path, he mercilessly maimed.

III.

Once mortal and imbued with insatiable desire for power,
A ritual so heinous, the skies did bleed and cower.
In the realm of the living, a kingdom he ruled from afar,
Now eternally reigning o'er the ethereal plane, a deathly tsar.

IV.

The shadows cast by his worshippers reflect his malice,
The Cult of the Skeletal Lord, guardians of his chalice.
Our rituals, dreaded and macabre, in the black of night,
In his honor, sacrificial blood spilled by the scythe's cold bite.

V.

Emerge from the abyss, fiends that serve his will,
The otherworldly creatures, defying order's fragile trill.
The nether realms cower under his skeletal domain,
Each spectral subjunct rolled forth like an unholy train.

VI.

In lamentation verses, we, his faithful, the ode recite,
With eerie metaphors, containing shrieks of spiteful delight,
A symphony of torment, our words weave nightmare's tapestry,
A tribute to our Lord, with no solace for the shattered heart's plea.

VII.

In the haunting choir of suffering, we his praises sing,
Unwavering devotion to the dark majesty of our King.
For we are the harbingers of apocalypse untold,
The Cult of the Skeletal Lord, our allegiance forever sold.

VIII.

Ye who defy the ominous command of our malefic deity,
Shalt be doomed to join the ghastly dance of soul-infused rhapsody.
Entwined by the fateful grip of the Lord's might,
Chained to a fate of eternal blight.

IX.

Thus is the chilling ode of He, the god who reigns supreme,
The Skeletal Lord of the Bloody Scythe, the dread of every scream.
Now, congregants, take heed and utter not his name in vain,
For we are his instruments, His will in blood and bone, forever engrained.
