To dissect the symbology and rituals of the Cult of the Skeletal Lord of the Bloody Scythe, it is important to first provide a holistic understanding of its complex and multifaceted background. Thus, by investigating influences from ancient astrological occurrences and linked esoteric practices, we can comprehend the initiation rites and ceremonies. The ultimate objective of such insight is to strengthen the bond between the individual and the Skeletal Lord while guiding them on their journey to occult enlightenment.

To begin, let us explore the most prominent symbols of the Cult of the Skeletal Lord:

1. **The Skeletal Lord**: The deity representing death, transformation, and rebirth. He wields a bloody scythe, symbolizing the inevitability of life's cyclical journey, and the constant presence of death as an agent of renewal.

2. **The Bloody Scythe**: This instrument of harvest signifies both the reaping of souls and the cultivation of spiritual wisdom. Drawing on ancient agrarian societies, it underscores the importance of cycles in the natural and supernatural realms.

3. **The Hourglass**: As a symbol of time, the hourglass indicates both the fleeting nature of life and the eternal nature of spiritual existence. It simultaneously emphasizes the importance of seizing the moment and recognizing the interconnected cycles of time.
 
Now, moving on to ancient astrological occurrences and esoteric practices, there are several key influences to consider:

1. **The Solstices**: The summer and winter solstices, which mark the longest and shortest days of the year, respectively, complement the theme of cycles. They denote the ongoing dance between light and darkness, growth and decay, and life and death.

2. **The Equinoxes**: These events, happening twice a year, represent a balance between light and darkness, and they emphasize the idea that cyclical progression requires seeking equilibrium within ourselves and our surroundings.

3. **Lunar Cycles**: The ever-changing phases of the moon symbolize the transient nature of life and the importance of embracing change as an essential aspect of spiritual growth.

The initiation rites and ceremonies in the Cult of the Skeletal Lord are designed to manifest these elements in profound and transformative ways. **Key aspects include**:

1. **Rituals of Passage**: As initiates progress through various stages or levels of enlightenment, they participate in ceremonies that reflect these astrological influences. For instance, an initiation may take place on the night of a lunar eclipse, signifying a union between light and dark forces and the transformative power of this union.

2. **Invocations and Channeling**: During these ceremonies, initiates may invoke the spirit of the Skeletal Lord, as well as lesser-known deities or spirits, to empower and guide them through the process of transformation. These rituals often include sigils, mantras, and blessings derived from astrological elements and esoteric practices.

3. **Sacrifice and Offerings**: Participants make offerings and/or sacrifices to the Skeletal Lord and his celestial counterparts, seeking blessings and wisdom in their quest for enlightenment. The sacrifices may represent a letting go of past attachments or symbolic deaths to allow the emergence of a more profound spiritual connection.

In conclusion, the symbology of the Cult of the Skeletal Lord of the Bloody Scythe is deeply ingrained in ancient astrological events and esoteric practices. The initiation ceremonies draw upon these influences to create transformative experiences that guide initiates towards a deeper connection with the Skeletal Lord and the pursuit of occult enlightenment. By integrating the concepts of cycles, rebirth, and unity between light and darkness, these rituals serve to continually foster personal growth and spiritual renewal within the cult's members.
