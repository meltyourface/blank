O Thou celestial guide, my Guardian angel dear,
Whose watchful gaze doth rest upon my humble sphere,
Whom the Divine Creator hath charged to guard and lead,
This mortal soul through life's uncertain ebb and tide.

Upon the cosmic altar, I lay this prayer of invocation,
To thee, O my Guardian, the director of my fate, the bearer of light.
In the intricate maze of life, 'tis thou who wields the compass,
O great Seraphim, whose symbolic wings like a double-edged sword,
Cut through darkness, seeking to guide me 'long the golden path of righteousness.

Under the luminescent glow of the mighty Archangel, Raphael,
He who heals and restores, upon whose scales our souls are weighed,
I beseech thee, my gracious Guardian, to kindle within my heart
The radiant light of knowledge, to dispel the shadows of confusion.

O, sacred messenger of divine inspiration and wisdom, I invoke thee!
For the aeonian light of understanding dost thou possess,
Shed upon my path the incandescent rays of celestial clairvoyance,
That I may decipher and disentangle the knots of my current plight.

Through the subtle currents of ether, I attune my inner ear,
To the celestial symphony of your angelic utterances, bearing
The melodies of guidance, infused with the profound harmonies of divine wisdom.
Let the shimmering starlight of thy presence mold my soul,
Closing the chasm separating me from your heavenly realm.

With profound gratitude, I devote this invocation of guidance
To thee, my luminous Guardian, my unwavering celestial advocate.
My heart overflows with gratitude for thy countless benedictions,
Thy tireless presence by my side, and thy sacred gaze upon my humble life.

And so, O shining beacon, I dedicate my soul, even the essence of my being,
To nourish this divine link, our sacred bond everlasting.
May our union burn with fervor, a radiant sun amid the firmament,
Illuminating the path towards spiritual attainment and celestial harmony.

Amen.
