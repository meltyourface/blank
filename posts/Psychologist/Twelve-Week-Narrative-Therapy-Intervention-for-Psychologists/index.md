  Design a narrative therapy intervention specifically tailored for a Psychologist, aimed at assisting a client in deconstructing and reconstructing their life story through the examination of their unique psychosocial perspectives. Incorporate various techniques, such as externalizing conversations, unique outcome identification, and letter-writing activities. The intervention should include a precise 12-week session plan, complete with example case scenarios, weekly objectives, and strategies to facilitate the development of alternative, empowering narratives for the client.
