Passage chosen: Liber AL vel Legis, Book I, Chapter I, Verses 1-3:

1. Had! The manifestation of Nuit.
2. The unveiling of the company of heaven.
3. Every man and every woman is a star.

Annotation and Interpretation:

These three verses from Liber AL vel Legis lay the foundation for the Thelemic belief system, identifying the essential principles that inform Thelema's understanding of divinity, existence, and spiritual evolution. By examining this passage through the lens of Liber vel Ararita and its exploration of the manifestation of the divine, we can uncover an even deeper understanding of its esoteric significance. 

1. Had! The manifestation of Nuit.

In Liber vel Ararita, Had is identified as the ultimate point, the culmination of the divine force. Nuit, on the other hand, represents the infinite space that surrounds, contains, and accompanies the point. In the Thelemic system, Nuit is the goddess of the night sky, the personification of boundless potential and possibility. This verse emphasizes the manifestation of Nuit as the unifying principle that permeates the cosmos, acting as the womb out of which everything is born.

2. The unveiling of the company of heaven.

This verse is an invocation of the entities that reside in the heavenly realm. The company of heaven here operates as a metaphor for the constellation of forces, entities, and principles that govern our existence. Within the context of Liber vel Ararita, this unveiling highlights the process of spiritual evolution, in which the aspirant seeks to understand and work with these divine forces. The unveiling suggests a revelation, an initiation into the mysteries of existence, and the beginning of a transformative journey.

3. Every man and every woman is a star.

This verse establishes the fundamental axiom of Thelema that each individual carries divine essence and has a unique role in the universe. Drawing upon the symbolism of Liber vel Ararita, we can see that each person is a point of Had, a manifestation of Nuit, and thus a vital part of the divine tapestry. As stars, we are each a microcosm of the divine macrocosm, called to realize and manifest our innate potential, thereby participating in the ongoing evolution and dance of the cosmos.

In conclusion, the passage from Liber AL vel Legis exemplifies the interconnectedness of existence and the role that every individual plays in the larger cosmic scheme. By examining this passage in conjunction with Liber vel Ararita, we gain a more profound understanding of the manifestation of the divine and the process of spiritual evolution within the Thelemic tradition. Both texts emphasize the importance of self-discovery, the realization of one's inner divinity, and the continuous journey toward self-mastery and spiritual growth.
