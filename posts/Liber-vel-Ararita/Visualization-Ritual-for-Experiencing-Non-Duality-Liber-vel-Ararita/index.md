Visualization Ritual for Understanding Non-Duality through Liber vel Ararita

1. Begin by finding a quiet, comfortable space where you will not be disturbed. Sit or lie down in a position that allows for deep relaxation. Close your eyes and take several slow, deep breaths, focusing on the rise and fall of your chest. As your body becomes more relaxed, allow your mind to become still and open to the experience.

2. Visualize a vast, cosmic ocean, filled with the energy and essence of the universe. As you gaze upon this vast expanse, recognize the dual aspects of existence - light and dark, masculine and feminine, creation and destruction - all of which stem from the same universal source.

3. Next, visualize a point of pure light emerging from the darkness, representing the unity of existence. This point expands in all directions, eventually forming a perfect circle. This sacred geometry symbolizes the interconnectedness of reality through the principles of Liber vel Ararita.

4. As you focus on this circle, see the light begin to separate into the elemental colors associated with the different aspects of the macrocosm: red for fire, blue for water, yellow for air, and green for earth. These intermingling colors represent the divine planetary energies that originate from the same source.

5. Now, imagine a series of nested circles or spheres, each encompassing the other. These spheres correspond to the stages of initiation within Liber vel Ararita, with each layer revealing deeper insights into non-duality. As you journey through these spheres, you will uncover the mysteries of existence and the ultimate unity that permeates all.

6. With each successive sphere, visualize yourself merging with the energies, colors, and elements associated with that realm. This process symbolizes your expanding understanding of non-duality and the interconnectedness of all aspects of existence.

7. As you reach the final sphere, feel the dissolution of boundaries between yourself and the universe, transcending the illusion of duality and becoming one with the ultimate source.

Guided Meditation Script:

Begin by focusing on your breath and repeating to yourself the following passage from Liber vel Ararita:

"Unity uttermost showed! I adore the might of Thy breath, Supreme and terrible God, Who makest the Gods and death to tremble before Thee."

As you resonate with these words, allow your visualization to unfold, guided by the principles and imagery of Liber vel Ararita. Trust in the process and remember that you are diving deep into the mysteries of existence and the true nature of non-duality.

As you move through the spheres and connect with the sacred energies of the universe, repeat this passage:

"By the power of the hidden knowledge of the symbols, I make the Great Work, uniting macrocosm and microcosm."

Allow yourself to fully embrace the truth of non-duality and see the interconnectedness of all that exists.

As the visualization draws to a close, and your understanding of non-duality has been cultivated, set an intention to carry this wisdom into your daily life. **Say these words to bring yourself back to the present**:

"I am a star, a shining seed of unity within the vast cosmic ocean, reflecting the divine light of the One."

Slowly open your eyes and take a few deep breaths, returning to your body and surroundings. Contemplate the insights gained during your practice, and know that you have taken another step on the path of spiritual growth and enlightenment through the wisdom of Liber vel Ararita.
