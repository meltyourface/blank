To perform this meticulously detailed Veil ritual for summoning one's higher self, follow these ten steps, each corresponding to a particular aspect of the higher self. 

1. **Purification of Self**: Begin by cleansing yourself, both physically and spiritually. Take a bath infused with rosemary, lavender, and frankincense oils, focusing on releasing negative energies from your body and mind. Meditate upon the ancient chant, "Aperio Lumina Vera," which translates to "Open the True Light." This chant connects you to the purity of your higher self.

2. **Assembling Artifacts**: Gather sacred occult artifacts that represent the higher self. These items may include a quartz crystal, a silver chalice, an athame, a pentacle, a censer with incense, white candles, and a ceremonial robe. Each item will play a role in the ritual, acting as a physical representation of various aspects of the higher self, enhancing spiritual connection.

3. **Preparing the Sacred Space**: Choose a quiet, secluded area where you can perform the ritual undisturbed, either indoors or outdoors. Purify the space by smudging with sage, and then draw a circle on the floor or ground using white chalk or salt. The circle represents the sphere of your consciousness, preparing you to connect to the higher self outside of the mundane world.

4. **Consecration of Artifacts**: Arrange the gathered artifacts according to the cardinal directions within the sacred circle. Light the white candles at each cardinal point (North, East, South, West), the censer with incense and place it in the center. Hold the athame or wand, and recite the ancient mystical chant, "Consacro Mysterium," ("I consecrate the mystery") as you touch each artifact. This action imbues each item with spiritual energy, preparing it for the ritual.

5. **Invocation of Divine Energies**: Once the artifacts are consecrated, face east, and lift your arms skyward. Invoke divine energies by reciting the ancient chant, "Adveni Divinitatis," which translates to "Come Forth Divinity." At this moment, visualize the energies of the universe flowing down through your crown chakra and root chakra, connecting you to the divine cosmos.

6. **Opening the Veil**: Stand in the center of the circle, facing north. Perform the "Sign of the Revealer," a complex esoteric gesture that involves forming inverted triangles with both hands and extending them outward into the shape of an open door. As you do this, recite the ancient chant, "Aperio Velum," which means "Open the Veil." This act opens the gateway between the mundane world and the higher realms.

7. **Ascension of Consciousness**: Meditate upon the symbolic ascent of your consciousness through the spiritual planes. Visualize each plane as a color on a spectrum, moving from the densest, red energy, to the highest, violet energy. Use the chant, "Ascendo in Lumine," or "I rise in the light," to aid your visualization and draw your consciousness closer to your higher self.

8. **Communion with the Higher Self**: Once you have ascended through the planes, sit comfortably in the circle's center, holding the quartz crystal. Close your eyes and recite the chant, "Veni Summum Ego," which means "Come, Higher Self." Open yourself to receive guidance and wisdom from your higher self and listen intently to any messages you may receive.

9. **Gratitude and Return**: After you have communed with your higher self, offer thanks by reciting the chant, "Gratias ago," or "I give thanks." Then, perform the Sign of the Revealer once more, this time envisioning the door closing, and recite, "Claudo Velum," or "Close the Veil." This action brings your consciousness back to the physical world, carrying with it the insights and wisdom obtained during the ritual.

10. **Closing the Sacred Space**: Extinguish the candles and censer, and carefully disassemble the circle. Thank the energies and artifacts for their assistance and open yourself to manifesting the insights you have acquired in your daily life.

The philosophical connection between the Veil and the higher self revolves around the concept that the Veil acts as the gateway between the physical and spiritual realms. By opening the Veil, we permit our consciousness to transcend the limitations of the mundane world and achieve communion with our higher selves, gaining wisdom and insight to facilitate personal growth and healing.
