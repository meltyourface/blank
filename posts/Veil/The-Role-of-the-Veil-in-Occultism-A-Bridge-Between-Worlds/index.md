The challenge at hand involves the exploration and analysis of the concept of the Veil within the context of occultism. **To provide a comprehensive response, this answer will elaborate on the following aspects**:

1. The Veil's role in concealing higher truths
2. The relationship between the physical and non-physical realms as it pertains to the Veil
3. **The role of symbolism in bridging these worlds**
4. **The ultimate unveiling of the hidden nature of reality**

1. The Veil's Role in Concealing Higher Truths

The Veil, as a concept in occultism, refers to the metaphorical and often invisible barrier separating the mundane world of everyday experience from the higher, more abstract truths that lie hidden beneath the surface. This barrier is said to be intentionally placed to protect these higher truths from being accessed and misused by those who are unprepared or lack the necessary understanding to wield such knowledge responsibly. The nature of the Veil makes it difficult for individuals to encounter these truths readily, demanding sincere dedication and disciplined practice for one to pierce its veil and access the concealed wisdom.

2. The Relationship between the Physical and Non-Physical Realms

The Veil not only separates mundane and esoteric truths but also serves as the divide between the physical and non-physical realms. The physical realm, often referred to as the world of matter or the plane of manifestation, encompasses the tangible aspects of reality that can be perceived through the five senses. In contrast, the non-physical realm comprises layers of reality that exist beyond the senses, spanning dimensions of consciousness, energy, and spirit.

The Veil obscures the connection between these two realms, with the implication that individuals living in the physical world may not be aware of the profound influence that non-physical forces have on their lives and the broader reality they inhabit. In this way, the Veil maintains the illusion of separation between the physical and non-physical, as well as between the individual self and the interconnectedness of everything that exists.

3. **The Role of Symbolism in Bridging These Worlds**

To bridge the gap between the physical and non-physical realms, occultism employs symbolism as an essential tool. Symbols are images, signs, or representations that hold deeper meaning beyond their literal appearance. They serve as concentrative focal points that encapsulate and convey complex ideas, reflecting the hidden layers of reality within the limitations of human language and comprehension. When properly utilized, symbolism can provide initiates with a means to access the higher truths concealed by the Veil.

Through rituals, meditation, and the study of esoteric texts and art, practitioners gradually decode and internalize these symbols, attuning themselves to their deeper meanings. Symbolism serves as a type of spiritual language that transcends the limitations of the rational mind, enabling communication with non-physical realities, otherworldly entities, and higher aspects of the self.

4. **The Ultimate Unveiling of the Hidden Nature of Reality**

The process of unveiling the hidden nature of reality involves not only the piercing of the Veil to access higher truths but also the dissolution of the Veil itself. As one's understanding deepens, and the practitioner learns to navigate the subtle interconnections between the physical and non-physical realms, the metaphorical Veil gradually dissolves. Eventually, the need for symbolism dissipates as well, as the occultist reaches a state of direct gnosis or experiential knowledge that transcends symbolic representation.

In summary, the concept of the Veil in occultism serves to protect higher truths while simultaneously challenging and guiding sincere practitioners to attain deeper levels of understanding. Through the establishment of the Veil, the relationship between the physical and non-physical realms is emphasized, and the necessity of symbolism as a bridge between these realms is underscored. Through dedicated practice and the unraveling of symbolic representations, the hidden nature of reality is unveiled. It is important to note that this process is individual and incremental, as each person's journey through the Veil is unique and marked by their own discoveries and revelations.
