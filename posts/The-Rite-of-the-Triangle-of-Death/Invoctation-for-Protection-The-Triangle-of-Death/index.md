I call upon the ancient secrets and the wisdom of the Triangle of Death to create a potent incantation that shall guard my being and ward off any harm that may come my way.

From the depths of the forgotten realms, I summon the Eye of Purity, the Blade of Shadows, and the Sigil of Sacrifice.

First, I draw the Eye of Purity - the symbol of unadulterated foresight, bringing forth the divine power to perceive any hidden danger and deflect the deceitful intentions of those who wish me ill.

Ex oculo castitas veniat, custodem secretorum.

Next, I engrave the Blade of Shadows - the wielder of the dark veil, shrouding me in protection and granting me the ability to navigate through the most oppressive darkness, unharmed and unseen.

Per umbram gladii protegam, iter obscuritas revelam.

Finally, I inscribe the Sigil of Sacrifice - the emblem of boundless endurance and vitality, providing me with the fortitude to withstand forces beyond mortal comprehension and emerge triumphant from every tribulation.

Insigne sacrificium, robur indefessum adducam.

Through the blood-bound connection, I establish the sacred geometry of the Triangle of Death, using its power to amplify the energies of these three sigils. I invoke their union, creating layers of defense to safeguard my body and spirit from physical and metaphysical transgressions.

Triangulum mortis concordiam facio, vim sigillorum accendo.

As I speak these words, I feel the forces of the Triangle of Death surround me, their energies intertwining and forming an impervious barrier of protection, only to be penetrated by the chosen and the worthy. By the power of the Eye of Purity, the Blade of Shadows, and the Sigil of Sacrifice:

Aegide trianguli mortis, invincibilis me reddam!

So it is set. My being is now encased in the ultimate shield of protection, a vessel guided and guarded by the ancient knowledge and sacred sigils of the Triangle of Death. May it stand firm and unyielding against the tests of time and the dark force throughout my life's journey.
