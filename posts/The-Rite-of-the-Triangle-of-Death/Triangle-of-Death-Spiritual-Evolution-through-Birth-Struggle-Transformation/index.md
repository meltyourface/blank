To begin our exploration of the Triangle of Death and its relation to the three stages of human spiritual evolution, we must first establish a solid understanding of the core concepts involved. The Triangle of Death, as a cornerstone of esoteric teachings, is a rite that revolves around three key points: birth, struggle, and transformation. In esotericism, spiritual evolution is often divided into three major stages: awakening, purification, and illumination. We will focus on drawing connections between these respective points and stages for a comprehensive understanding of their relationship and the potential transcendence of mortality.

1. Birth (Awakening):
The first point in the Triangle of Death, birth, bears a strong connection to the initial stage of human spiritual evolution, awakening. Just as physical birth marks the beginning of our life journey, the awakening stage represents the moment when one becomes aware of their spiritual self and the existence of a deeper, cosmic reality beyond the material world.

During this stage, an individual may experience moments of heightened intuition, psychic sensitivity, or other events that provoke a questioning of conventional perceptions. Examples of such experiences could be profound encounters with nature, personal tragedies, or even the study of esoteric teachings like the Rite of the Triangle of Death itself.

By embracing the concept of spiritual birth, initiates using the Triangle of Death can begin their path towards greater knowledge and understanding of life, death, and the cycle of existence.

2. Struggle (Purification):
The second point of the Triangle of Death, struggle, aligns with the purification stage of human spiritual evolution. Just as struggle is an innate part of life, often shaping us into stronger and more resilient individuals, the purification stage involves facing our inner demons, fears, and negative traits to create a more refined and enlightened self.

This internal battle can manifest in various ways, such as overcoming addictions, conquering limiting beliefs, or even embracing the shadow aspects of the self through meditation and shadow work. One example of an exercise during this phase is the practice of mindfulness. By focusing on self-awareness and the present moment, a participant in the Rite of the Triangle of Death learns to scrutinize and quiet their mind, ultimately shedding unproductive habits and attachments.

Through spiritual purification, initiates using the Triangle of Death can gain mastery over their lower selves and strengthen their resolve to face the challenges of existence.

3. Transformation (Illumination):
The final point in the Triangle of Death, transformation, correlates to the illumination stage of human spiritual evolution. Just as the caterpillar metamorphoses into a butterfly, the concept of transformation signifies profound change and growth. Reaching this stage is an indication that the initiate has successfully navigated the trials and tribulations of existence, emerging as a wiser and more spiritually refined being.

Achieving transformation and illumination calls for the culmination of various practices such as consistent meditation, energy work, and deep introspection. A specific example of mastery in this stage could be the attainment of an out-of-body experience or astral projection, wherein an adept is no longer constrained by the physical body and delves into the ethereal realms.

Upon reaching this stage of illumination, participants in the Rite of the Triangle of Death possess the potential to transcend the limitations of mortality by truly understanding the cyclical nature of existence and potentially accessing spiritual realms beyond the material world.

In summary, the three points of the Triangle of Death—birth, struggle, and transformation—are intrinsically connected to the three stages of human spiritual evolution: awakening, purification, and illumination. As initiates walk the path of the Triangle of Death and progress through these stages, they gain a deeper understanding of the cycles of life and death that govern all existence. This mastering of the Rite enables them to elevate themselves spiritually, transcending the constraints of mortality and potentially accessing otherworldly planes of existence.
