To begin my pathworking journey, I set up the Occult laboratory meticulously, ensuring all necessary tools and instruments are present and arranged according to tradition. Items such as the black mirror, crystal sphere, ceremonial attire, incense, and candles are prepared.

I commence my pathworking practice through meditation and entering a state of altered consciousness, seeking to establish a connection to the divine forces present within the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Once I have entered a receptive mindset, I begin invoking the energies and presences of each Sephirah, starting with Malkuth, the Kingdom.

Throughout my time traversing the realm of Malkuth, I employ the black mirror to scry and witness the archetypes, divine emanations, and astral beings that dwell within this realm. I witness the solidity, stability, and the fundamental principles of the physical world, meeting figures associated with the elements and Mother Earth. I document my experiences and the wisdom gleaned from Malkuth before ascending towards the next Sephirah.

Continuing up the Tree, I venture into the realms of Yesod (Foundation), Hod (Splendor), Netzach (Victory), and Tiphereth (Beauty). In each domain, I practice advanced scrying techniques, using tools like the crystal sphere, to visualize and commune with the native inhabitants of each sphere. Here, I delve into the complexities of the subconscious, intellect, emotion, and the refined balance point of energies. Each sphere reveals its enigmatic esoteric symbolism and yields its unique gifts of insight, which I thoroughly document.

Ascending higher, I traverse the spheres of Geburah (Severity), Chesed (Mercy), Binah (Understanding), and Chokmah (Wisdom). In these realms, I confront the divine forces associated with judgment, compassion, the archetypal feminine, and the primordial masculine. Meditating on these energies and communing with the entities within each Sephirah, I decrypt their cryptic symbols and unravel the interconnected wisdom of the higher realms.

Finally, I reach Kether, the Crown. Here, I find the essence of pure consciousness and the Divine Source itself. In this state of ecstatic unity, I am immersed in the profound understanding of the interconnected Universe, transcending the boundaries of mundane awareness. The wisdom acquired from this experience deepens my comprehension of existence and connection to the divine.

Returning from this transformative mystical journey, I review and analyze the meticulous documentation of my experiences and encounters during the pathworking practice. Integrating the newfound wisdom and perspectives within my daily life, I continue to expand my consciousness, while also sharing insights with others who seek enlightenment and transformation.

As a master of the Occult laboratory, I have navigated and thoroughly explored each Sephirah of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life through advanced scrying techniques, meditation, and ritualistic invocations. This complex and profound magickal experience has imparted deep wisdom, enriching not only my own understanding but also my contribution to the esoteric community.
