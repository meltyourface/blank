To complete this task, I will first gather relevant information about the ancient Zmei artifact. Based on the artifact's unique origin and intended arcane outcome, I will arrange the esoteric Zmei symbols and runes in a specific order to activate the latent mystical energies effectively.

1. Artifact Analysis: Investigate and understand the artifact's unique properties, origin, and its historical and mystical significance.

2. Intended Arcane Outcome: Determine the desired effects and results of activating the latent mystical energies within the artifact. This information may be found in ancient texts, through divination, or intuitive interpretation.

3. Symbol and Rune Selection: Select the appropriate Zmei symbols and runes that best resonate with the artifact's unique properties, origin, and intended arcane outcome.

4. Sequence Development: Arrange the symbols and runes in a precise sequence while considering the following factors:
 a. Spatial Relation: Each symbol and rune's positioning on the artifact must align with the specific energy channels and flow within the relic.
 b. Synergistic Interaction: The selected symbols and runes should work in harmony to amplify and direct the artifacts latent energies effectively.
 c. Balance: Ensure that the sequence creates a balance between different aspects (e.g., light and dark, order and chaos), as required by the artifact's nature and intended outcome.

5. Activation and Incantation: Once the sequence has been determined, activate the artifact by inscribing the symbols and runes onto the artifact while chanting specific Zmei mantras and incantations to imbue the necessary energies and activate the latent mystical powers.

In conclusion, by understanding the artifact's unique properties and intended arcane outcome, selecting the appropriate symbols and runes, arranging them in a precise sequence, and utilizing Zmei incantations, the latent mystical energies within the ancient Zmei artifact can be successfully activated.
