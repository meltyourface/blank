Ritualistic Practices

1. Algoros: Construct an earthly altar, with a staff encircled by a serpent at its center. Meditate on the aspects of discipline, patience, and wisdom desired. Perform the ritual during the waning crescent moon phase to augment the influences of Saturn.

2. Volaris: Set up an altar adorned with feathers and symbols of air. Perform a wind dance, fluidly moving through the space, invoking Volaris through gestures and spoken word. Opt for the waxing crescent moon phase to align with Mercury's energies.

3. Pyroz: Create a fire pit or light candles on your altar. Focus on the intentions of courage, motivation, and strength. As the flames rise, invoke Pyroz, allowing the heat to empower your desires. Perform this ritual on the full moon.

4. Aquastra: Establish an altar near a water source, or with a bowl of water placed on it. Engage in a ritual bath, allowing the water to cleanse and heal emotional wounds. Invoke Aquastra during the new moon to enhance emotional connectivity.

5. Terros: Stand on a patch of fertile soil to feel the energies of the earth. Construct an altar with a depiction of a mountain or shield. Meditate on protection and growth, invoking Terros' presence on the waxing gibbous moon phase.

6. Lumina: Design an altar with golden cloth, sunflowers, and citrine crystals. Meditate outdoors under the sun, cultivating feelings of warmth and creativity. Acknowledge Lumina's presence on the full moon, basking in the sun's radiant energy.

7. Selune: Adorn an altar with moonstones, selenite, and a vessel of water to reflect the moonlight. Meditate on dreams, intuition, and emotional openness. Invoke Selune's presence during the new moon, welcoming her influence on the subconscious realm.
