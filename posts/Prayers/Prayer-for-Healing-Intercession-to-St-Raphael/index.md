In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

Glorious St. Raphael, patron saint of healers,
Whose tender mercy and celestial wisdom,
Lend comfort to the weary and solace to the despairing,
We humbly beseech thee to intercede for our beloved ________,
Whose body is ailing and spirit cries out for reprieve.

In gratitude, we honor thee as the divine bearer of God's healing grace,
Your calming touch and watchful gaze guiding each step of our journey,
Through the shifting sands of fortune and the storms of adversity,
We lay bare our hearts in supplication for your steadfast support.

By the eternal flame of empathy ever burning within your radiant soul,
Feel the depth of our shared suffering,
And let the shimmering rays of your clemency cascade upon our weary spirits,
Illuminating the silent corridors where hope may yet take root.

Oh, merciful healer, grace us with the balm of transcendental comfort,
Whereupon our faith may flourish in verdant abundance,
And enable us to find hope amid the darkest of nights,
Steadfast in our belief that on the morrow, dawn breaks anew.

As the mellifluous notes of ancient hymns rise to the heavens,
The chant of "Ubi Caritas et Amor" resounding in unity with our plea;
So, too, do we extend our plea to thee, benevolent St. Raphael,
Whose divine intervention we fervently seek in this time of need.

Now, we humbly call upon the Lord's infinite mercy,
To restore and nourish our beloved ________,
Surging through the wellspring of His boundless compassion,
As we continue to trust in the healing power of His grace.

In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
Amen.
