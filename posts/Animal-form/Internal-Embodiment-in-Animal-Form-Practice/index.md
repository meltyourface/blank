- A neophyte augmenting their spiritual abilities by internally embodying the characteristics of their animal form, rather than physically transforming.

In the study of occultism, animal forms hold great importance due to their unique attributes and spiritual significance. Esoteric principles of Animal form place emphasis on the connection between a practitioner and their chosen animal. In the given options, the most accurate demonstration of the precise blending of energies and knowledge between a practitioner and their chosen animal is a neophyte augmenting their spiritual abilities by internally embodying the characteristics of their animal form, rather than physically transforming.

This choice encapsulates the essence of Animal form practice, as it underscores the importance of understanding and aligning with the energies, attributes, and spirit of the chosen animal. By focusing on the internal embodiment of the characteristics, the neophyte can better integrate these qualities into their spiritual practice and growth. This method of blending energies and knowledge is less about the physical transformation and more about the inner spiritual transformation, which is a fundamental aspect of the esoteric and occult practices.

The other options, although related to the Animal form practice, they do not exemplify the precise blending of energies and knowledge. For example, the adept shape-shifter gaining insight into the secrets of flight through the study of birds is a tangential aspect of Animal form. It demonstrates the acquisition of knowledge about the animal, but it doesn't necessarily involve the blending of energies or spiritual connection.

Similarly, the practitioner using the symbolism of a snake to transform and transmute negative energy into healing power showcases the utilization of animal symbolism, but it is not focused on the integration of the animal's energies or attributes within the practitioner's spiritual practice.

Lastly, the sorcerer maintaining control over their animal form by consistently studying and participating in the activities of that animal displays dedication to the chosen animal and understanding its physical aspects but does not delve into the deeper spiritual connection necessary for true harmony between the practitioner and their animal form.

In conclusion, the neophyte augmenting their spiritual abilities by internally embodying the characteristics of their animal form best demonstrates the blending of energies and knowledge in the practice of Animal form. This approach places emphasis on the spiritual transformation, understanding the spirit of the chosen animal, and the integration of their unique energies and attributes into the practitioner's own spiritual journey.
