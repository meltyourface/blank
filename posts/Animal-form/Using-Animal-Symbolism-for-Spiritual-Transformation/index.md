The correct answer is:
- Utilizing the symbolism of animals in a ritualistic sense to develop and enhance the practitioner's understanding of the natural world and draw upon spiritual and energetic aspects related to the animal form.

Explanation and context:

Animal forms have played a significant role in the study of the occult and esoteric practices throughout history. This practice is rooted in the belief that certain animals possess unique qualities and energies that can be harnessed by practitioners for various purposes. The reasoning behind choosing this answer lies in the deep connection between the symbolic aspect of animals and the spiritual and energetic aspects of esoteric practices.

The other options do not fully capture the essence of animal forms in the study of the occult. For example, gaining physical attributes while retaining human intellect emphasizes the practical aspects of the transformation but overlooks the spiritual significance, which is a fundamental aspect of the esoteric. 

Similarly, the belief in the inherent duality of humans and animals, while recognizing the shared characteristics between the two, does not delve into the practical applications of such knowledge. This answer is limited to the theoretical understanding of the connection without discussing the practical applications or focusing on the utilization of animal forms in rituals.

Lastly, changing one's form into an animal solely for espionage misses the point of animal forms in the study of the occult. It completely disregards the deeper spiritual, ritualistic, and symbolic connections that are integral to understanding and practicing animal forms in a metaphysical context.

To fully grasp the concept of animal forms in the study of the occult, it is essential to appreciate the symbiosis between the physical, symbolic, and spiritual aspects of these transformations. This includes understanding the historical and cultural significance of various animal forms, such as Egyptian deities who possess animal heads, Native American shapeshifter legends, and European folklore featuring werewolves.

In summary, the correct answer highlights the importance of utilizing animal symbolism and ritualistic practices to deepen one's understanding of the natural world and draw upon the spiritual and energetic aspects associated with the animal form. This comprehensive understanding allows for a thorough exploration of the metaphysical applications of animal forms in esoteric practices and paves the way for continued advancement in the field of the occult.
