  In the context of mythical shapeshifters across cultures, alchemical transmutation, and modern esoteric interpretation, present an analysis of how Animal form as an occult concept symbolizes both spiritual and psychological transformation \u2013 drawing connections with the symbolism of at least three distinct cultures' mythologies and one of Carl Jung's psychological theories.

To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, it is essential to delve into the depths of various cultural mythologies and their connection with the concept of shapeshifting or Animal form. Furthermore, such analysis must touch upon the field of alchemy and its transmutations as well as on the psychological theories proposed by Carl Jung. 

To begin with, shapeshifting or Animal form is a phenomenon often linked to the spiritual and psychological transformation encountered across various mythologies, cultures, and esoteric interpretations. ****It is vital to examine the symbolism of Animal form within three distinct cultural mythologies****: Native American, Norse, and Greek, before connecting these concepts to Carl Jung's theory of the archetypes and the collective unconscious.

In Native American mythology, the idea of Animal form is deeply woven into their spiritual, cultural, and religious beliefs. The concept of the shapeshifting shaman or "Skinswalker" is a key element in this tradition. The Skinswalker, often depicted as an individual capable of transforming into different animal forms, symbolizes the shaman's ability to transcend the material realm and connect with the spiritual world. This transformational process allows the Skinswalker to gain knowledge, heal others, and commune with animal spirits. In this context, Animal form represents a spiritual journey towards self-discovery and enlightenment, as well as the interconnectedness between all living things.

In Norse mythology, the ability to shift into Animal form is associated with powerful deities such as Odin and Loki. For example, Odin, the chief god and Norse god of wisdom, often transformed into various animal forms to attain knowledge, strength, or even to deceive others. On the other hand, Loki, the trickster god, often used shapeshifting as a means of deception and manipulation. In this context, Animal form has a dual context in Norse mythology; it can symbolize the transformative wisdom and the hidden depths of the mind or depict the darker side of manipulation and deception. 

Greek mythology also has numerous examples of animal transformation, and one such example can be seen in the story of Zeus and Leda. Zeus, the father of gods, was notorious for his shape-shifting abilities, which he often used to pursue romantic interests. In the story of Zeus and Leda, Zeus transforms into a swan to seduce Leda, who later gives birth to two sets of twins, one mortal and one divine. Here, Animal form represents not only the transformative power but also the duality of human nature, as the offspring from this union underscore the constant intertwining of divinity and mortality.

In relation to alchemical transmutation, the concept of turning base metals into gold is highly symbolic of spiritual transformation, self-improvement, and the pursuit of higher knowledge. Similar to shapeshifting and transcending material boundaries, alchemy's processes mirror that of personal growth and inner development, as the alchemist works to purify and refine substances to unlock their higher potential. Alchemical transmutation aligns with the symbolism of Animal form as both involve a transformative process that overcomes the limitations of their current state to achieve a higher level of understanding and existence.

Connecting these mythological and alchemical contexts to Carl Jung's psychological theories, one can find striking parallels. Jung's concepts of archetypes and the collective unconscious revolve around the idea that human beings have common experiences, symbols, and images embedded in their psyche throughout history. Animal forms, like those from the mythologies examined earlier, can be seen as archetypal symbols representing the transformative aspects of human experiences. These shared symbols allude to the growth, challenges, and inspirations we face in the process of becoming our true selves.

In conclusion, the concept of Animal form as a symbol of spiritual and psychological transformation is found across various mythologies, including Native American, Norse, and Greek, as well as in the esoteric field of alchemical transmutation. These cultures and traditions utilize Animal form to express various aspects of personal growth, enlightenment, and the human connection to the divine. Furthermore, Carl Jung's psychological theories, specifically the archetypes and collective unconscious, provide a contemporary approach for interpreting Animal form and its deeper significance in the pursuit of self-discovery, growth, and transformation.
