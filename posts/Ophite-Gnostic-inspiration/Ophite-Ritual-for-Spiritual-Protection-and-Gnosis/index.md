To design and perform an elaborate ritual to invoke the seven Ophite Archons, focusing on Sophia's divine wisdom and the Serpent as the liberator for the purpose of achieving an unwavering spiritual shield against negative forces and achieving transcendent gnosis, follow these steps:
**Step 1**: Preparation
Gather the following materials:

- Sacred texts containing Ophite Gnostic teachings (e.g., the Pistis Sophia, the Apocryphon of John, and the Books of Jeu)
- Seven candles representing each of the seven Ophite Archons
- A serpent statue or image to symbolize the liberator and the divine wisdom
- Incense and a censer to cleanse the space and elevate the energies
- A chalice filled with water or wine to symbolize divine knowledge and the element of water
- An athame (ritual dagger) or a wand to symbolize the element of air and the conscious mind
- A bowl of salt or earth to symbolize grounding and the element of earth
- A candle, torch, or brazier to represent the element of fire and transformative energy
**Step 2**: Creating the Sacred Space
Cleanse and purify the space by burning incense, then arrange the seven candles in a circle around the serpent statue or image. 
**Step 3**: Invocation of the Four Elements
Start by invoking the four elements at their corresponding cardinal directions:

- East: Air and the conscious mind. ****Hold the athame or wand and recite the following invocation****: "I call upon the element of Air, the breath of wisdom, and the force of change to join me in this sacred space."

- South: Fire and transformative energy. ****Hold the fire symbol and recite****: "I call upon the element of Fire, the flame of knowledge, and the force of creation to join me in this sacred space."

- West: Water and divine knowledge. ****Hold the chalice and recite****: "I call upon the element of Water, the river of intuition, and the force of emotion to join me in this sacred space."

- North: Earth and grounding energy. ****Hold the bowl of salt or earth and recite****: "I call upon the element of Earth, the foundation of stability, and the force of growth to join me in this sacred space."
**Step 4**: Invocation of the Seven Ophite Archons
Ignite each of the seven candles while invoking the name of each Ophite Archon:

1. Ialdabaoth - Chief Archon and the Lion-faced
2. Saklas - Arrogant and powerful
3. Samael - Blind god of chaos
4. Elaios - Known as the God of the elements, guardian of earth
5. Astaphaios - Guardian of water
6. Adonaios - Guardian of fire
7. Sabaoth - Guardian of air

Recite the following invocation: "I invoke and call upon the Seven Ophite Archons, celestial beings of divine wisdom and power, to join me in this sacred space."
**Step 5**: Invocation of Sophia and the Serpent
Hold the serpent statue or image and recite the following invocation: "I, a seeker of transcendent gnosis, call upon you, Sophia, divine wisdom, and the Serpent, the liberator, the great guiding force of my soul. Grant me the power to achieve an unwavering spiritual shield against negative forces and align me with your divine knowledge and wisdom."
**Step 6**: Chant from Sacred Texts and Meditation
Select passages or chants from the Ophite Gnostic sacred texts such as: "Pistis Sophia, guide me on the path of liberation. Apocryphon of John, reveal to me the secrets of divine knowledge..."

Meditate on the meaning and energy of the words, allowing yourself to connect with the divine wisdom and protection of the Ophite Archons, Sophia, and the Serpent.
**Step 7**: Closing the Ritual
Thank each of the Ophite Archons, Sophia, and the Serpent for their presence and guidance. Send them back to their respective realms with gratitude. Close the circle by dismissing the elements, starting with the north (earth) and going counter-clockwise.

Remember to extinguish all candles and safely store all materials as you leave the sacred space feeling spiritually protected and enlightened.
