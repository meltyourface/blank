1. **Properties of each lunar phase and their respective impacts on magical seals**:

- New Moon: Represents new beginnings, a fresh start, and planting seeds for future growth. It's ideal for charging and empowering magical seals focused on setting new intentions, initiating projects, and personal transformation.

- Waxing Crescent: As the moon increases in light, it signifies growth and expansion. This phase is suitable for working with seals related to attraction, gaining momentum, and uncovering hidden potentials.

- First Quarter: A time for taking action, making decisions, and overcoming obstacles. Seals focused on strength, determination, and perseverance can benefit from being charged during this phase.

- Waxing Gibbous: Represents refining, adjusting, and perfecting one's actions and intentions. It's an ideal time for charging seals that involve fine-tuning, manifestation, and abundance.

- Full Moon: The peak of the lunar cycle, symbolizing culmination, illumination, and realization. Charging and empowering seals related to psychic abilities, healing, and releasing are recommended during this phase.

- Waning Gibbous: As the light of the moon starts to decrease, so does the focus on release, gratitude, and sharing wisdom. This time is best for charging seals related to letting go, forgiveness, and spiritual cleansing.

- Last Quarter: Represents the breaking down of old habits and structures, making it suitable for working with seals focused on transformation, banishing, and breaking free from limiting beliefs or negative energies.

- Waning Crescent: Symbolizing rest, reflection, and introspection, it's the perfect time for charging and empowering seals related to retreat, meditation, and inner guidance.

2. **Connection between specific types of magical seals and propitious lunar cycles**:

- Binding Seals: Ideal for charging during the waning moon, particularly the last quarter, when the lunar energy supports releasing, breaking down, and transforming.

- Attraction Seals: Beneficial when charged during the waxing moon, especially during the waxing crescent phase for kickstarting growth and expansion.

3. **Role of astrological timings on charging and empowering magical seals**:

- Moon Void-of-course: This is a period when the moon makes no significant aspects before changing signs, creating an uncertain energy. It's best to avoid charging seals during this time.

- Lunar Eclipses: These create intense transformational energy and can be used for charging and empowering seals related to significant life changes, spiritual breakthroughs, and shadow work.

- Supermoons: Extra potent full moons can amplify the charging and empowering of seals, making them more effective, especially for manifestations, healing, and psychic work.

4. **Immersive ritual for charging and empowering seals**:

1. Determine the most appropriate lunar phase for your seal.
2. Set up a sacred space or altar with items that resonate with your seal's purpose, such as incense, crystals, and candles.
3. Ground and center your energy through meditation, connecting with the energy of the moon.
4. Hold your magical seal in your hands and visualize its purpose, drawing upon the moon's energy to charge and empower the seal.
5. Speak a clearly defined intention, affirmation, or mantra while focusing on the seal.
6. Close the ritual with gratitude and an offering to the moon.

5. **Example illustrations**:

- Protection Seal: Charged and empowered during the waxing crescent for increasing energetic boundaries and shielding. **Ideal lunar cycle**: Waxing Crescent.

- Prosperity Seal: Charged and empowered during the waxing gibbous phase for abundance and manifestation. **Ideal lunar cycle**: Waxing Gibbous.

- Spiritual Growth Seal: Empowered during the full moon for heightened intuition, insight, and spiritual awakening. **Ideal lunar cycle**: Full Moon.

6. **Safeguards and precautions**:

- Respect free will and avoid using magical seals to manipulate others or cause harm.
- Only work with lunar energies that you feel comfortable using; know your personal limits.
- Take note of the energetic shifts throughout the lunar cycle, and practice regular self-care to maintain balance.
- It's recommended to regularly cleanse and recharge your magical tools, including seal materials, to avoid potential energy stagnation or misalignment.
