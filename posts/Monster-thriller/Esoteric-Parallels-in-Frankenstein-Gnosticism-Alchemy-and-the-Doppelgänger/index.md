In Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," we can identify three distinct occult and esoteric parallels present within the characters' narrative arcs and their creation process. These parallels can be related to Gnosticism and alchemy, both prominent esoteric traditions that have influenced the broader Western esoteric tradition.

1. Gnostic Parallels:
Victor Frankenstein's pursuit of forbidden knowledge and his desire to become a god-like creator parallel the Gnostic pursuit of divine wisdom and the aspiration to transcend the human limitations. Gnosticism, a spiritual movement originating in the early Christian era, emphasizes the acquisition of hidden, divine knowledge (gnosis) to transform human nature and achieve self-realization. Victor's pursuit of knowledge and his eventual creation of life (in the form of the monster) reflect the Gnostic view of God as the supreme source of knowledge, and humanity's ultimate goal to transcend their mortal fate through wisdom and inner transformation.

2. Alchemical Parallels:
Victor Frankenstein's creation of the monster can be seen as an embodiment of the alchemical Magnum Opus, the Great Work of transforming base metals into gold or, more metaphorically, the transmutation of the human soul. Alchemy, an arcane spiritual and philosophical practice, has been influential in both Western and Eastern esoteric traditions. In the novel, Victor's scientific experiments are a metaphor for the alchemist's symbolic transformation of matter, where the elements are carefully combined and refined to achieve spiritual rebirth.

The Creature's formation from disparate, dismembered body parts represents the alchemical process of dissolution (solutio), and Victor's application of galvanic forces symbolizes the process of coagulation (coagulatio). Eventually, the Creature's tragic story reflects the failure to achieve the ultimate goal of integration and spiritual renewal, akin to the failed alchemist who cannot attain the Philosopher's Stone or the Elixir of Life.

3. The Doppelgänger Motif:
Lastly, the doppelgänger motif reflects esoteric beliefs concerning the dual nature of humankind and the struggle between the forces of light and darkness. In Frankenstein, the Creature serves as Victor's dark mirror image, a manifestation of his suppressed desires, fears, and unconsciousness. This reflection exemplifies the esoteric concept of the Shadow Self, a crucial aspect in both Gnostic and alchemical psychology, wherein an individual must confront their darker, unacknowledged aspects to achieve spiritual illumination and personal understanding.

These three esoteric parallels intertwine to deliver profound insight into the spiritual and psychological dimensions of monsters and human nature. By weaving together Gnostic and alchemical themes, Shelley ultimately explores both the light and dark sides of human nature through Victor's quest for god-like knowledge and his creation of a monstrous being that embodies humanity's darker instincts and fears.

In summary, Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" presents three distinct occult and esoteric parallels:
1. Gnostic parallels: Victor's quest for divine knowledge and the aspiration to transcend human limitations.
2. Alchemical parallels: The creation of the monster as a metaphor for the Magnum Opus, the ultimate transformation of matter and soul.
3. The doppelgänger motif: The Creature as Victor's Shadow Self, revealing the dual nature of humanity and their struggle with darkness.

Together, these themes reveal Mary Shelley's deep exploration of the spiritual and psychological dimensions of monsters and human nature, offering both cautionary and transformative insights into humanity's potential for both greatness and self-destruction.
