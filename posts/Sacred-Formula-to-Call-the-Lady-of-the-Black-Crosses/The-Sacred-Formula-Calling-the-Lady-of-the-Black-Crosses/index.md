To answer this knowledge challenge, let us first dissect it into its core components: the four cardinal directions, the elemental correspondences, the symbolism of the Black Crosses, the presence of the Lady of the Black Crosses, the specific rituals and offerings, and the potential dangers and ethical considerations.

1. The Four Cardinal Directions: These directions (North, East, South, and West) signify the spatial orientation and relation of the practitioner to the world and the cosmos. In many esoteric traditions, each direction is associated with specific energies, deities, or spiritual forces.

2. Elemental Correspondences: The four elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) correspond to the cardinal directions, the four aspects of the world, and the human psyche. Earth is associated with North, symbolizing stability, practicality, and materialism. Air is linked to the East, symbolizing intellect, communication, and change. Fire represents South, symbolizing will, passion, and transformation. Lastly, Water is correlated to the West, symbolizing emotions, intuition, and the collective unconscious.

3. Symbolism of the Black Crosses: The Black Crosses represent the intersection and balance of the four elements and the cardinal directions. It symbolizes the interconnectedness of the spiritual and the physical worlds, as well as the harmonization of opposites within the individual and the universe. The Lady of the Black Crosses is said to govern these intersections and serves as a reminder of the importance of equilibrium within all aspects of existence.

4. The Presence of the Lady of the Black Crosses: Calling the Lady of the Black Crosses requires a profound understanding and alignment of the cardinal directions and their elemental correspondences and a deep respect for her role as the guardian of the world's equilibrium. The practitioner must evoke the Lady's presence by connecting with her through their own awareness of these universal principles.

5. Specific Rituals and Offerings: To successfully perform the Sacred Formula to Call the Lady of the Black Crosses, a practitioner must undertake specific rituals involving several stages:

a) Cleansing and consecration: Before beginning the ritual, cleanse the ritual space and oneself through a purification ritual, such as smudging with sage or burning incense.

b) Setting the intention: At the center of the ritual space, place an altar containing objects and symbols representing the elements and the four cardinal directions to evoke their energies.

c) Invocation: Call upon the Lady of the Black Crosses by reciting a carefully crafted invocation that acknowledges her power, wisdom, and the harmonization of the elements and directions.

d) Offerings: Present offerings to the Lady that demonstrate your sincerity and embody your desired outcome's essence. Offerings could include candles, incense, or simple yet meaningful objects that symbolize your specific intentions.

e) Engaging with the Lady: Share your petitions and listen for her guidance through meditation or other forms of direct communication.

f) Closing the ritual: Gratefully thank the Lady of the Black Crosses for her presence and guidance, before respectfully releasing her energy and closing the ritual space.

6. Potential Dangers and Ethical Considerations: There are risks when dealing with powerful forces in the realms of occultism, such as improper usage, disrespect, or unintended consequences. Lack of understanding or carelessness can lead to harmful disruptions in the balance between the elements and the cardinal directions, causing physical, emotional, or spiritual harm. Ethical protocols must be in place to ensure that the practitioner is cautious, knowledgeable, and respectful throughout the entire process.

In summary, the Sacred Formula to Call the Lady of the Black Crosses requires a deep understanding of the four cardinal directions and their elemental correspondences, a respectful and ethical approach to occult practices, and the use of specific rituals and offerings.
