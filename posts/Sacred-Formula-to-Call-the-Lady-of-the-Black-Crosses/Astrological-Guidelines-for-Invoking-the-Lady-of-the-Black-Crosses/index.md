To create a detailed astrological chart for the successful performance of the Sacred Formula to Call the Lady of the Black Crosses, we must first understand the key celestial bodies and astrological aspects that play a significant role in this powerful ritual.

1. The Moon: The Lady of the Black Crosses is intrinsically linked to lunar energy, which represents intuition, mystery, and feminine power. As such, the Moon's phase and house are crucial in her summoning.

2. Venus: Symbolizing beauty, love, and harmony, Venus is the ruling planet of the Lady and has a direct influence on the strength and duration of her presence.

3. Mercury: Representing communications and the mind, Mercury plays a vital role in establishing the connection between the practitioner and the Lady.

4. Pluto: As the ruler of the underworld and transformation, Plutoâ€™s strength and aspects will contribute significantly to the potency of the ritual.

Now that we understand the significant celestial bodies, let us create the detailed astrological chart using these criteria:

A. Lunar Phase: The best time for performing the Sacred Formula is during the Full Moon or the New Moon. The Full Moon is when the Lady's power is at its peak, while the New Moon offers new beginnings and fresh insights.

B. Moon's House: The Moon should ideally reside in the 8th House, which is connected to spiritual transformation and occult knowledge.

C. Venus Alignment: Venus must either be in conjunction, sextile, or trine with the Moon. These aspects ensure a strong connection between the energies of Venus and the Moon, amplifying the ritual's potency.

D. Mercury's Position: Mercury, preferably in its own domicile (Gemini or Virgo), is crucial for facilitating clear communication and enhancing the practitioner's understanding of the Sacred Formula.

E. Pluto's Influence: Pluto should ideally form a trine or sextile aspect with the Moon, as these harmonious aspects increase the transformative power of the ritual.

Considering these factors, suitable celestial alignments for invoking the Lady of the Black Crosses might occur when:

- The Full Moon or New Moon is in Scorpio (ruled by Pluto) and in the 8th House.
- Venus resides in either Taurus or Libra and forms a conjunction, sextile, or trine aspect with the Moon.
- Mercury is in Gemini or Virgo, ensuring clear communication during the ritual.
- Pluto forms a trine or sextile aspect with the Moon, amplifying its transformative power.

In conclusion, these ideal astrological conditions not only ensure the successful performance of the Sacred Formula to Call the Lady of the Black Crosses but also directly influence the Lady's strength and presence's duration. By harnessing the power of celestial bodies and aligning oneself with these auspicious moments, practitioners can increase the potency of their rituals and forge a deep, unwavering connection with the Lady of the Black Crosses.
