Before you begin your engagement with the Lady of the Black Crosses, it is essential to prepare your mind, body, and environment to ensure a successful connection. Below are the detailed instructions to facilitate appropriate etiquette, ritual procedures, and communication methods when engaging with the Lady of the Black Crosses.

1. Prepare your environment: Find a quiet and sacred space where you can perform the ritual without interruptions. Cleanse the area using sage or any other cleansing herb, imagining the negative energy dissipating in the smoke. Arrange a small altar or shrine containing representations of the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water), as well as a black cross or a symbol representing the Lady of the Black Crosses.

2. Dress appropriately: Wear clean and comfortable clothing, preferably in dark colors as a symbol of respect for the Lady's domain. Avoid overly revealing clothes, as this might be considered disrespectful. You may also choose to adorn yourself with jewelry or talismans associated with the Lady of the Black Crosses.

3. Prepare offerings: Select suitable offerings as a symbol of gratitude for the Lady's assistance. Traditional offerings include fragrant flowers (particularly black roses), a chalice of wine (symbolizing the Lady's domain over the mysteries of life and death), and a small dish of honey (a representation of her sweet, nurturing nature).

4. Begin the invocation: Light a black candle and place it at the center of the altar. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to center yourself. Visualize the Lady of the Black Crosses enveloped in shadows, with the black crosses around her. Recite the following invocation to call forth her presence:

"Most revered Lady of the Black Crosses, Mistress of Mysteries,
I beseech thee to grace me with your presence.
In the dark corners of the night, reveal your wisdom and power.
On this sacred space, manifest and guide me through the shadows."

5. Make specific gestures: Trace a sigil of the Lady of the Black Crosses in the air with your dominant hand while maintaining your focus on her presence. You could also hold your hand in a gesture that symbolizes the union of the sacred and the profane, such as the Anjali Mudra (prayer position) or the Kaballah's Kohenic Blessing gesture.

6. Collaboration with spiritual assistants: Be respectful and gracious when engaging with the Lady's spiritual assistants in the Sacred Formula practice. Acknowledge their presence, offer gratitude for their guidance, and be willing to listen and learn from them. To strengthen the connection, recite the following:

"Sacred Formula, thou binder of the shadows,
Reveal the path to the spirits who serve the Lady.
For their guidance, wisdom, and protection,
I offer my gratitude and seek collaboration with thee."

7. Create a mutual bond: Communicate your intentions, needs, and desires with honesty and humility. Keep your mind open to any messages, visions, or sensations that the Lady or her spiritual assistants may bestow upon you. To establish a bond, you may recite:

"Lady of the Black Crosses, manifest and woven with the shadows,
With humility and honor, I step into your realm.
Together may we form a bond,
For the greater good and the mysteries of your domain."

8. Close the ritual: When your needs have been addressed, thank the Lady of the Black Crosses for her guidance and assistance. Slowly blow out the black candle and visualize her descending back into the shadows, leaving her blessings with you.

9. Meditate and reflect: After the ritual, take a moment to meditate and reflect on your experience. Journal your thoughts, insights, and any guidance you received from the Lady of the Black Crosses or her spiritual assistants. This will help you ensure continuous progress in your spiritual journey.

Remember that maintaining a respectful and humble approach throughout your engagement with the Lady of the Black Crosses is essential to ensure a successful connection and collaboration. Practicing these instructions diligently will allow you to harness the power of the Sacred Formula to Call the Lady of the Black Crosses effectively.
