excerpt: > 
  Craft a powerful incantation to augment one's inner insight and sagacity by delving into the sacred knowledge of Odin and the runes. Specifically, draw upon the influence of Raidho, Ansuz, and Kenaz runes, as these hold the keys to guidance, divine communication, and enlightenment. To amplify the potency of the spell, harness the energies of the Nine Worlds and incorporate their distinct attributes into the incantation's design. Finally, weave the essence of Sleipnir, Odin's eight-legged steed, into the spell to represent untethered traversal between realms, embodying a free-flowing exchange of wisdom and intuition between the caster and the universe.

Hear me now, ye mighty forces of the Nine Worlds,
As I call upon thee to grant the gifts of sagacity.
In the name of Odin, the Allfather, wise and knowing,
I conjure and command the divine power of runes three.

Raidho, rune of guidance, master of thine own path,
Guide my insight, that I may embrace wisdom's journey.
Ansuz, rune of divine whispers, bearer of spoken truth,
Bless me with thy illuminated voice, sacred and fiery.

Kenaz, rune of enlightenment, torch of hidden lore,
Shed light upon the darkness, kindling the sparks within.
Awaken, O energies of realms both far and nigh,
Let all their strengths and attributes become as one.

From Asgard's heights, where gods in splendor reign,
To Niflheim's icy depths, concealed in shadow's embrace.
Vanaheim's abundance, Alfheim's light, Svartalfheim's mysteries,
Midgard's might, Jotunheim's lore, Helheim's secrets untamed.

The cosmic tree, Yggdrasil's web, unites all realms entwined,
By Sleipnir's swift and untethered stride, traversing boundaries unseen.
Let my spirit ride the winds, unshackled and free,
To fill the void with wisdom and draw enlightenment near.

Invited I invite, the spirit of Sleipnir, Odin's majestic steed,
Bend in my favor, O noble one, and guide me along.
Encompassed by the Nine, I shall cross the boundaries,
The knowledge I seek will be mine, and only I alone.

By the godly might of Allfather, and the ancient knowledge so divine,
I invoke the power of Raidho, Ansuz, and Kenaz in this incantation of mine.
Come now, Providence, unite my wisdom with what the cosmos bears,
And unfold upon me, the seeker, the gift of insight and sagacious layers.

So it is uttered, and so it is made manifest,
Through the divine realms and Odin's infinite depth.
With runes combined, and powers hewn from the Nine,
I now embrace the sagacity that forever shall be mine.
