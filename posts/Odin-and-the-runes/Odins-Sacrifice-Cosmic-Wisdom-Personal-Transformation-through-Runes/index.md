Odin's Sacrifice at Yggdrasil:
The story of Odin's sacrifice at the World Tree, Yggdrasil, is an essential part of Norse mythology and occult tradition. It is primarily told in the Hávamál, a poem from the Poetic Edda, a collection of Old Norse poems. According to the story, Odin hung himself from Yggdrasil, pierced his side with a spear, and gazed downward into the well of Urd to gain immeasurable wisdom. He spent nine nights enduring the agony of his self-inflicted wounds and hunger without consuming any food or drink to acquire secret knowledge.

The Discovery of Runes:
During his sacrifice, Odin discovered the runes. Runes are a system of writing and a form of divination that was used by Germanic peoples during ancient times. The runes are not just ordinary scripts but are considered symbols of power, each containing its own meaning and esoteric significance. There are 24 runes in the Elder Futhark, the oldest runic alphabet.

Correlation Between Odin's Sacrifice and the Runes:
1. **Cosmic Balance**:
Odin's ordeal at the World Tree represents the delicate balance of cosmic forces. Yggdrasil, as the World Tree, connects the Nine Realms and is a representation of the universe. Odin's sacrifice alludes to the importance of maintaining the equilibrium between life and death, knowledge and ignorance, and power and humility. The runes, in turn, represent these cosmic forces and contain the wisdom acquired by Odin through his sacrifice. By understanding the runes, one can utilize their power to maintain and harmonize the cosmic balance.

2. **Wisdom**:
Odin's sacrifice at Yggdrasil emphasizes his unquenchable thirst for knowledge and the lengths to which he would go to acquire wisdom. Just like the Hávamál advises, wisdom cannot be granted through mere speech or written text. It requires a deep personal experience and transformation, attained through sacrifice, pain, and steadfast determination. This is why Odin hung himself from the World Tree and refused earthly nourishment - he sought insights that could not be obtained through mundane means. Similarly, each rune symbolizes an aspect of reality, and true understanding can only be gained by a genuine connection with the roots of existence.

3. **Personal Transformation**:
To fully grasp the wisdom of the runes, one must undergo personal transformation. Odin's sacrifice exemplifies the process of self-transformation in the pursuit of knowledge. He willingly subjected himself to immense suffering, disregarding his initial state of divine power, to ultimately gain insights that would transform him into an even greater deity. Learning the runes and their meanings require more than intellectual comprehension – it demands an inner transformation connecting one's personal experience to the profound secrets of the cosmos.

In conclusion, the correlation between Odin's sacrifice at Yggdrasil and the discovery of runes is integrally connected to the concepts of cosmic balance, wisdom, and personal transformation. Odin's sacrifice demonstrates the necessity to maintain equilibrium in the cosmos and signifies the profound wisdom embedded within the runes. Additionally, to fully understand and harness the power of the runes, one must undergo personal transformation, much like Odin did. By exploring these themes, initiates and students can gain deep knowledge, not only of the runes and their meanings but of the fundamental principles governing the balance and mysteries of the universe.
