In order to delve into the intricate connection between the Akashic Records, sacred geometry, and astrology from an occultist perspective, it is essential to first understand each of these disciplines individually. Then, we will explore their connections and synergies, and outline a process that can potentially offer a glimpse into the future.

The Akashic Records represent a vast, nonphysical library that houses the collective knowledge and experiences of every soul that has ever existed. This storehouse of information, existing in the astral plane, is thought to be encoded into the very fabric of reality, allowing beings with the right access to consult it. These records are believed to contain nuggets about the past, present, and probable future of individuals and civilizations, including their thoughts, emotions, and actions. Often described as a universal filing system, the Akashic Records facilitate a deeper understanding of oneself and the surrounding world.

Sacred geometry, on the other hand, is the study of the underlying mathematical patterns, shapes, and configurations that permeate all existence. This discipline delves into the recognition and examination of geometric forms and their symbolic meanings behind the various aspects of reality - from subatomic particles and DNA structures to celestial bodies and the universe itself. Sacred geometry is believed to represent the architectural blueprint of the cosmos and holds powerful, mystical energies that can affect human consciousness and spiritual development.

Astrology is the age-old practice of examining the associations between the celestial bodies, such as planets and stars, and human existence. It posits that these celestial objects exert certain influences on individuals, societies, and events based on their positions, movements, and configurations at different points in time. Astrology seeks to study and interpret these influences to provide meaningful insights into life's various facets, including personality traits, destiny, and potential challenges.

Now that we have a fundamental understanding of the Akashic Records, sacred geometry, and astrology, let's explore the connections between these domains. It is crucial to note that these disciplines are inherently interconnected, as each possesses a profound symbology and influence on the human experience. The Akashic Records encompass all possible timelines and outcomes of reality, and astrology reveals these through the universal laws underpinning celestial phenomena, while sacred geometry illustrates the underlying energetics that orient existence.

To acquire a glimpse of the future within these interrelated disciplines, an initiate must undertake the following step-by-step process:

1. **Preparation**: Begin by cultivating an open and receptive mindset, free from preconceived notions and distractions. This creates an environment conducive to spiritual growth and access to higher realms of consciousness.

2. **Meditation**: Engage in regular meditation practices, wherein the focus is on quieting the mind, heightening awareness, and attuning to the subtle vibrations of the universe.

3. **Seek Guidance**: Consult experienced teachers, mentors, or fellow practitioners who possess knowledge in these areas; books, courses, or workshops can also provide valuable instruction.

4. **Develop Intuition**: Strengthen your intuitive faculties through practices such as divination, dream interpretation, and journaling, for these will assist in interpreting the complex symbology found within the Akashic Records, sacred geometry, and astrology.

5. **Attune to the Patterns**: Deepen your understanding of the mathematical principles and celestial cycles that govern existence by studying their subtle yet powerful manifestations.

6. **Access the Akashic Records**: With sufficient preparation and spiritual attunement, enter the Akashic Records through meditation, astral projection, or guided visualization. Once there, seek pertinent information about the future or insights relevant to your current path.

7. **Integration**: Upon gaining knowledge from these interrelated disciplines, contemplate and integrate newfound insights into your consciousness and daily life, applying them in practical, meaningful ways.

In summarizing the key themes and ideas, the Akashic Records, sacred geometry, and astrology are interrelated disciplines that offer profound and mystical insights into the fabric of existence. By understanding their interconnectedness and mastering the process outlined above, an initiate can potentially acquire a glimpse of the future, aiding their spiritual development and fostering a deeper awareness of themselves and the cosmos.
