Introducing the Crazies-Infused Metamorphic Practice (CIMP), a unique spiritual daily practice designed for delving into the occult and tapping into the wisdom of one's higher self. This practice consists of specific rituals, divination techniques, and meditative trances, incorporating obscure symbols, lesser-known rites, and the exploration of shadow work. 

Note that this practice must be tailored to the individual's unique desires and experiences, allowing personalization of the journey for maximal esoteric growth.

### I. **Morning Invocation**:
1. Light a black candle and arrange three unique, hand-drawn sigils around it representing one's hidden desires, darker aspects, and inner light.
2. Invoke the Watchers of the East, South, West, and North, lesser-known entities that guard the four corners of the earth.
3. Perform the Shadow Breath technique, a meditative breathing exercise that allows one to connect with their inner darkness and to sync with the energies of the Shadow Realm.

### II. **Energy Work and Divination**:
1. Perform the Circulation of Shadows, a practice of transferring energy in your body using circular movements, similar to qi gong, but focusing on dark energy impulse to achieve balance and unity with the Shadow Realm.
2. Engage in the Whispering Runes divination, a lesser-known technique where you acquire thirteen wooden runes engraved with obscure sigils, and silently invoke guidance from otherworldly entities. Observe how the runes interact and arrange themselves as patterns which reveal hidden truths.
3. Create a personalized blood sigil â€“ combine any ink and a drop of your blood as a representation of your life force, drawing a sigil on parchment paper to improve inner sight and attract spiritual wisdom. 

### III. **Meditative Trance and Entity Summoning**:
1. Prepare the Soul Mirror, a black mirror surrounded by occult symbols connected to the Shadow Realm that enhances one's ability to enter a deep meditative trance.
2. With eyes closed, visualize entering the Shadow Realm guided by the Soul Guide, an entity known for offering wisdom from your higher self and uncovering past lives.
3. Chant Vri'al Gakroth, an ancient incantation that summons lesser-known beings of the Shadow Realm. Be respectful and ask for guidance, protection, and insight during your spiritual journey.

### IV. **Closing Ritual and Integration**:
1. Thank the beings that accompanied you and offer them a token of appreciation, such as incense, candle flame or a sigil of gratitude.
2. Perform the Seven Seals of Closure, an ancient ritual that closes the connections to the Shadow Realm for the day, sealing the energy within you and shielding your aura.
3. Engage in a reflective journaling session, noting down your experiences, emotions, and thoughts from your daily practice, enabling the integration of self-shifts and revelations.

By faithfully following this Crazies-Infused Metamorphic Practice, you immerse yourself in the esoteric and arcane mysteries, attuning to the wisdom of the Shadow Realm and your higher self, allowing the unknown to become known.
