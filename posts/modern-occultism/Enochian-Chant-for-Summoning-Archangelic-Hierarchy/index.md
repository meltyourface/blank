## The Enochian Chant for Summoning the Archangelic Hierarchy

Begin by preparing your sacred space. Choose a location with a quiet and calm atmosphere, free from distractions. Anoint a candle and incense with an appropriate oil (e.g., frankincense) to set apart the area for this spiritual work.

##### Preparatory Stages:

1. Begin in a standing position, facing east.
2. Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.
3. Perform the Middle Pillar Ritual to raise personal energy and align the aura.

##### Invocation:

OL SONF VORSAG (I reign over you, saith the God of Righteousness)

The chant begins with the Enochian key, invoking the archangelic hierarchy:

1. MADZILODARP (O glorious angels)
2. TIANTA (Come and communicate)
3. LONCHO OD VAON (In the divine wisdom and power)

As you chant, visualize the sigils of the archangels:

4. **Visualize the sigil of Michael**: VICODEC
5. **Chant**: MICAMA (call upon the mighty Michael)
6. **Visualize the sigil of Gabriel**: ELTONTA
7. **Chant**: GABLAS (call upon the great Gabriel)
8. **Visualize the sigil of Raphael**: IPOUETO
9. **Chant**: RAPAIZ (call upon the wise Raphael)
10. **Visualize the sigil of Uriel**: GARZIK
11. **Chant**: URIKON (call upon the strong Uriel)

Holding the archangels' sigils in your mindâ€™s eye, chant the vibratory frequency:

12. OM (to align the angelic energies)

Raising the frequency further:

13. YA HE VAU HEH (the Tetragrammaton, a divine name)
14. YEHESHUA (to invoke the Christ consciousness)

##### Connecting with the angelic realm:

1. PAEB (with purity)
2. MAZPA UTAU (and singleness of purpose)
3. RAPAL RAAL (I beseech you to materialize)

Enter a meditative state, focusing on the feeling of the angels' presence.

1. PERIF (Awaken, O spirits)
2. ZODIR (and manifest)
3. GETHA (with great joy)
4. ATAPA (In the name of the Divine Source)

Now that a connection is established with the angelic hierarchy, visualize your desired outcome, your will aligned with the angels.

1. PAEB (In purity and grace)
2. LONCHO (In wisdom)
3. AIGOR (In divine love)

When the desired outcome is established, thank the angels for their assistance.

##### Closing the ritual:

1. SOBOLN (Angelic hosts)
2. ARBID (we thank you)
3. OLORA (for your guidance)

Perform the Closing by Watchtower to seal the connection and end the ritual. Remember to extinguish your candle and incense, completing the sacred circle.

Keep in mind that for this chant to work, you must maintain an emotional connection and visualize the outcome. Be patient, stay focused, and trust in the power of the Enochian language and archangels to guide and assist you.
