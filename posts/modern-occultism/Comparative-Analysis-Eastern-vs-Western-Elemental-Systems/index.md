**Analysis**

The Eastern and Western elemental systems have variations in their elements and interpretations, but also share several similarities. Both systems consider Fire, Earth, Water, and Air as the basic elements. The Eastern system includes two additional elements, Metal and Wood, representing transformation and change, while the Western system includes Aether, a spiritual or divine element.

The elemental associations with colors, directions, and periods of the year reveal a commonality in their symbolic meanings. Both systems use these elemental associations to understand the natural world, as well as to influence and manipulate energies for personal growth and magical purposes.

In terms of differences, the Chinese Five-Phases (Wu Xing) showcases a distinct cyclic interdependence and transformation between the elements, which is absent in the Western Hermetic system. The Hindu Panchabhuta system, on the other hand, is more focused on creation, destruction, and transcendence.

Understanding the similarities and differences in these elemental systems can enhance the study and practice of occultism worldwide. By integrating different systems, practitioners can develop a broader perspective on the nature of reality, allowing for more profound personal insights and powerful magical workings.
