Sure, I will provide you with an Enochian chant intended for summoning a specific hierarchy of angels. In this case, we will focus on the hierarchy of the Archangels, which are high-ranking angels within the celestial hierarchy. For this particular chant, we will incorporate authentic Enochian script, phonetic pronunciation, sigils, and vibratory frequencies in accordance with traditional invocation practices.

It is important to note that Enochian invocations typically involve complex rituals and instruments. Make sure to thoroughly familiarize yourself with Enochian magical practices before proceeding. Always approach these with great caution.

Enochian Chant:

1.- Prepare a sacred and comfortable space for your ritual. Light candles, burn incense such as frankincense, and create an atmosphere conducive to deep meditation.

2.- Meditate to enter a focused, intentional, and receptive state. Bring your awareness to the divine presence within and around you.

3.- Begin by invoking the primary Archangel sigil:

Sigil: The sigil of the Seven Archangels, which can be found as a heptagram composed of seven unique sigils representing each Archangel. Place the sigil in the center of your ritual altar.

4.- With the sigil in place, intone the following Enochian chant to call upon the Archangels and invite their presence:

Madriax graa prekre, soboln vors GANZIR

OL thil thild Romna onphcairos gep

Ol peripsol Ohorela Gegraph Veh-or PRDI

Gelch ld galsa gene prugara sobca.

Ohorela c-noqos, Ianaziel, gelch Veh-or Heptagram

5.- Focus deeply on the sigil while slowly and intentionally intoning the following vibratory frequencies to strengthen the connection to the angelic realm:

Frequency: 528 Hz â€“ The frequency of love, transformation, and miracles. This helps to attune your vibrational frequency to that of the angelic realm.

6.- Visualize the radiant energies of the Archangels entering your sacred space, enveloping you in their wisdom, protection, guidance, and love. Open yourself to receive and to communicate clearly with them.

7.- After a session of communion and connection with the Archangels, gradually close the ritual by expressing gratitude for their presence and assistance. Gently return your focus to your physical surroundings.

8.- Take some time to reflect on the experience and note any insights, practical applications, or messages received from the angels.

Remember that engaging with the angelic realm should be approached with humility, reverence, and genuine intent. Always exercise caution and respect throughout any Enochian ritual or practice.
