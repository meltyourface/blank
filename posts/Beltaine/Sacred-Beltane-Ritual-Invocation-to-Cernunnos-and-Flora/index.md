Sacred Invocation to Cernunnos and Flora:

Oh mighty Cernunnos, God of the green woods and wild places,
Horned Lord of the fields, keeper of the sacred cycles,
And Flora, Goddess of blossoms and flowers, bringer of spring,
Whose fertile touch awakens the earth from its winter slumber,
We beseech thee on this hallowed night of Beltaine, 
To guide our souls in embracing and cultivating love, passion, and spiritual connection.

By the symbols of the sacred marriage, we unite man and woman, innocence and wisdom,
Symbols of the spring, we venerate your presence with the flowing maypole and the lush wreath,
By the blaze of the Beltaine fire, its power and warmth embody your passion,
We present ye with offerings of fragrant flowers and herbs, honey and wine, 
By the songs of skylarks on maiden breaths and whispered dew upon twilight petals.

In this dance of life and love, may we seek, find and cherish those with whom our souls entwine,
Grant us the gift of deepening connections with those we hold most dear,
May our hearts be filled with love, and may that love nourish our lives,
Together, let us manifest passions strong as ancient oaks, with roots deep in sacred soil,
As the stag leaps through the forest and the meadow bursts with life,
May the wild energies of Cernunnos and Flora ignite within us the flame that illuminates and transforms,
Lead us to wondrous, profound connections that defy description,
And may our spirits be uplifted by the bountiful beauty of spring's embrace,
Gifting us with a clarity that sees beyond the tangible, into that which weaves our spirits into one.

In this sacred rite, we pledge our devotion to Cernunnos, Flora, and the waning moon,
The swirling starscape, and the chorus of nighttime croaks and sighs of life unseen,
By the gods and goddesses, sages and mystics, in keen awareness we stand,
In perfect balance of love and life, we honor your presence,
And give thanks for the divine power you bestow upon us,
Seeking your guidance and wisdom in our paths forward.

Cernunnos and Flora, grant us endless seasons of love and growth,
In a world that teems with life, may our spirits soar like eagles,
From the dawn of Beltaine to the twilight dream of eternity,
We honor you and celebrate our unity amongst the elements.

So mote it be.
