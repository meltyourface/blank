Name: Seraphine Thornweaver

Appearance: Seraphine is a tall, lithe woman with silver-white hair, consisting of delicate, finely interwoven Stinging Nettle fibers, cascading down her back. Her eyes match the deep green speckled with the occasional fine silver of Nettle fibers, revealing her deep connection to the plant. She is adorned in ornate tattoos composed of Nettle ink, gracefully wrapping her arms and body, imbuing her with Nettle's power.

Backstory: Seraphine was born under a rare celestial event known as the Viridi Eclipse in the secluded village of Nettleshire, a community thriving within the heart of an ancient, densely packed Nettlewood forest. According to village legend, children born during the Viridi Eclipse are chosen by the Moon Goddess herself and endowed with a unique connection to the Stinging Nettle, destined to wield immense mystical prowess and protect the Nettlewood's sacred heart.

Over the years, Seraphine forged a strong bond with Stinging Nettle, devouring texts, folklore, and arcane practices passed down through generations. She trained under the tutelage of Nettleshire's High Priestess, who revealed the secrets of harvesting Nettle fibers under the moonlight and crafting otherworldly Nettle artifacts. Through the study of ancient rituals and focused meditation, Seraphine unleashed Stinging Nettle's full potential within her, allowing her dominion over the plant's metaphysical properties.

Rituals: 

1. **The Ritual of Nocturnal Weaving**: Seraphine performs a moonlit dance, gracefully entwining Stinging Nettle's fibers around her body, creating an unseen armor that grants her protection and greatly enhances her agility and other physical attributes. By aligning with the lunar energies, the ritual lends a balanced feminine magic to the armor, along with lunar intuition.

2. **The Ceremony of Viridi Incantation**: Seraphine chants a forbidden language while mixing her own blood with the soil containing Nettle seeds during the new moon cycle. The integration of her life force as the catalyst causes the Stinging Nettle plants to grow extraordinarily potent and resilient. This process ensnares her magic to the Nettle's roots, leaves, and fibers. 

Magical Skills:

1. **Nettlesong**: Seraphine summons tendrils of Stinging Nettle that pulse with the rhythm of the Nettlewood's heart. She can manipulate its resonance to create a variety of effects, from lulling an enemy into a deep, toxic sleep to unleashing a sonic shockwave that propels her adversaries into a temporary state of agonizing enthrallment.

2. **Thornweaver's Lash**: Seraphine casts forth her own Nettle-fiber hair like a whip, exhibiting complete control over its flexibility and strength. She can effortlessly deliver stinging lashes to her foes, paralyzing them with the venom-laden barbs hidden within the delicate strands.

3. **Veil of Nephrite**: Seraphine invokes an illusory mist infused with the defensive power of Stinging Nettle. The veil obscures her movements, making her nearly invisible to her enemies. Its ethereal qualities can disorient those who come into contact with it, making them feel as if thousands of stinging needles are piercing their skin, causing both physical and mental anguish.

Seraphine Thornweaver, now the guardian of the Nettlewood, uses her arcane proficiency to balance the ecosphere within her domain and preserve its potent connection to the Moon Goddess. When her village is threatened, she leads the charge, deftly wielding her formidable talents to protect those who revere the Stinging Nettle's ancient secrets. Her cunning, deep understanding of the Nettle, and unwavering devotion make her an enigmatic central figure in the unfolding events of the dark fantasy world she inhabits.
