Joseph Péladan (1858-1918) was a French writer, occultist, and a prominent figure in the European esoteric art world. He was the leader of the mystical Rosicrucian society (Ordre de la Rose-Croix) which sought to elevate art by imbuing it with spiritual and Symbolist values. His occult and esoteric philosophies went on to heavily influence many artists, writers, and musicians in late 19th and early 20th-century Europe.

Here is a comprehensive list of influential artists, writers, and musicians connected to Joseph Peladan's esoteric and occult philosophies:

1. Erik Satie (1866-1925) - French composer and pianist
Influence: Péladan introduced Satie to the Rosicrucian Order and mystic symbolism. His experience with occult ideas influenced his unique compositions.
Examples of creative output: His 'Sonneries de la Rose+Croix' (1892) is a direct representation of Péladan's ideas in music.

2. Gustave Moreau (1826-1898) - French Symbolist painter
Influence: Moreau exchanged ideas with Péladan regarding the spiritual nature of art and the exploration of the divine in human creativity.
Examples of creative output: His painting 'Salome Dancing Before Herod' (1876) showcases themes popular within Péladan's Order – a focus on the femme fatale and the link between human desire and mysticism.

3. Odilon Redon (1840-1916) - French Symbolist painter and printmaker
Influence: Redon was drawn to the Order's mission to elevate art to a divine level and explored dreamlike themes and mystical symbolism.
Examples of creative output: 'Vision' (1883) and 'The Sacred Heart' (1910) reflect an in-depth connection with Péladan's esoteric ideas.

4. Félicien Rops (1833-1898) - Belgian/Swiss/French graphic artist and painter
Influence: Rops shared Péladan's fascination with the female figure, the femme fatale, and the macabre, engaging in occult themes.
Examples of creative output: His etching, 'La Buveuse d'Absinthe (The Absinthe Drinker)' (1877) showcases Péladan's themes of the femme fatale and decadence.

5. Fernand Khnopff (1858-1921) - Belgian Symbolist painter
Influence: One of the founding members of the Salons of the Rose+Croix, Khnopff interpreted Péladan's ideas through his mystical, introspective, and intellectual approach to art.
Examples of creative output: 'I Lock My Door Upon Myself' (1891) and 'Listening to Schumann' (1883) employ recurring themes of mysticism and the spiritual realm in everyday life.

6. Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) - French sculptor and artist
Influence: Due to Péladan’s esoteric ideas, Rodin's later works echo the mystic connection to the divine and unseen forces.
Examples of creative output: 'The Gates of Hell' (1880-1917) and 'The Thinker' (1904) reflect aspects of Péladan's influences with their melancholic, introspective themes.

7. Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867) - French poet and essayist
Influence: Péladan was influenced by Baudelaire's exploration of the dark and supernatural themes in literature and poetry.
Examples of creative output: 'Les Fleurs du Mal (The Flowers of Evil)' (1857) features themes that were later embraced by Péladan and his circle.

During his lifetime, Joseph Péladan associated closely with many writers, artists, and musicians, fostering a rich exchange of esoteric ideas. Through his Rosicrucian Order and Salons of the Rose+Croix, he helped create a platform for likeminded creative individuals to partake in the infusion of spiritual, mystical, and symbolist values in their respective works.
