---**Step 1**: Choosing the Totemic Beast
Before embarking on this ritual, it is essential to choose a Totemic Beast to invoke. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Thunderbird, a powerful creature representing primordial force, storms, and protection.
**Step 2**: Preparing the Ritual Space
Choose an open and quiet space, preferably outdoors, where you will not be disturbed. The ritual should be performed during a storm or when the sky is charged with electricity. Cleanse the area by burning sage or another purifying herb to rid it of negative energies.
**Step 3**: Gathering the Necessary Items
You will need the following items for the ritual:
- A piece of parchment
- A charcoal disk or incense burner
- Appropriate incense (such as cedar or sage)
- A quill or fine-tipped pen
- A compass
- A small offering, such as a feather or piece of turquoise
**Step 4**: Drawing the Sigil and Circle
Using the compass, draw a large circle to represent the presence of the Earth, the fundamental grounding element. Inside the circle, draw the sigil of the Thunderbird â€“ often depicted as a stylized bird with wings outstretched amongst lightning bolts. The sigil should be drawn with intent and focus on the traits you wish to invoke from the Thunderbird.
**Step 5**: Lighting the Incense
Place the charcoal disk or incense burner at the center of the circle and light it. Allow the incense to fill the space with its sacred scent, symbolizing the purifying and protective qualities of the Thunderbird.
**Step 6**: Sacred Chants
Begin to chant the sacred words or phrases dedicated to the Thunderbird as you seek guidance and protection. An example chant could be: 

"Ancient spirit, guardian of the storm, Thunderbird of mighty power,
Manifest before me, guide and protect me, harness the force, eternally."

Repeat the chant over and over, allowing the energy within the circle to build and intensify.
**Step 7**: Offering
Present your chosen offering to the Thunderbird, placing it at the center of the circle where the incense burns. This act symbolizes trust, openness, and gratitude for the Thunderbird's presence.
**Step 8**: Invocation
Once the atmosphere is charged and the offerings are made, call upon the Thunderbird with a strong voice, stating your intent and asking for assistance. Be specific about what you seek but remain respectful and humble.

"Ancient Thunderbird, I call upon your might,
Grant me your wisdom, power, and insight,
With reverence, I ask you to aid me,
As I navigate the storms of life, please guide me."
**Step 9**: Closing the Ritual
After feeling the presence, assistance, or acknowledgment of the Thunderbird, thank the great spirit and express gratitude for the guidance it has offered. To close the circle, walk counter-clockwise around the perimeter while chanting words of gratitude, allowing the energy to dissipate and rejoin the natural world.

**Possible Consequences**: Successfully invoking the Thunderbird may result in enhanced intuition and the ability to foresee potential challenges. The powerful presence of the Thunderbird may offer protection in both spiritual and physical realms, giving the practitioner increased confidence and surefootedness as they navigate obstacles in their life. Be aware of heightened sensitivity to imminent changes and enhanced responsibility for harnessing the force within you for the greater good.

By following these steps, the ritual will facilitate a deep connection to the Thunderbird Totemic Beast, empowering you in your spiritual journey and offering guidance through the storms of life.
