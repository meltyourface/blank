Task: Design an intricate invocation ceremony tailored to the Modern esoteric and occult practice for summoning a definitive entity.

**Chosen Entity**: Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, knowledge, and writing, associated with the moon and known as a mediator between good and evil.

**The Ritual**: The Invocation of Thoth

Supplies needed:
1. A dark, quiet, and private indoor space
2. An altar
3. A purple or indigo cloth for the altar
4. A large brass or golden plate for offerings
5. Offerings: candles, incense (frankincense and myrrh), papyrus scrolls, a quill, and ink
6. A glass or chalice of water
7. A figure or image of Thoth
8. Sigil of Thoth
9. An ankh, a symbol of life
10. A white or silver robe to wear during the ritual
11. A moonstone or clear quartz crystal
12. A black or gold marker

Step-by-step guide:

1. Setting up the altar: 
   - Select a quiet, private area for the ritual. Ensure that there will be no interruptions.
   - Place the altar in the center of the space.
   - Place the purple or indigo cloth over the altar, representing the mysteries of the cosmos and the depth of Thoth's wisdom.
   - Arrange the brass or golden plate, candles, incense, papyrus scrolls, quill, ink, glass of water, figure of Thoth, sigil, and ankh on the altar.

2. Cleansing and consecrating the space:
   - Light the candles and incense.
   - Stand before the altar, close your eyes, and visualize a sphere of white or silver light surrounding the entire space, clearing away any negative energy.
   - Open your eyes and declare, "In the name of Thoth, may this sacred space be cleansed, blessed, and protected."

3. Preparing yourself for the invocation:
   - Take a cleansing bath or shower.
   - Dress in the white or silver robe to symbolize purity of intent.
   - Hold the moonstone or clear quartz crystal in your hands, close your eyes, and take a few moments to quiet your mind and focus your intention on invoking Thoth's presence.
  
4. Opening the ritual:
   - Stand before the altar and hold the ankh in your right hand.
   - Draw the sigil of Thoth on your forehead using the black or gold marker.
   - Lightly tap the ankh three times on the ground and declare, "I invoke thee, Thoth, god of wisdom, knowledge, and writing. Come forth, and be present in this sacred space."

5. Invoking Thoth:
   - Recite the following chant slowly and with intent:
  
   "I call upon Thoth, the Divine Scribe,
    Ruler of the Moon and Master of the Tides,
    Bringer of insight, knowledge, and truth,
    Illuminate my path and guide my pursuit.

    As the moon waxes and wanes in its grace,
    Unveil the mysteries, reveal what's erased,
    With your sacred knowledge, wisdom, and power,
    Aid me in my quest, stand with me this hour."

6. Deepening the connection:
   - Spend a few moments meditating with the sigil of Thoth, focusing on the attributes and characteristics you wish to invoke and embody.
   - Inscribe your specific requests, intentions, or questions on the papyrus scrolls using the quill and ink.
   - Place the scrolls on the brass or golden plate as an offering to Thoth.

7. Consummation of the invocation:
   - Raise the glass of water, symbolizing the cosmic waters that Thoth navigates, and declare, "As the eternal scribe, you write upon the waters of existence. I offer you this water to drink and strengthen our connection."
   - Take a sip of the water, then pour the remainder over the flames of the candles, extinguishing them, signifying the end of the ritual.

8. Closing the ritual:
   - Thank Thoth for his presence and guidance and express gratitude for the connection formed during the invocation.
   - Declare, "As we part ways, I carry your wisdom and knowledge within me. So it is."
   - Use the ankh to make a final gesture, waving it in the air to complete the circle of energy.
   
9. Cleanse and depower the space:
   - Visualize the sphere of white or silver light contracting, returning to its original size, and dissipating, thereby cleansing and depowering the area.
   - Remove all items from the altar, taking care to maintain respect and reverence for the ritual space.

Remember that the success, safety, and effectiveness of this invocation ceremony are reliant on your personal commitment, intent, and the depth of your connection with Thoth. Always approach esoteric practices with respect, caution, and proper preparation.
