## The Invocation of Oculus, the Entity of Enlightened Vision

**Objective**: To summon a definitive entity, Oculus, who represents enlightened vision, clarity, and insight for the practitioner.

**Preparation**:

1. Determine the purpose: The practitioner must establish a clear intention for summoning Oculus. Common purposes include gaining insight into a specific situation, enhancing one's intuitive abilities, and obtaining knowledge of the unseen or hidden.

2. Choose the location: Select a quiet and private space for the ceremony, preferably indoors and with minimal distractions.

Materials required:

1. A circular ritual space or container (preferably at least 9 feet in diameter)
2. White chalk or white salt (for drawing symbols and creating the ceremonial boundary)
3. Incense (sandalwood or frankincense)
4. A small table or altar
5. A purple or indigo candle
6. A chalice or glass of water
7. A crystal or object representing clarity (e.g., clear quartz)
8. A written statement or parchment of intent
9. A lighter or matches

Ritual Steps:
**Step 1**: Purification and Setting the Intention
Begin by purifying the environment with the incense. Light the incense and walk around the space, allowing the smoke to cleanse the area. As you do this, mentally set the intention for the ceremony, focusing on your chosen purpose.
**Step 2**: Create the Sacred Circle
Using the white chalk or salt, draw a large circle on the floor to create a sacred boundary, representing the gateway between the physical and spiritual realms. Add a smaller circle within the larger one, creating a dual-ring pattern. Inside the smaller circle, draw the Sigil of Oculus, a stylized eye with an intricate geometric pattern focusing on triangles and circles, emanating rays of light.
**Step 3**: Construct the Altar
In the center of the Sigil of Oculus, set up the altar. Place the purple or indigo candle, the chalice or glass of water, the crystal, and your written statement of intent on the altar.
**Step 4**: Light the Candle and Invoke the Elements
Light the candle and invoke the four elementsâ€”Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Recite the following chant:

"I call upon the elements of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth
Bring balance, harmony, and power within this circle.
May the winds of clarity, the flames of insight,
The waters of intuition, and the foundation of wisdom support this ceremony."
**Step 5**: Invoke Oculus
Stand facing the altar and raise your arms. Begin chanting the Invocation of Oculus:

"Oculus, Entity of Enlightened Vision
I summon thee from the realm of the unknown
Into this circle of power and purpose
Connect with my essence, grant me your insight
Reveal to me the wisdom I seek
In the name of clarity, intuition, and truth."

Repeat the chant three times, each time with increasing intensity. Focus on the warm energy that begins to build within the circle.
**Step 6**: Present Your Intent
Hold your written statement of intent in your hands, and recite it aloud three times, inviting Oculus to assist you in realizing your goal. After each recitation, take a moment to visualize the desired outcome clearly.
**Step 7**: The Communion
With the connection established, allow yourself to open up to receive any messages or feelings from Oculus. Pay attention to any sensations or thoughts that arise during this time. Remain in this state for as long as necessary.
**Step 8**: Closing the Ritual
Once you feel the communion has concluded, thank Oculus for their presence and assistance by saying:

"Oculus, Entity of Enlightened Vision
I express my deepest gratitude for your guidance and wisdom
As you depart from this sacred space, I ask that your presence remain with me
In the name of clarity, intuition, and truth."
**Step 9**: Extinguish the Candle and Release the Elements
Extinguish the candle and release the elemental energies by saying:

"I now release the elements of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth
Go in peace and harmony, leaving your power within this space,
Blessings and gratitude for your presence."
**Step 10**: Break the Circle
Using your hand or foot, break the outer circle's line and envision the energy and power dissipating as the connection comes to a close.

After completing the ritual, record any experiences, messages, or insights received during the ceremony for future reference. Reflect on the results and adapt the ritual as necessary for future use.
