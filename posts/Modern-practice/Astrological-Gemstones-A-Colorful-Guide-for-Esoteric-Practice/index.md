Beneath each gemstone, provide a brief explanation of the energetic properties.

To add depth and nuance to the diagram, incorporate the colors and symbols associated with each sign, element, planet, and gemstone. Design a legend to ensure clarity within the diagram and provide any necessary explanations about the symbols and their meanings.
