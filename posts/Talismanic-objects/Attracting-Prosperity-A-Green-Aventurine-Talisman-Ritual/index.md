The objective of the following ritual is to imbue a talisman with the energies needed to attract prosperity and abundance. The talisman will be made from green-colored aventurine, a stone known for its powers in bringing luck and wealth.

Materials required:
1. Green aventurine - Carved into a small disk shape, around 1.5 inches in diameter.
2. Gold ink or paint - This will be used to inscribe the symbols onto the talisman.
3. A clean, white cloth to wrap the talisman during the ritual.
4. A gold or brass candle holder with a green candle - symbolizing material wealth.
5. Incense ‚Äì Myrrh, frankincense, or cinnamon preferred.
6. A wooden box lined with velvet - To store the talisman following the ritual.

Steps for the ritual:

1. Choose the ideal time for performing the ritual. The planetary alignment should be when Jupiter is strong, such as during its time of transit in Sagittarius or Pisces. The ideal lunar phase is the waxing moon, when the energies of the universe aid in attraction and growth. A Thursday is ideal for performing this ritual because it is ruled by Jupiter, and it should ideally be performed in the planetary hour of Jupiter as well.

2. Determine a calming, quiet, and clean location to perform the ritual. Set up the altar in this location, placing the white cloth at the center. Position the gold or brass candle holder with the green candle placed on the cloth. The incense burner should be to the right of the altar, with the green aventurine and gold ink or paint on the left.

3. Light the candle and incense. Clear your mind and focus on your intentions to attract wealth, abundance, and prosperity to your life. Visualize the energies of Jupiter and the universe aiding in your manifestation.

4. Take a few deep breaths and begin reciting a mantra specific to your goal such as, "Abundance and wealth, hear my call. Fill my life and overflow, great prosperity, I enthrall."

5. **Hold the aventurine in your left hand, and with your right hand, use the gold ink to inscribe the following sigil**: ùíë, which combines the astrological signatures of Jupiter ( ‚ôÉ ) and the Earth element ( ‚¥∞ ). This will connect the power of Jupiter to your talisman, aiding in the manifestation of material wealth.

6. Once you have inscribed the symbol, wrap the talisman in the white cloth. Hold the bundle in both hands, close your eyes, and visualize a golden aura surrounding the talisman, imbuing it with the energies of wealth, abundance, and prosperity.

7. When you feel that the talisman has been fully charged, gently blow out the candle and allow the incense to burn out on its own.

8. Carefully place the talisman within the velvet-lined wooden box. This will help maintain a pure environment for the energies to remain strong.

Store the talisman in a safe and sacred space, such as a personal altar or a hidden compartment in your home. Carry it with you when seeking new opportunities, negotiating, or making financial decisions. Regularly cleanse and recharge the talisman using the same ritual to maintain its potency over time.
