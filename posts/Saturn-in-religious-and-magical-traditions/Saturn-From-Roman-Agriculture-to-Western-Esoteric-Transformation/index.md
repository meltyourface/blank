In response to the knowledge challenge, let us begin by examining the role of Saturn in ancient Roman religion and its relation to time, death, and transformation. Afterward, we will compare and contrast this role to its prominence in modern Western esotericism, delving into the similarities, differences, and possible reasons for such changes.

**Saturn in Ancient Roman Religion**: 

In ancient Roman religion, Saturn was one of the earliest gods, originally associated with agriculture, harvest, and abundance. This association is evident in the name "Saturn," which is derived from the Latin term "saturo," meaning "to sow." Saturn is perhaps best known for his festival, Saturnalia, occurring between December 17 and 23. This was a time of revelry, gift-giving, and role reversal to celebrate the harvest and the end of the year.

Saturn's prominence was not limited to agriculture, however. Over time, he became identified with the Greek god Cronus, the father of Zeus, and son of Uranus. This Hellenistic influence led to the Roman Saturn acquiring attributes related to time and mortality. As a god of cycles and regenerative transformation, Saturn also represented the inevitable decay and eventual rebirth of systems and periods.

In addition to controlling the passage and cycles of time, Saturn was perceived as a harvester of souls, collecting and dissolving them back into primordial chaos. The motif of the scythe, associated with harvesting the crops, reinforced this relationship to time and death.

**Saturn in Modern Western Esotericism**: 

In modern Western esotericism, Saturn retains its association with time, death, and transformation. However, its prominence has shifted to encompass more philosophical, psychological, and astrological aspects. It often symbolizes a process of spiritual maturation and the ideal of transcending the limits of mortality, particularly in alchemy, esoteric astrology, and ceremonial magic.

Perhaps the most significant symbolic change is the astrological attributions of Saturn. It is traditionally linked to the restrictions, boundaries, and harsh lessons we encounter in life. The planet's association with time remains consistent, now symbolizing limitations, karma, and enduring challenges. Most people associate Saturn with its return, the approximately 29.5-year cycle, when it returns to its position in the sky at the time of an individual's birth. Saturn Returns are seen as periods of crises, rebirth, and transformation in one's life journey.

Furthermore, in the Western esoteric tradition, Saturn often represents the shadow self, the dark, hidden, and more profound aspects of one's personality. It is associated with the process of introspection and the embrace of limitations in order to facilitate spiritual growth.

Comparison and Contrast:

1. **Time**: In both ancient Roman religion and modern Western esotericism, Saturn is significantly linked with time, cycles, and transformation. However, ancient Romans focused more on natural cycles, such as seasons, agriculture, and physical regeneration, while modern Western esotericism addresses psychological, spiritual, and astrological cycles.

2. **Death**: In both contexts, Saturn is inextricably intertwined with death. In ancient Roman religion, Saturn acts primarily as a harvester of souls, whereas modern Western esotericism emphasizes Saturn's connection to karmic debt and life challenges as a means of spiritual evolution.

3. **Transformation**: Transcendent experiences and personal and collective regeneration are associated with Saturn in both Roman and Western esoteric thought. However, Roman religion exhibits a more external and community-based approach, emphasized by the Saturnalia festivities, while modern esotericism highlights the individual's internal spiritual progress.

In conclusion, the role of Saturn in ancient Roman religion and modern Western esotericism reveals both similarities and differences in relation to time, death, and transformation. While the former is focused on agricultural cycles, personal rebirth, and communal engagement, the latter emphasizes internal spiritual growth, the ideal of transcending mortal limitations, and harnessing such forces for personal evolution. The shifts in Saturn's associations over time reflect cultural, social, and psychological changes, alluding to the true power of Saturn as a symbol capable of adaptation and resilience.
