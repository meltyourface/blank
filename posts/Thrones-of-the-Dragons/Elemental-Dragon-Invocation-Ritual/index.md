excerpt: Design a comprehensive ritual containing individual incantations for forming a mystical alliance with each of the five key Elemental Dragons of the Thrones of the Dragons realm, respectively embodying the powers of Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Spirit. Each invocation must include a unique, poetic chant that showcases the essence of the specific elemental dragon, a corresponding physical gesture that strengthens the connection, and a symbolic offering designed to gain their respect and loyalty. Additionally, incorporate historical references and mythical lore relevant to each Elemental Dragon to enrich the overall experience of the ritual.

## Alliance of the Elemental Draconic Thrones

### I. Unveiling the Five Thrones
Begin by preparing the ritual space in a quiet, secluded area where you can concentrate and connect with your inner self. Sweep the floor, and trace a circle with salt around your working area to bring balance and insulation. Light five colored candles in the colors that represent the elements: red for fire, blue for water, green for earth, yellow for air, and white for spirit.

### II. Call to the Elemental Dragons of the Thrones Realm

1. Invocation of the Fire Dragon - Pyrovaine, Incarnation of Blaze and Passion

Chant:
"Blazing Pyrovaine, thy flames inspire,
Ignite within me, thy passion, your fire.
From the very core, I connect with thy soul,
Divine alliance, thy wisdom unfolds."

**Gesture**: Raise hands above head, palms facing each other, forming a peak, symbolizing flames reaching skyward.

**Offering**: Burn intricately designed recipes of ambition and mastery, allowing the smoke to rise and call forth the presence of Pyrovaine.

**Mythical lore**: As the old saga tells, Pyrovaine, with a fiery heart, has shaped history, granting legendary blacksmiths inspiration and guidance in forging legendary weapons imbued with invincible power.

2. Invocation of the Water Dragon - Ocealagan, Embodiment of Flow and Emotion

Chant:
"Ocealagan, dear abyssal sovereign,
Wave after wave, our bond is fastening.
From the deepest oceans, you emerge with grace,
In your presence, we're one, divine and great."

**Gesture**: Move hands fluid and softly in horizontal, wave-like motions symbolizing the free-flowing energy of the tides.

**Offering**: Pour a chalice of pure, sacred water into a ceremonial bowl while reflecting on fluidity, transformation, and connection.

**Mythical lore**: Folktales speak of Ocealagan blessing sailors with safe journeys, leading to great undiscovered lands and fathomless buried treasures.

3. Invocation of the Earth Dragon - Terragrath, Pillar of Stability and Abundance

Chant:
"Terragrath, mighty ancient of the ground,
Your quaking presence brings us fertile ground.
With the force of Earth, with you, we stand tall,
An alliance formed, transpires beyond all."

**Gesture**: Firmly plant both feet on the ground, palms facing down, feeling the vibrations of the Earth beneath.

**Offering**: Bury precious gemstones, seeds and coins in a small vessel, symbolizing the power of growth and treasures found within the Earth.

**Mythical lore**: Terragrath, as legends unfold, was once responsible for creating the majestic mountain ranges that provide shelter, prosperity, and life to countless creatures and civilizations.

4. Invocation of the Air Dragon - Zephyreth, Whisperer of Knowledge and Freedom

Chant:
"Zephyreth, breathe into me the wind's song,
As ancient as time, enlighten my core.
Our spirits rejoice, bear wings and astral flight,
With you, wisdom's secrets unveil the night."

**Gesture**: Spread arms wide, with fingers as feather quills, turn and face each direction, embracing the unseen wind.

**Offering**: Release an aged parchment of knowledge into the air, allowing it to be caught by the wind currents and carried away.

**Mythical lore**: Zephyreth has long guided sages, philosophers and wanderers, offering insight gained through conversations with ancestors and the whispers of the ever-changing winds.

5. Invocation of the Spirit Dragon - Aetherion, Weaver of Destiny and Essence

Chant:
"Aetherion, the cosmos you transcend,
Embrace our alliance, time and dimensions bend.
Unseen connections of spirit emerge,
In unity, our destinies converge."

**Gesture**: Stand straight with palms pressed together, near the heart and close your eyes, envisioning the infinite stars and constellations connecting to your soul.

**Offering**: Ignite a smudge stick of sacred herbs, allowing the cleansing smoke to wrap around you and awaken spiritual connection.

**Mythical lore**: Aetherion weaves fate and transcends time, carefully watching over the mortal world and its denizens, observing as intricate webs of destiny unfold, guiding those who seek spiritual ascension along their destined paths.

### III. Sealing the Union

With all Elemental Dragons now manifest, speak aloud the following:

"By the ancient powers, we are united,
In this sacred bond, infused and ignited.
To each Element, our alliance pristine,
Revered Elemental Dragons of the Thrones, so shall it be!"

Conclude the ritual by extinguishing the candles in reverse order from the summoning (spirit, air, earth, water, fire). Finally, close the circle and ground yourself, sharing gratitude for this newfound union.
