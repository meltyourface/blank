Upon the stage of twilight's sultry glance,
Two lovers' shadows dance like fire's embrace,
Each silken touch does spark a fateful trance,
In heat of passion's grip, their hearts give chase.

Their supple forms do weave in scorching flame,
And tongues like serpents tempt the gilded gates,
Both souls aflame, they whisper each one's name,
Bound tight by lustful threads, desire dictates.

As carnal rain does quench their burning yearn,
They taste ambrosia, sweet as summer's bloom,
A ravenous feast wherein their bodies churn,
Until resplendent dawn unveils the room.

United in embrace, they soar above,
In ecstasies of passion, caught by love.
