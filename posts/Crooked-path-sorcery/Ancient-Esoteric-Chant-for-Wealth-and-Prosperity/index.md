excerpt: >
  1. Invoke a mythic patron or deity known for their association with prosperity and abundance, such as Fortuna or Freyja, by incorporating their names and epithets within the incantation.

  2. Detail the required ritual components and offerings, like rare herbs, enchanted talismans, or blood sacrifices, that will effectively bind the invoked forces to your intent for magnified results.

  3. Incorporate the obscure phases of the moon or planetary alignments that may enhance the potency of the spell, referencing celestial events such as the convergence of Jupiter and Venus.

  4. Intertwine an enchanting melody or cadence into the spell, as an additional layer of summoning the desired energies and ensuring their unwavering focus upon your objective.

By the twisted threads and unseen paths I weave,
In the name of Fortuna, Goddess of Chance, I bid thee a boon,
And Freyja, Vanir of Wealth and Bounty, I seek thy radiance,
Accept my humble incantation, my offering made true,
May my plea be heard through realms afar, obscure and vast.

Upon this sacred altar, ablaze with the coals of mystery,
I lay rare zunduk herbs, whispering the language of riches,
And aeon-old talismans of an eon-forgotten rune,
Blood of a falcon, noble and swift, to bind these ancient forces.

Their potency magnified, I await the celestial convergence of spheres,
As Jupiter lies in dalliance with Venus, prosperous union unparalleled,
Moon in the phase of an argent crescent, waxing with promises,
Upon such a night, when cosmos align, let my incantation take flight.

Now in serenade, I chant a melody, entrancing, harmonious,
An ageless hymn to summon vast, abundant energies,
In fugue with this enchanting cadence, their focus set upon my desires,
The heavens resounding, mine astral song revered.

I summon forth prosperity, in forms varied and manifold,
May my coffers brim and overflow with glittering gold,
And the fields yon, laden with harvests lush and bountiful,
Trading connections far and wide, flourish and grow, all obstacles quelled.

With this incantation of the Esoteric Crooked Path,
I bind these ancient powers, may their gifts be granted,
Fortuna and Freyja, I stand in your service, my devotion unwavered,
In your names, I seek, and thus, shall find: wealth, affluence, and abundance.
