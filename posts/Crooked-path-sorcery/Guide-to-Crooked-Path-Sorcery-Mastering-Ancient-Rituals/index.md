From sacred lands of the Egyptians to the dark groves of the Druids and the enigmatic rituals of the Native American shamans, Crooked Path Sorcery is a synthesis of arcane knowledge that transcends boundaries of culture and time. 

Over the centuries, numerous secret societies have studied and incorporated this powerful tradition into their practices, including the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Ordo Templi Orientis, and the lesser-known Shadowborn Covenant. These organizations revered the Crooked Path for its ability to penetrate the veil between the physical realm and the world of spirits, gods, and ancient ones.

Core Concepts

1. Balance of Power: Crooked Path Sorcery recognizes both the light and dark aspects of existence, and adherents seek to balance these forces to achieve mastery over themselves and the unseen realm. A successful sorcerer does not fear the darkness but embraces and learns from it.

2. Knowledge and Wisdom: The acquisition of knowledge, combined with the intuitive understanding of how to apply it, is the foundation of Crooked Path Sorcery. Studying under experienced mentors, the dedicated practitioner gradually ascends the echelons of mastery, unearthing the secrets of the universe.
