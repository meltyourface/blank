To craft an intricate rite following the principles of the HeptameronQliphothic Grimoire, with the primary objective of invoking the seven planetary angels - Michael, Anael, Raphael, Gabriel, Samael, Zadkiel, and Cassiel - begin by preparing yourself and the ritual space.

1. Purify yourself with a ritual bath, while meditating on the energies of the planetary angels. Dress in clean, preferably white, robes.

2. Prepare the ritual space by cleansing it with sage or other purifying incense.

3. **Choose an astrologically auspicious moment to perform the rite**: ideally, when the sun, moon, and planets are in harmonious alignment with their respective angelic presences.

4. Construct a ritual circle (approximately 9-feet in diameter) using consecrated salt, and draw seven smaller circles within the circle to represent the seven planetary realms.

5. Create sigils for each angel, placing them in their corresponding circle according to the planetary associations:

- Michael: Sun, associated with gold, and the scent of frankincense
- Anael: Venus, associated with green or copper, and the scent of myrtle
- Raphael: Mercury, associated with orange, and the scent of storax
- Gabriel: Moon, associated with silver, and the scent of jasmine
- Samael: Mars, associated with red, and the scent of cinnamon
- Zadkiel: Jupiter, associated with blue, and the scent of cedar
- Cassiel: Saturn, associated with black, and the scent of aloeswood

6. **Light candles in their respective colors**: gold for Michael, green for Anael, orange for Raphael, silver for Gabriel, red for Samael, blue for Zadkiel, and black for Cassiel. Arrange these candles around the central altar, surrounded by their respective incense.

7. **Place ritual tools upon the central altar**: a chalice with water, a paten with bread, a dagger, and an incense burner.

8. Stand within the central circle, facing east, and begin the ritual by invoking the Divine Name:

"By the authority of the divine name [divine name], I humbly invoke the presence and guidance of the seven planetary angels, for the purposes of wisdom, understanding, and alignment with the greater currents of creation and existence."

9. Individually invoke each angel, using the corresponding planetary sigil as a focal point:

- "[Heptameron prayer for the appropriate day, focused on the appropriate angel] I call upon and invoke [angel's name], ruler of [planet], mighty and beneficent angelic presence. Please be with me now."

10. Visualize each angel appearing in their respective circle as the ritual proceeds. Maintain a reverent and respectful demeanor, feeling their energies gathering within the ritual space.

11. Once you sense their presence, petition the angels to bestow their blessings upon you:

"Powerful and mighty angels, I thank you for your presence and guidance. I seek your blessings, protection, and wisdom for myself and those around me. May the knowledge and strength you share elevate me and reveal my true purpose."

12. Spend time meditating on their energies and contemplate any messages you might receive.

13. Thank the seven planetary angels for their presence and support, allowing them permission to depart:

"Thank you, [angel's name], for your presence and assistance. I release you to return to your domain, may your divine light continue to guide and illuminate my path."

14. Close the ritual by banishing any lingering energies using the preferred HeptameronQliphothic Grimoire method.

15. Carefully extinguish the ceremonial candles and clean the ritual space.

Through the performance of this intricate rite, you align yourself with the celestial energies of the angels, invoking their power and wisdom to attain a higher plane of spiritual understanding and enlightenment.
