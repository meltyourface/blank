description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Sibly, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a Sibly-based sacred geometry pattern that incorporates the four mystical elements - earth, wind, fire, and water - by utilizing intricate symbolism and divine ratios. Employ the principles of Sibly to establish a harmonic connection with the celestial bodies, while referencing the renowned Hexagram of Solomon, Metatron's Cube, and Flower of Life patterns. Create a distinctive design that embodies sacred wisdom and fosters spiritual enlightenment within all who encounter it.

To create a Sibly-based sacred geometry pattern that incorporates the four mystical elements and establishes a harmonic connection with the celestial bodies, I will use the Hexagram of Solomon, Metatron's Cube, and Flower of Life as primary references and integrate them into the design. **Here's a detailed description of the overarching pattern and symbols involved**:

1. ****Foundation Layer****: The Hexagram of Solomon, also known as the Star of David, will serve as our foundation layer, representing the balance of dualities and divine connections. This six-pointed star will be placed at the center of the design.

2. ****Elemental Layer****: To represent the four mystical elements, I will encircle the Hexagram of Solomon with distinct symbols that correlate to earth, wind, fire, and water. 

- Earth: A green equilateral triangle placed at the lower-left corner of the hexagram. The triangle will be pointing upwards with a small horizontal line drawn across the midpoint of its upward edge.
- Wind: A yellow equilateral triangle placed at the upper-left corner of the hexagram. The triangle will be pointing downwards with a small horizontal line drawn across the midpoint of its downward edge.
- Fire: A red equilateral triangle placed at the lower-right corner of the hexagram. The triangle will be pointing upwards.
- Water: A blue equilateral triangle placed at the upper-right corner of the hexagram. The triangle will be pointing downwards.

3. ****Celestial Layer****: Following the principles of Sibly, we will draw lines connecting the triangles representing the elements to form a square. This square symbolizes the celestial bodies and their relationships with the elements.

4. ****Central Focus****: Inside the Hexagram of Solomon, we will place Metatron's Cube symbol. This will emphasize balance, divine power, and sacred wisdom.

5. ****Outer Layer****: Surrounding the entire design will be the Flower of Life pattern, representing unity, interconnectedness, and creation. This pattern will ultimately enhance the spiritual enlightenment evoked by the design.

6. ****Divine Ratios****: Throughout the composition of the design, we will utilize the Golden Ratio (Phi = 1.6180339887) to maintain harmony and balance within the structure. The distances between symbolic elements will adhere to this ratio, while the size proportions of each symbol will also follow this divine rule.

This resulting sacred geometry pattern will balance the mystical elements, connect with celestial bodies, and radiate divine wisdom from its symbols. Through its gracefully integrated design, it will inspire spiritual enlightenment in all who encounter it.
