To adapt the ancient Goetic summoning ritual for the 12th spirit, Sitri, from the Lesser Key of Solomon, we can begin by understanding the original ritual components, incantations, and sigils. We will then integrate the principles of the Web of Life, creating a unique summoning ritual that connects this ancient entity to the contemporary world.

[Note: This is a fictional exercise and not intended for actual use.]

Ritual Components:

1. Consecrated space: Choose a natural setting resonating with the Web of Life - a spot with trees, plants, water, or any other element representing the interconnectedness of life forms.

2. Circle of Protection: Instead of a classical chalk-drawn circle, utilize natural materials such as leaves, branches, or stones to create an organic circle.

3. Sigil: Translate Sitri's original sigil into a modern form by incorporating the Web of Life's principles. Stencil the emblem on a reusable, eco-friendly material, such as wood, instead of traditional parchment.

4. The vessel: Harness natural elements such as water, fire, earth, and air as activation points for Sitri's manifestation. Place these items equidistant around the circle.

5. Offerings: Instead of traditional offerings, provide something that will enhance the local ecosystem, such as native seeds, compost, or sustainably harvested herbs.

**Incantations**:

Translate the original Latin incantation into a contemporary language, while maintaining the essence of the summoning. 

Original incantation:

"Venite, Sitri, o potens dux inferorum, ego invoco te et coniuro! Ad me venias, e naturalibus tuis rebus surgens, meio conspectu manifestus esto!"

Contemporary incantation:

"Come, Sitri, powerful ruler of the unseen, I call upon and conjure thee! Rise from the interconnected natural world and reveal yourself within my sight!"

Ritual Process:

1. Begin by traversing the selected location, acknowledging and appreciating the interconnectedness of the Web of Life.

2. Construct the natural Circle of Protection, feeling the energetic bond between you, the earth, and all living things.

3. Place Sitri's eco-friendly sigil in the circle's center, allowing it to soak in the energy of the space. Position the elemental vessels around the Circle of Protection.

4. Stand at the circle's threshold and recite the contemporary incantation to summon Sitri. Allow the four elements to interweave, thus manifesting Sitri.

5. Once Sitri has appeared, engage in dialogue, focusing on areas of life where the principles of interconnectedness and balance are essential.

6. State your offerings and how they support the local ecosystem. In doing so, you acknowledge that the fulfillment of your desires mustn't compromise the broader Web of Life.

7. Upon finishing your exchange with Sitri, express gratitude and respectfully bid farewell. Slowly dismantle the Circle of Protection, reaffirming the connection to the Web of Life.

In summary, we have integrated the ancient Goetic summoning ritual with the modern ecological ideas of the Web of Life. These adaptations harmonize the two concepts and create a unique summoning ritual to bridge the gap between ancient and contemporary practices. Remember, this exercise is purely fictional and not intended as a guide for actual use.
