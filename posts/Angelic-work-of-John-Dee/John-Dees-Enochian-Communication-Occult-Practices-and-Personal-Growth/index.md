**Lesson: The Angelic Work of John Dee - Enochian Communication and its Application in Occult Practices**

**I. Introduction to the Angelic Work of John Dee and Enochian System**

John Dee (1527-1608) was an English mathematician, astrologer, and philosopher, who devoted a great deal of his life to the study of the esoteric and the occult. A key aspect of his work revolved around the Enochian system of communication, which he believed allowed direct interaction with angelic beings. Dee, through the assistance of his scryer, Edward Kelley, developed a complex set of symbols, language, and processes designed to facilitate communication with these divine beings and access their guidance and wisdom.

**II. Enochian Language: The Divine Speech**

Enochian is considered by many to be the language of the angels, and it plays a crucial role in the Enochian system of communication. This language is said to have been transmitted to John Dee and Edward Kelley by angelic beings during a series of complex scrying sessions between 1582 and 1587. The language is composed of 21 letters, each with its own unique and intricate symbol. According to Dee's works, the Enochian language contains the essential vibrational frequencies that resonate with the divine and allow practitioners to tap into the fundamental forces of the universe.

**III. Enochian System of Communication**

The Enochian system of communication employs a variety of techniques and tools to facilitate angelic interaction:

1. Enochian Calls: A series of 19 incantations or prayers, transmitted to Dee and Kelley by the angels. These calls serve as invocations and are used to open gateways into the realms of angelic beings. By reciting specific Enochian Calls, practitioners can align their consciousness with the corresponding angelic energies.

2. Enochian Magic Squares: Dee and Kelley were given a set of complex magical squares with sigils and letters of the Enochian alphabet. These squares are believed to represent angelic orders and hierarchies, and they serve as a basis for the Enochian magical workings. By creating specific combinations of symbols on the squares, practitioners can derive specific angelic names and access their associated powers.

3. Scrying and Crystal Gazing: In order to receive messages from the angels, John Dee employed the method of scrying. This practice involves gazing into a reflective or translucent surface, such as a polished mirror or crystal ball, to receive visions and insights from the realms beyond. The scryer, such as Edward Kelley, would enter a trance state and narrate their visions to Dee, who would then interpret the messages.

**IV. The Role of Edward Kelley**

Edward Kelley (1555-1597) was an English mystic and scryer who played a crucial role in the development of the Enochian system. As Dee's close collaborator, Kelley was responsible for receiving and transcribing the communications from the angelic beings. Dee and Kelley's partnership lasted for several years, during which time they were purported to have contacted various orders of angelic entities and received extensive knowledge on the Enochian language and its associated magical practices.

**V. Application of Enochian Magic in Personal Growth and Spiritual Development**

Enochian magic has had a significant impact on the world of occult practices and continues to be widely studied and utilized by modern-day practitioners. Its core principles can be incorporated into personal growth and spiritual development in several ways:

1. Developing Intuition and Psychic Abilities: Through the practice of scrying and meditation on the Enochian Calls, individuals can attune themselves to the vibrational frequencies of the angelic realms, thereby enhancing their intuition and psychic abilities.

2. Aligning with Higher Consciousness: By working with the Enochian language and the associated magical symbols, practitioners can open their minds to higher states of consciousness. This alignment can lead to a deeper understanding of one's purpose in life and a greater sense of spiritual connection with the divine.

3. Manifestation and Transformation: Enochian magic empowers individuals to harness the energies of the angelic realms, which can then be applied to facilitate personal growth and transformation. By invoking the presence and guidance of angelic beings, practitioners can manifest their desires and affect positive change in their lives.

In conclusion, the angelic work of John Dee, particularly the Enochian system of communication, has been a cornerstone of Western esotericism. By understanding and incorporating these principles, modern practitioners can effectively harness Enochian magic for their own spiritual growth and personal development.
