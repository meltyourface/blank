Answer: Enochian was a language that the angels taught Dee and Kelley to facilitate a deeper understanding of celestial knowledge.

**Explanation**: John Dee, a 16th-century English mathematician, astrologer, and occultist, along with his medium, Edward Kelley, worked together to contact angelic entities through the process of scrying. Scrying refers to a technique in which an individual gazes into a reflective or translucent medium, such as a crystal ball or a mirror, to gain inspiration, insight, or information.

During their scrying sessions with these angelic entities, Dee and Kelley were reportedly taught a complex system of communication, which came to be known as the Enochian language. This language is named after the biblical figure Enoch – the great-grandfather of Noah – who is said to have walked with God and been taken into heaven without experiencing physical death. 

The Enochian system of communication is composed of an alphabet of 21 letters, as well as a syntax and grammar. The angels communicated a series of texts, known as the Enochian Calls or Keys, to Dee and Kelley. These texts were said to contain powerful incantations and secrets that could yield a deeper understanding of celestial knowledge. Some occultists believe that the Enochian language is the original language spoken by angels and is the basis of the languages of creation.

The Enochian system has since played a significant role in the practice of Western occultism, with figures such as Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Aleister Crowley exploring and incorporating Enochian concepts into their work. The system has also been utilized in various magical practices, from elaborate ceremonial magic to simplified forms of modern chaos magick.

It is important to note that the Enochian system of communication goes beyond just the language itself. Dee and Kelley also received instructions on constructing various tools, such as tablets, rings, and talismans, which are said to possess magical properties and aid in contacting and accessing angelic realms.

In conclusion, the relationship between the Enochian system and the entities Dee and Kelley were contacting is that the Enochian language and its elements were supposedly revealed to them by angelic beings in order to gain greater insight into celestial knowledge and magical wisdom.
