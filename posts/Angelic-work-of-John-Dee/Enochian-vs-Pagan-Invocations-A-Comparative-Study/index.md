Enochian Callings in the Angelic Work of John Dee

John Dee, the renowned Elizabethan mathematician, astronomer, and occultist, with the help of his medium Edward Kelley, is known for creating Enochian callings or invocations. Enochian is considered the language of angels, and Dee believed using it would allow him to communicate directly with angelic beings. The Enochian system comprises 19 callings, known as keys or "claves angelicae," which are used to address various hierarchical angelic orders and deliver the divine message of God.

Traditional Pagan Invocations

Paganism, on the other hand, is an umbrella term for various pre-Christian religious and spiritual practices. Pagans typically hold polytheistic beliefs, invoking various gods, goddesses, and elemental forces depending on the specific tradition or path. Pagan invocations may be used in ritualistic contexts, such as during the celebration of sabbats or esbats. The invocations are typically designed to build a relationship between the practitioner and the deity or elemental being, drawing them closer and seeking guidance and assistance.

Structural Comparison

Enochian callings are highly structured, employing a script-like syntax. Each Enochian key has a specific purpose and adheres to an intricate hierarchy mapped out in John Dee's work on Angelic Magick. The invocations typically begin by addressing the angelic order or hierarchy, followed by requesting assistance or guidance. It also emphasizes the divine authority of the practitioner, asserting power and control over the invoked spiritual entity.

In contrast, pagan invocations are often freer in form, although many traditions have standard prayers or invocations that follow a loose structure. They may begin by acknowledging the deity or force being invoked, describing their characteristics and qualities, and then requesting their guidance, wisdom, or other forms of divine assistance. It is not uncommon for pagan invocations also to include an offering or sacrifice in exchange for the deity's aid.

Comparisons in Language and Purpose

Enochian callings utilize the Enochian language, which is unique and distinct from natural languages. It adds an air of mystery, depth, and authority to the invocations while also maintaining the belief that using the angels' language yields more direct and profound communication with them. The primary purpose of Enochian callings is to interact with celestial beings for spiritual revelation, enlightenment, and divine wisdom.

Pagan invocations employ various languages, depending on the practitioner's particular tradition and culture. While many Pagans today use their native languages, they may also incorporate ancient languages, such as Old Norse or Old Irish, to remain connected to their ancestral heritage and traditional practices. The purpose of pagan invocations may vary significantly, ranging from seeking personal guidance or knowledge to requesting assistance with everyday concerns, such as health, abundance, or protection.

Entities Invoked and Historical Context

Enochian callings primarily invoke celestial beings and orders within a complex, hierarchical system, including entities such as archangels, angels, and godlike beings. Their sole focus remains on the divine, transcendent, and celestial forces, considering them the highest source of spiritual wisdom and knowledge.

Pagan invocations summon a broad range of entities, including gods and goddesses from various pantheons, nature spirits, elemental forces, and ancestors. Pagan practitioners recognize and honor the divine in both celestial and terrestrial forms, acknowledging that all nature holds sacred wisdom worthy of exploration and reverence.

The Enochian system is deeply rooted in the Elizabethan era (16th century), a time when the intersection between science, religion, and the occult was prevalent. Meanwhile, Pagan invocations have diverse origins, often predating Christianity and arising from indigenous spiritual practices. They attempt to maintain connections to ancient wisdom and practices by harnessing spiritual forces throughout history.

Conclusion

Both Enochian callings and Pagan invocations represent unique systems of communication with spiritual entities. While they share the goal of connecting with the divine for guidance and wisdom, significant differences arise in their structure, language, and the variety of beings invoked. Furthermore, their historical and ritualistic contexts contrast significantly, revealing the intricate diversity in spiritual practices throughout human history.
