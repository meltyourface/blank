The correct answer is:
- Studying the Hermetic arts, partnering with Edward Kelley, receiving "angelic" communications, and writing Monas Hieroglyphica

John Dee (1527–1608), an English mathematician, astronomer, and influential early modern occultist, is often associated with his work on the Enochian magical system. To better understand the chronology of events leading to the development of Enochian magic, let's provide some historical context.

Dee was initially involved in the study of the Hermetic arts, which encompassed various perspectives on magic, alchemy, philosophy, and spiritual transformations through the writings attributed to the mythical figure Hermes Trismegistus. Hermeticism had a profound influence on Dee, and his studies laid the foundation for his pursuit of angelic communication and collaborations with other occultists.

Edward Kelley was an English occultist who partnered with John Dee after meeting him in 1582. Kelley possessed alleged clairvoyant abilities, which appealed to Dee's quest for celestial communication. Kelley played the role of medium—the so-called "scryer"—enabling Dee to engage in conversations with angels through Kelley's visions.

It is during their partnership, that the duo started receiving "angelic" communications. These communications ultimately led to the creation of the Enochian magical system, which encompassed Celestial metaphysics, an "angelic" language (Enochian), and a series of ethereal visions that contributed to an evolving magical tradition.

Finally, Dee wrote Monas Hieroglyphica in 1564, a treatise on symbolic language that represented the unity of all things. Although not explicitly connected to Enochian magic, it highlights Dee's fascination with symbolism, mystical language, and spiritual enlightenment.

In summary, John Dee's journey in developing the Enochian magical system began with his Hermetic studies, continued with his partnership with Edward Kelley, led to receiving "angelic" communications, and culminated with the writing of Monas Hieroglyphica.
