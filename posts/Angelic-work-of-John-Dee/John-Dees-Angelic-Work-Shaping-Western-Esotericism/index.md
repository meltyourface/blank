To fully answer this question, we must first dive into the world of John Dee, a prominent mathematician, astronomer, occult philosopher, and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century. Dee's work in the esoteric arts, including his engagement with angels and the creation of the Enochian language, was groundbreaking and has had a long-lasting impact on the Western esoteric tradition.

To begin the analysis, let's look at the angelic hierarchy in John Dee's angelic work. Influenced by the works of Pseudo-Dionysius, a 5th-century theologian, Dee believed in a hierarchical cosmology that consisted of multiple levels, with divine beings on different planes of existence. The angelic hierarchy is divided into three triads, each triad containing three orders. The first triad complements Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; the second triad is composed of Dominations, Virtues, and Powers; and the third triad contains Principalities, Archangels, and Angels.

In the context of Dee's scrying sessions, the roles of these angels were dynamic and unique. Scrying refers to the practice of gazing into a polished surface, such as a mirror or crystal ball, to communicate with otherworldly beings. Working with his scryer, Edward Kelley, Dee communicated with angels not only for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge and wisdom, but also to gain divine guidance in politics, warfare, and diplomacy.

Dee's personal beliefs played a significant role in shaping his interactions with angels. As a devout Christian, Dee viewed such communications with angels as a way to access divine knowledge while remaining loyal to his faith. This obsession with the acquisition of divine knowledge inspired the creation of the Enochian language, a system of communication with angels purportedly dictated to Dee and Kelley by the angels themselves during their scrying sessions.

Dee believed that the angels' revelations held the key to understanding the universe, establishing a bridge between humanity and the divine. This notion of acquiring knowledge directly from celestial beings has had a significant impact on the evolution of Western esotericism.

The long-lasting effects and implications of Dee's angelic interactions in Western esotericism become apparent when examining how they influenced later mystics and occultists. The concepts of angelic language and scrying continued to evolve through the work of figures such as A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, and Israel Regardie. The Enochian magical system, in particular, became a foundational element of modern Western magical systems like the Golden Dawn and Thelema.

It's evident that John Dee's angelic work intertwined the divine and academiaâ€”a fitting combination for an individual who played such a prominent role in multiple fields of research. Dee's hierarchical understanding of angels, their complex interactions with his personal beliefs, and the transcendental nature of the Enochian language have contributed significantly to the evolution of Western esotericism.

In conclusion, the long-lasting implications of Dee's work became apparent when considering their influence on later mystics and occultists. His Enochian language removed the barriers between humans and the divine, promoting the belief that knowledge could be acquired directly from celestial beings. This shifted the trajectory of Western esotericism, paving the way for future mystical systems such as the Golden Dawn and Thelema.
