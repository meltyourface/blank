Use sacred language, numerology, or symbolism with a strong historical and spiritual significance, including the incorporation of divine beings known for their protection abilities, in the mantra.

I present to you the Gavasti Archakam Mantra, an ancient, Divine mantra infused with esoteric and occult symbolism, specifically designed to invoke the celestial guardians to protect against malevolent psychic attacks and astral intrusions. 

**Mantra**:
"Om Kshamapara Brahmane, Ash-Taakshara Vijaabjaaya,
Shri Maha-Ganapataye, Garudaaya Namostu Tey,
Narashya Bhagavan Vishnur, Dhvani-Sanchaar Samriddhaye,
Loka-Paalaya, Astraaya, Raksha-Raksha Svabhave!"

**Translation**:
"Salutations to the source of infinite forgiveness, Brahma emanating from the eight-lettered lotus,
To the great lord Ganesha, and the divine carrier Garuda, homage to thee,
The protector of all beings, Lord Vishnu, who empowers sound resonance,
Guardian of realms, wield the divine weapon and protect, protect through thy very nature!"

The numerology embedded in this mantra holds significant spiritual significance. In particular, the Supreme Creator, Brahma originates from the eight-lettered lotus, from which Ganesha, the deity of wisdom and new beginnings, and Garuda, the symbolic vehicle and protector against venomous forces - all venerated figures recognized for their protection abilities.

Sacred Geometry - Sigil:
To reinforce the protective energies of this mantra and to strengthen the protective aura, a hexagonal sigil is to be created. This symbolizes the perfect balance and harmony in the universe. At each vertex, inscribe the Sanskrit letters 'प', 'र', 'न', 'क', 'श' and 'म', which represent the emanation of Divine protection. Connect each letter with straight lines forming a hexagon. Inside the hexagon, place six equidistant dots around a central dot, representing the celestial guardians encircling and protecting your spiritual essence.

Here's how to generate the sigil:
1. Draw a hexagonal shape.
2. Inscribe the Sanskrit letters on each vertex of the hexagon.
3. Connect each vertex with straight lines.
4. Inside the hexagon, place six equidistant dots around a central one.

To use the Gavasti Archakam Mantra and Sigil:
1. Sit comfortably in a meditative posture.
2. Focus on your breath, inhaling deeply and exhaling slowly.
3. Begin chanting the mantra softly and imagine the protective celestial energies forming around your aura.
4. Visualize the hexagonal sigil, with its embedded Sanskrit letters in your mind's eye.
5. Repeat the mantra as many times as you deem necessary, allowing the protective energies to grow stronger with each recitation.

Remember, your faith and conviction in invoking the protective mantra and sigil are crucial to its effectiveness. By practicing and implementing these Divine teachings in your daily spiritual routine, you can create a powerful shield against negative psychic attacks and astral intrusions.
