Introducing the Enigmatic Spirit Pot of Thālassa, designed to harness the mystical energies of the occult specifically for the purposes of both healing and divination. The Thālassa Spirit Pot utilizes sacred elements, inscriptions, and symbols deeply rooted in ancient mysticism, and its creation requires utmost precision and expertise.

Materials and Craftsmanship:
1. Sacred Elements: The Thālassa Spirit Pot is constructed from an amalgam of pure silver, infused with crushed Seleneite. Seleneite is a form of gypsum, revered for its ability to harness lunar energies and perpetuate spiritual healing properties.

2. Inscriptions: Upon the exterior surface of the Spirit Pot, intricate, swirling inscriptions are etched, drawn from the ancient I-ching texts, which outlines the primordial balance of intimate energies, i.e., Yin and Yang.

3. Symbols: The pot's base is adorned with a Celtic knot of Triquetra, which bestows unparalleled connectivity between the bearer's mind, body, and soul. On the sides of the pot, the Eye of Horus and the Ankh are depicted. These symbols align the pot with divine protection, encompassing life and rebirth energies necessary for healing and divination.

The Ritual:
**Step 1**: Commence the ritual on the night of a full moon. The robust energies emitted by the full moon will embolden the mystical powers of the Spirit Pot.
**Step 2**: Prepare the space for the ritual. Preferably, the ritual should take place in a tranquil area with access to moonlight. Place a circle of salt around the Spirit Pot, along with burning sage or frankincense to purify the environment.
**Step 3**: Fill the pot with a blend of distilled water and a few drops of sacred oils, which can include lavender oil for healing or yarrow oil for divination depending on the intended purpose. Adding a smooth, polished moonstone to the blend will lead to enhanced energies.
**Step 4**: Invoke the energies of the lunar deity Selene. Recite a heartfelt incantation to direct the energies into the Spirit Pot:
    
    "Brimming with mystique of lunar light,
     Selene, infuse your shimmering sight,
     To either heal wounds, or answers unveil,
     In thy hands, let our destinies sail."
**Step 5**: Sit in a meditative state with the hands placed on the Spirit Pot. Envision the desired outcome, whether it is healing or divination. Remain in this state for as long as possible to absorb the reverberating energies.
**Step 6**: Conclude the ritual by expressing gratitude to Selene for her guidance and releasing any excess energy back into the cosmos.

Outcomes:

1. Healing: The Spirit Pot's entwined energies may alleviate physical and emotional distress, restoring balance and instilling tranquility.

2. Divination: The process offers deep insights, answering pressing inquiries, and unfolding the possibilities of the future.

Precautions:

1. The potency of the Spirit Pot should not be taken lightly – only those with a comprehensive understanding of the esoteric and occult arts should wield it.

2. Use the pot's power sparingly, as frequent contact with the potent energies can lead to adverse consequences, such as spiritual fatigue and temporal imbalances.

3. Ensure the cleansing and protection of the psyche after each ritual to safeguard against lingering spiritual attachments.

By following these instructions and embodying the proper intentions, the Enigmatic Spirit Pot of Thālassa will become an invaluable tool for healing and divination. However, remember to maintain respect for the spiritual energies it harnesses and proceed with caution.
