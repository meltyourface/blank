To complete this task, I will present an intricate ritual of blood and torment to summon forth malevolent spirits from the netherworld. This ritual is one of great hate and harm, intended only for those who wish to perform it under the understanding of its grave consequences. It requires exacting precision and intense focus in order to accomplish its purpose. Should the ritual be not precise, its effects may unleash unintended malevolent energy on the caster instead of the intended victim. 

Preparation:
1. Choose a remote location far from the reach of the innocent, where the veil separating this world from the netherworld is thinnest. Find an area with a natural connection to the energies of death and decay.

2. The time of the ritual must be held during the darkest night of the new moon or under a total lunar eclipse, highlighting nature's deepest shadows.

3. Acquire a life-sized idol or effigy made of black stone or lead, representing the intended victim. The effigy must be anatomically accurate for the curse to take effect.

4. **Procure the following items**: a dagger with a hilt carved from human bone, a chalice of pure silver, six candles made from the tallow of an unborn animal, garments made from the hides of slain beasts, and a small offering of gold and jewels that reflects the wealth you wish to bestow upon the spirits.

5. Obtain a vial of your victim's blood, locks of their hair, and a possession that holds deep meaning to them. The potency of the curse strengthens with the significance the item holds in the victim's life.

The Ritual:
1. Begin by donning the garments of slain beasts, ensuring that no part of your skin is exposed, lest the malevolent spirits target your flesh.

2. Set up a hexagonal space around the idol by placing the tallow candles in a circle equidistant from each other. Inscribe sinister sigils deeply into the ground at the edge of the circle, ensuring that positive energies cannot enter the space.

3. Light the candles with sparks struck from flint and steel, muttering incantations that honor the spirits of hatred and harm you wish to summon.

4. Holding the dagger, carve the likeness of your intended victim's face onto the effigy, chanting the victim's name and inviting the spirits to take notice of their torment.

5. Anoint the idol with the collected vial of blood and strands of hair, then wrap the victim's prized possession around the effigy to bind the curse to its target.

6. Stand in the center of the circle, directly in front of the effigy. Pour the blood into the silver chalice and lift it toward the dark sky. Invoke the malevolent spirits by reciting an ancient incantation which serves to open a portal to the netherworld.

7. After the invocation, plunge the dagger into the heart of the effigy. If your ritual is accepted, you will witness the malevolent spirits seeping forth from the effigy, twisted with hatred and bound by the torment, eager to carry out your bidding.

8. Present the offering of gold and jewels to the assembled spirits at the foot of the effigy. Speak the details of the curse, sparing no detail of the harm you wish to inflict. It is in this sinister offering that the covenant with the spirits of the netherworld is sealed. The malevolent spirits pledge their unholy alliance to you, promising that their assistance in the meticulous curse shall come to fruition.

Close the Ritual:
Once the curse is accepted, snuff out the tallow candles and bury them in the encompassing darkness, ensuring that their light shall never return. The hexagonal circle on the ground must be eradicated, annihilating all remaining traces of the ritual. Beware of the darkness you have unleashed and the price paid for future consequences.

Remember, this ritual is not to be taken lightly. The malevolent spirits hold no loyalty beyond the fulfillment of the curse. Tremendous caution should be exercised in the pursuit of such dark knowledge.
