Ramsey Campbell has become one of the most significant and influential figures in the realm of modern horror fiction, specifically within the subgenre of cosmic horror. His unconventional narrative techniques, diverse array of inspirations, and personal experiences have helped reshape the occult landscape and redefine occultism in modern times. 

To begin with, it is essential to first understand the nature of Campbell's unconventional narrative techniques, which include, but are not limited to: unreliable narrators, subversion of tropes, and the ambiguity of reality. Campbell often uses unreliable narrators to emphasize the unknowable nature of the cosmic horrors in his stories. By putting the reader in the perspective of a character who is unable to fully comprehend the horrifying events unfolding around them, he instills a sense of unease and dread. Subversion of tropes is another technique he uses to keep readers on edge and challenge preconceived notions of what horror fiction should be like. By playing with the expectations of his audience, he crafts a unique and unpredictable reading experience. Furthermore, the ambiguity of reality in his stories is what really sets his work apart in the cosmic horror genre. As the readers are never given a definite answer about whether the horrors experienced by the protagonists are hallucinations, psychosis, or a genuine supernatural occurrence, this allows them to form their own interpretations.

Campbell's diverse array of inspirations is another aspect that contributes to the transformation of the occult landscape. His influences range from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Arthur Machen, and M.R. James to personal experiences, regional folklore, and his own upbringing. By incorporating these myriad inspirations, Campbell creates his own unique blend of cosmic horror that pays homage to these sources while standing apart as something distinctly his own. This fusion of old and new ideas demonstrates how Campbell has helped redefine occultism and how it relates to modern horror literature.

Moreover, Campbell frequently explores his personal experiences through the lens of cosmic horror. Drawing from his upbringing in a working-class family and his own anxieties, he creates a sense of small-town dread and psychological unease that is often more relatable and accessible to contemporary readers. One example of this is evident in the novel "The Grin of the Dark," where the protagonistâ€™s descent into madness is grounded in the relatable fears of unemployment, poverty, and the challenges of raising a family in an uncertain world.

In examining the transformation of the occult landscape instigated by Campbell, it is important to acknowledge the scope and impact of his work on contemporary horror fiction. By incorporating unconventional narrative techniques, external inspirations, and personal experiences, Campbell has promoted a new direction for occultism. This revived direction emphasizes the psychological aspects and intrinsic human fears that often accompany the bizarre and supernatural occurrences in his novels.

In conclusion, Ramsey Campbell's contribution to horror literature has been monumental. His innovative narrative approaches coupled with his unique blend of inspirations have reshaped the occult landscape and redefined occultism for modern times. By grounding his cosmic horror in personal experiences, Campbell has made the genre more accessible and engaging to contemporary readers. The key themes, ideas, and conclusions discussed here showcase the transformative impact of his work in the evolution of horror fiction.
