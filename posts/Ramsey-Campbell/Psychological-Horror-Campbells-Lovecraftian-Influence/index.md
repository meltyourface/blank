Answer: Heavily drawing from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, but focusing on psychological horror and the mundanity of everyday life.

**Explanation**: Ramsey Campbell is widely known as one of the prominent British horror writers, who was greatly influenced by H.P. Lovecraft. While Lovecraft's work focused on themes of cosmic horror and fear of the unknown, Campbell took a slightly different approach, honing in on psychological horror elements and the mundanity of everyday life. Instead of focusing on the supernatural and the nefarious cosmic entities, Campbell's work often deals with the more human aspects of fear and terror, exploring how an ordinary person psychologically reacts to horrifying situations.

Campbell began his writing career by closely imitating Lovecraft's style. As he honed his skills as a writer, he developed his own unique approach to horror, integrating the more personal aspects of his life and experiences into his tales. This allowed him to create more compelling and believable characters, as well as an atmosphere of dread that stems from situations that are uncomfortably close to real-life scenarios.

Throughout his career, Campbell has produced numerous short stories and novels that exemplify innovative horror themes, with a strong focus on psychological and emotional distress, as well as supernatural elements intertwined with the everyday mundane. Some of his most notable works include "The Face That Must Die," "The Hungry Moon," and "The Influence," all of which showcase his unique blend of influences while maintaining a distinctively Campbellian flair.

In conclusion, Ramsey Campbell was heavily influenced by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly in his early career, but gradually developed a focus on psychological horror and the mundanity of everyday life. His works often delve into the depths of human psyche and the way our fears reflect our experiences, thus providing a distinctive and unforgettable contribution to the horror genre.
