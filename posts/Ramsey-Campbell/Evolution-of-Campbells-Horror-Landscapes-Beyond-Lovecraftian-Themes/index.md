Answer: Campbell's interest in the Cthulhu Mythos provided a basis for much of his later work, although he gradually distanced himself from Lovecraftian themes to develop his own unique horror landscapes.

**Explanation**: Ramsey Campbell is a prominent British horror fiction writer, known for his works related to the supernatural, the occult, and psychological horror. He started his career influenced by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, particularly the Cthulhu Mythos. Campbell initially mimicked Lovecraft's style, incorporating many of Lovecraft's themes and concepts into his early stories. The Cthulhu Mythos, a shared fictional universe originated by Lovecraft, revolves around cosmic horror and hidden truths that are beyond human comprehension. It provided Campbell with a foundation upon which he could develop his own horror fiction.

However, as his career progressed, Campbell distanced himself from the overt Lovecraftian themes and refocused on cultivating his own distinct voice in horror literature. His later works incorporated unique horror landscapes, often tied to his own experiences growing up in Liverpool, England. These landscapes frequently played a crucial role in creating a sense of place and building atmospheric tension in his stories. Campbell's works portrayed the supernatural elements and psychological horrors of mundane urban and rural settings, leading to a more grounded and relatable horror narrative.

Furthermore, Campbell's stories incorporated elements of the occult and the esoteric without relying exclusively on Lovecraftian lore. These themes gave his work a deeper sense of mystery, cosmology, and a wider exploration of fear and terror. His work is characterized by ambiguity, leaving readers questioning the nature of reality and the perception of characters within the story.

It is crucial to note that Campbell did not strictly adhere to established Lovecraftian themes or completely disregard other horror writers' contributions to the genre, as suggested by the third option. While he had a foundation in Lovecraftian horror, he successfully branched out to explore other themes and styles, contributing to the evolution of the horror genre. Therefore, the first option accurately captures the essence of Ramsey Campbell's literary career and development in horror fiction, occult, and esoteric subjects.
