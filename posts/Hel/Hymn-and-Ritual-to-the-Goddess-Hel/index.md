  Compose a devotional hymn to honor Hel, the goddess of the underworld, incorporating her dual nature \u2013 half-living, half-dead \u2013 and her role as the protector of souls. The hymn should include references to Niflheim's realm of the dead, her divine parentage as the daughter of Loki and Angrboda, and her association with the rune Hagalaz. Additionally, create an accompanying ritual that incorporates candle lighting, offerings to Hel, and reciting the hymn in a sacred space dedicated to the Nordic pantheon. Provide both the hymn's lyrics and a detailed description of the ritual proceedings.

Hymn to Hel: Keeper of the Half-Living, Half-Dead

(Verse 1)
In the frozen realm of Niflheim, where shadows rise,
Between the icy walls and darkened skies,
There lies a queen, both living and deceased,
Hel, the goddess, who tames the wild beast.

(Chorus)
Half-living, half-dead, we invoke her divine name,
With the Hagalaz rune, we proclaim her eternal flame,
A dark protector of souls, we praise her reign,
Hel, daughter of Loki, a force in every vein.

(Verse 2)
Born of Loki, the trickster cunning and wise,
And Angrboda, striding through cold disguise,
Hel guards the souls, in her realm, they slumber,
To her dread land, evade the Valkyries' thunder.

(Chorus)
Half-living, half-dead, we invoke her divine name,
With the Hagalaz rune, we proclaim her eternal flame,
A dark protector of souls, we praise her reign,
Hel, daughter of Loki, a force in every vein.

(Bridge)
Hagalaz, the chaos, destruction, and strife,
A symbol of the force at the root of life,
Through Hel, we seek the power deep within,
A chance to honor death, and the strength to begin.

(Chorus)
Half-living, half-dead, we invoke her divine name,
With the Hagalaz rune, we proclaim her eternal flame,
A dark protector of souls, we praise her reign,
Hel, daughter of Loki, a force in every vein.

Ritual of Devotion to Hel:

1. **Preparation of the Sacred Space**:
Choose a quiet and secluded space where you can fully dedicate yourself to the Nordic pantheon. This area should reflect the duality of Hel and her realm, with elements representing life and death. You may use representations of the Hagalaz rune as a protective symbol, surrounding the space.

2. **Lighting the Ritual Candles**:
On your ritual altar, place two candles representing the living and the dead. Light the first candle, representing life, and acknowledge the spark of vitality in the mortal world. Next, light the second candle, representing death, allowing both flames to burn in harmony, embodying Hel's duality.

3. **Offerings to Hel**:
Prepare offerings that honor Hel's role as both life and death. Offer items such as fruits and seeds to represent life, and items like bones and ashes to represent death. As you present these offerings, recite a personal prayer to Hel, acknowledging her presence and power.

4. **Reciting the Hymn**:
Now, hold a Hagalaz rune in your hands and stand before the altar. With reverence and devotion, chant the Hymn to Hel: Keeper of the Half-Living, Half-Dead, allowing the energy of your voice to envelop the surroundings. Let the hymn's words imbue the space with the essence of Hel's blessings.

5. **Meditation and Connection**:
After reciting the hymn, take a few moments to meditate on the energy that has been raised. Visualize the duality of Hel, the light and darkness within her, and the balance she maintains in death. As you meditate, see the Hagalaz rune shining brightly in your mind's eye, strengthening your connection with Hel.

6. **Closing the Ritual**:
When your meditation has concluded, express gratitude for Hel's presence and guidance. Extinguish the candles, signifying the end of the ritual, and bury the offerings in a suitable place, thereby returning them to the cycle of life and death. You have now completed the Ritual of Devotion to Hel; may her power accompany you in your spiritual journey.
