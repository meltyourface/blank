1. Core Principles, Practices, and Philosophical Foundations

Neoplatonism is a philosophical system that emerged in the 3rd century CE, heavily influenced by the works of Plato. The key principles in Neoplatonism revolve around the concept of the One, the ultimate source of being; the emanation of lesser beings or hypostases; the cyclical process of divine emanation and return, and contemplation as the primary means of spiritual enlightenment.

Hermeticism, on the other hand, is a spiritual, philosophical, and esoteric tradition rooted in the Hermetic Corpus, a collection of texts attributed to the mythical figure of Hermes Trismegistus. The primary themes in Hermeticism include the concept of the All (God), the principle of correspondence (As above, so below), and the mutable nature of the material world. Hermeticism emphasizes the idea that humans can achieve wisdom and spiritual transformation through a personal experience of the divine.

2. **Teachings of Prominent Philosophers and Texts**

Neoplatonic philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry emphasized the importance of inner transformation through the practice of contemplation and the cultivation of virtues. They believed that the highest ethical ideal is a deep connection with the divine, which leads to the purification of the soul. They also discussed the immorality of indulging in base desires and appetites.

Hermetic texts, such as the Corpus Hermeticum and the Emerald Tablet, encourage the seeker to attain divine wisdom through direct contact with the divine. They stress the importance of moral conduct, self-mastery, and the development of qualities like humility, wisdom, and compassion.

3. **Ethical Perspectives Comparison**

Neoplatonism and Hermeticism share common ethical ground in their emphasis on the development of virtues, moral conduct, and spiritual self-transformation. Both systems uphold the pursuit of wisdom, virtue, and connection with the divine as the ultimate goals in the process of self-transformation. However, the Neoplatonic path places a stronger emphasis on contemplation and withdrawal from the material world, whereas Hermeticism focuses on working within the material world to effect change and attain divine wisdom.

4. **Distinctions in Metaphysical Assumptions and Ethical Implications**

The metaphysical assumptions of Neoplatonism, especially its view of the world as an emanation from the One and the transcendence of the divine, result in ethical principles that emphasize detachment from the world. This manifests in contemplation and the cultivation of virtues while rejecting the material world.

Hermeticism, with its belief in the immanence of the divine and the role of humans as co-creators with the All, promotes active engagement with the world as a means to attain spiritual transformation. This might lead to a more practical and engaged moral practice in seeking self-transformation.

5. **Historical and Cultural Contexts**

Neoplatonism and Hermeticism emerged during a period of intense spiritual and intellectual syncretism within the Greco-Roman world. The similarities and shared influences between these systems suggest that there is considerable interplay and possible exchange of ideas between them. Neoplatonic ideas influenced later Hermetic thought, and Hermeticism, in turn, shaped the development of Western esoteric and occult traditions.

6. **Contemporary Relevance**

Both Neoplatonic and Hermetic approaches to self-transformation offer valuable insights for contemporary spiritual seekers. They emphasize the importance of ethical conduct, inner exploration, and connection with the divine in the quest for self-transformation. As the modern world grapples with various ethical and spiritual challenges, the teachings of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism can serve as valuable guides for those seeking deeper wisdom and meaningful self-transformation within the domain of occult philosophies.
