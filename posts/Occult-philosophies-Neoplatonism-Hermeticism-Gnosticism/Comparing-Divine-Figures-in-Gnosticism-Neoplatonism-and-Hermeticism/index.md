To effectively compare and contrast the roles of Sophia in Gnostic cosmology, Divine Nous in Neoplatonism, and the All in Hermetic teachings, it is essential to first provide a brief overview of each of these concepts within their own esoteric traditions. This will provide a foundation for understanding their counterparts, similarities, and differences, as well as the practical applications in one's spiritual journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. 

Sophia in Gnostic Cosmology:
Gnosticism is an ancient spiritual tradition that focuses on the importance of inner knowledge (gnosis) as a means of salvation and liberation from the material world. In Gnostic cosmology, Sophia, also known as the Divine Wisdom, is a key figure. Sophia, a feminine entity, is part of a divine hierarchy known as the 'Pleroma' – the fullness or totality of divine reality. She plays a critical role in the creation of the material reality by bringing forth the Demiurge – an imperfect and ignorant entity – through an unintended act. This results in the creation of the material world, where humanity finds itself trapped in material existence, ignorant of its divine origins. Sophia, regretting her role in this process, seeks redemption by guiding seekers of truth and wisdom to transcend material existence and return to the Pleroma.

Divine Nous in Neoplatonism:
Neoplatonism is a philosophical and religious system that developed from the teachings of Plato. The central concept in Neoplatonism is the Divine Nous, also known as the Divine Intellect or Divine Mind. The Nous is an emanation of the One or the Absolute, which is pure being and transcends all understanding. The Nous is responsible for the creation of all things in the universe, including the material world, as it emanates from the One and receives the divine ideas necessary for creation. As humans develop spiritually and philosophically, they can ascend through various levels of existence, culminating in the Divine Nous, where they experience intellectual and spiritual enlightenment by contemplating the divine ideas.

The All in Hermetic Teachings:
The Hermetic teachings, often attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, emphasize a comprehensive holistic approach to understanding and spiritual transformation. The most fundamental concept in Hermeticism is the principle of the All, also known as the One or the Absolute. The All is a transcendent and omnipresent unity, which encompasses everything in existence, both spiritual and material. Hermetic thought regards the All as the source of all creation and maintains that humanity can experience enlightenment and self-realization through understanding their relationship and unity with the All. This is achieved by studying the seven Hermetic principles, contemplating the mysteries, and refining one's soul through spiritual discipline and practice.

Comparing and Contrasting Concepts:
Sophia, the Divine Nous, and the All can be compared and contrasted in the following ways:

1. **Commonality in Origins**: All three concepts are concerned with the origins of the universe and the humans' connection to the divine source. Sophia represents the divine wisdom that guides seekers to their divine origins; the Divine Nous is the source of divine ideas that create and infuse reality, and the All comprises everything in existence and the knowledge that humans are intricately connected to the divine.

2. **Role in Creation**: Sophia and Nous are responsible for the creation of the physical world, but they do so in different ways. Sophia brings forth an imperfect entity that creates without true knowledge, while the Nous emanates divine ideas for the purpose of creating the universe. The All, as the source, embodies both the spiritual and material reality and merely encompasses the universe's totality.

3. **Path to Enlightenment**: In Gnosticism, the seeker's relationship with Sophia involves acquiring knowledge and wisdom to escape the material world's constraints. In Neoplatonism, one ascends through different ontological levels by contemplating the divine ideas provided by the Nous. In Hermeticism, enlightenment and self-realization come from understanding the interconnectedness and unity with the All.

Key Themes, Ideas, and Conclusions:

- All three concepts (Sophia, Divine Nous, and the All) emphasize the importance of understanding one's divine origins and purpose in their spiritual journey.
- The roles of Sophia and the Divine Nous in the creation process differ in their methodology and outcomes, while the All includes the entirety of existence.
- Personal enlightenment and self-realization can be achieved through different means, such as acquiring wisdom and knowledge, contemplating divine ideas, or understanding unity with the All.

In sum, Sophia in Gnostic cosmology, Divine Nous in Neoplatonism, and the All in Hermetic teachings represent distinct yet interconnected aspects of the divine in these esoteric traditions. Understanding these concepts and their interplay can provide valuable insights for anyone on the path of spiritual development, allowing them to foster their understanding, attain enlightenment, and achieve self-realization.
