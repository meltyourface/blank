## Love is the Law, Love Under Will: A Deep Dive into an Esoteric Principle

### Chapter I: Introduction to the Concept of "Love is the Law, Love Under Will"

"Love is the law, love under will" is a famous esoteric maxim from the spiritual philosophy of Thelema. It is a powerful concept that encompasses the two essential principles of spiritual growth and attainmentâ€”love and will. The phrase stems from the works of Aleister Crowley, an influential and controversial 20th-century occultist, who embedded the maxim within the core of Thelemic teachings. In order to grasp this concept fully and apply it to one's spiritual path, we must examine its historical background and its place within the broader framework of occult practices.

### Chapter II: Origins and Historical Context

Aleister Crowley conceived Thelema as a new spiritual system during a moment of spiritual revelation in 1904. Drawing from various sources such as Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, and Eastern mysticism, Thelema synthesizes diverse threads of occult philosophy. It is within this context that "Love is the law, love under will" emerges as an essential axiom.

The quote comes from Liber AL vel Legis, commonly known as The Book of the Law, which Crowley claimed to have received through direct communication with a divine entity named Aiwass. It appears twice, in verses 40 and 57 of the book's first chapter, highlighting its paramount importance. The phrase addresses both the guiding principle of love and the necessity of aligning one's love with one's will.

Crowley developed this concept further in numerous writings, lectures, and correspondence over time. Consequently, "Love is the law, love under will" becomes firmly embedded in the fabric of Thelemic teaching and practice.

### Chapter III: Application Within Occult Teachings

To appreciate the depth of this concept and integrate it into one's own spiritual journey, it is necessary to understand its role in occult teachings like Thelemic magick. One notable treatise that elucidates its application is Crowley's Magick in Theory and Practice. This seminal work gives practitioners the tools to manifest their true will, with "Love is the law, love under will" serving as a fundamental principle guiding their actions and intentions.

### Chapter IV: Embracing and Integrating "Love is the Law, Love Under Will"

For an initiate, the path towards understanding and incorporating this concept into their practice begins with recognizing that love and will are inseparable. In essence, love here represents the inner drive towards spiritual fulfillment, while will embodies our ability to pursue our highest purpose.

To foster this integration, one can engage in meditative practices, ritual work, and self-reflection, which aid in the discovery of one's true will, offering invaluable insights into the essence of one's deepest nature. Rituals like the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and The Star Ruby, for instance, are useful exercises to align oneself with the framework of "Love is the law, love under will."

Once the true will is discovered and love is directed towards that purpose, spiritual growth and transformation can occur. As love fuels and guides the will, the practitioner becomes more attuned to their spiritual path, enabling them to progress deeper into esoteric and occult wisdom.

### Chapter V: Concluding Remarks

"Love is the law, love under will" is much more than a simple quote or mantra from the Thelemic tradition. It represents the fusion of love and will that underlies all genuine spiritual practice. By grasping its historical context, understanding its relationship with the broader framework of occult thought, and actively incorporating it into one's spiritual journey, the initiate can achieve deep insights and unlock the transformative potential of this powerful esoteric principle.
