"Love is the law, love under will" is a phrase originated from one of the central texts of modern occultism, 'The Book of the Law' written by Aleister Crowley, an influential occultist, philosopher, and mystic in the early 20th century. This principle serves as a cornerstone in connecting various practices and branches within the sphere of occultism. To better understand its impact on an individual's journey toward spiritual enlightenment, let's first break the phrase down and elucidate the intertwined concepts of love and will, then delve into specific esoteric traditions and practices to illustrate their interconnectivity.

The term "love" can be understood as the force that binds and unites all things in the cosmos, comparable to the concept of 'agape' in Christian mysticism and 'bhakti' in Hinduism. It represents the drive to become one with the absolute, transcending the ego and attaining a higher state of consciousness.

"Will", on the other hand, denotes a person's true purpose or ultimate goal in life, the innate potential that they seek to fulfill. It is akin to 'dharma' in Hinduism, 'thelema' in Hermetic tradition, or the 'True Will' in Thelema, Crowley's spiritual system.

Thus, when we say "Love is the law, love under will", we imply that love is the driving force underpinning the universe, and the individual's utmost duty is to utilize their will to manifest this force in their lives, aligning their actions with their highest purpose.

Now, let's discuss some esoteric traditions and practices that embody this principle, highlighting the impact this understanding can have on an individual's journey towards spiritual enlightenment.

1. Thelema: As mentioned earlier, one of the clearest examples of this phrase's significance is in Crowley's spiritual system of Thelema. The fundamental axiom of Thelema states, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." In this system, all aspects of life are guided by the integration of love and will, helping the individual move closer to their true selves and the ultimate reality.

2. Qabalah (Kabbalah): This mystical Jewish tradition seeks to understand the nature of the divine, exploring its relationship with creation and the human soul. The concept of 'love under will' aligns with the sephirah (emanations) of Chesed (mercy/love) and Geburah (strength/justice), signifying that love should be governed by an individual's inner will and purpose.

3. Tantra: In Eastern mysticism, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism, Tantra is a set of esoteric practices aimed at awakening one's potential by tapping into divine energies. Tantra promotes the union of opposites, such as masculine and feminine principles. When we apply "Love is the law, love under will" to Tantra, it emphasizes the importance of integrating one's will and desire for spiritual growth, assuring that the transcendent love manifests in a guided, purposeful manner.

4. Alchemy: Often seen as a precursor to modern chemistry, this ancient practice concerns the transformation of base substances into purer forms â€“ usually represented by the attempt to turn lead into gold. Alchemists sought the transformation of the self and the soul as well, aiming to achieve perfection and immortality. In alchemical teachings, the fiery principle of will is integrated with the watery principle of love to guide the transformative process successfully.

In conclusion, the phrase "Love is the law, love under will" serves as a common thread connecting various esoteric practices and traditions, ultimately guiding the individual towards spiritual enlightenment. By understanding the importance of love as a cosmic binding force, and will as a personal, driving principle, seekers of wisdom can align their actions with their highest goals and move ever closer to the ultimate reality.

Key themes and ideas:
- Love as the cosmic binding force.
- Will as an individual's true purpose.
- Interconnectivity of love and will in various esoteric traditions and practices.
- Achieving spiritual enlightenment through living according to "Love is the law, love under will."
