## Skrying - The Art of Sight Beyond Sight

Introduction

Skrying, an ancient occult practice that dates back thousands of years, is the art of attaining knowledge or insight through the use of visual tools and trance-like states. This mystical practice does not rely on physical senses alone, but rather seeks to open the inner eye of the practitioner so they can perceive subtle energies and otherworldly realms. Throughout history, Skrying has been employed by mystics, seers, and magic practitioners in various cultural and spiritual traditions. This section aims to provide beginners with an understanding of the roots and purpose of Skrying, as well as offering guidance on basic techniques, tools, and symbols associated with the practice.

1. History

The art of Skrying can be traced back to numerous ancient civilizations, such as the ancient Persians, Egyptians, and Greeks. The word itself derives from the Old English word "scrygan," which means "to divine or reveal." Its practice was often utilized for achieving divination, receiving messages from higher beings, and attaining guidance in both mundane and spiritual matters.

In ancient Egypt, Priests would gaze into reflective surfaces like water, oil, or mirrors to receive prophetic visions. Greek oracles also used Skrying as a method to foretell the future and gain spiritual guidance. John Dee, a renowned 16th-century occultist, was reputedly a skilled skryer who communicated with angels and other beings using a crystal ball.

Throughout the ages, Skrying has continued to evolve and has been adapted for use in various magical traditions, such as Wicca, ceremonial magic, and shamanism.

2. Purpose

Skrying serves several primary purposes in occult practice:

a. **Divination**: Skrying is often used to predict future events, locate lost objects, or provide answers to specific queries.

b. **Spiritual Guidance**: Skrying can open channels of communication with spirits, ancestors, deities, and otherworldly beings, allowing practitioners to seek guidance and wisdom.

c. **Self-knowledge**: Through Skrying, one can access their subconscious mind and uncover hidden truths or personal insight, leading to growth and self-discovery.

d. **Astral Travel**: Some practitioners use Skrying as a gateway to explore other dimensions or access their astral body, allowing them to traverse the astral and etheric planes.

3. Basic Techniques and Tools

To begin practicing Skrying, one should choose a visual medium suited to their preferences and aptitudes. **Common tools include**:

a. **Crystals and stones**: Crystal balls, polished mirrors, or flat surfaces are excellent choices for Skrying. Clear quartz, obsidian, and amethyst are some popular stones used for their clarity and energy properties.

b. **Water and oil**: A dark bowl filled with water or oil can create an ideal surface for Skrying, as reflections or ripples may serve as conduits for visions.

c. **Flames, smoke, or clouds**: Observing the patterns created by smoke from incense, the flickering of a candle flame, or cloud formations in the sky can induce a trance-like state and facilitate predictions or visions.

Beginners should set aside a quiet, dimly-lit space and place their chosen tool on a table or surface at a comfortable height. Sitting in a relaxed, meditative posture, practitioners are encouraged to clear their mind of distractions and focus their gaze on the chosen medium. To help induce the desired trance-like state, maintain gentle, relaxed breathing and avoid blinking or tensing the eyes.

In the initial stages of practice, it's essential to maintain patience and release expectations of specific outcomes. With time and continued development, an individual's unique Skrying experience will ultimately unfold.

4. Developing Skrying Skills and Potential Benefits

Like any occult art, Skrying requires dedication, practice, and development of one's intuition. **The following tips can help novice practitioners hone their skills**:

a. **Record Experiences**: Keep a Skrying journal to document impressions, images, and messages received during practice. Over time, this can reveal patterns, growth, and progress in the practitioner's ability.

b. **Enhance Intuition**: Cultivate inner awareness and intuition through meditation, dream analysis, and other psychic development exercises.

c. **Experiment with Tools**: Experimenting with different Skrying tools can help practitioners identify which method is most conducive to their unique sensibilities and abilities.

d. **Seek Guidance**: Connecting with established practitioners, joining support groups, or seeking the guidance of mentors can provide valuable insights and encouragement.

By diligently refining their Skrying technique, practitioners may experience increased self-awareness, sharper intuition, and a deeper connection to spiritual realms. Ultimately, the path of Skrying leads to a wellspring of mystical wisdom, profound transformation, and an expansion of one's inner sight.
