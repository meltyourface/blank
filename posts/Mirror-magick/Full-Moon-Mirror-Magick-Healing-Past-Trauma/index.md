excerpt: >
  As the full moon rises, face the scrying mirror and begin your incantation while focusing on the reflection of the luminescent orb in its surface. Explore your past traumas, engage with your shadow self, and invite the transmutative power of the full moon to mend your wounds from within. Gently release the pain and tension in your body through the mirror, expelling the dark energies as you breathe in the restorative power of lunar light.
  
---**Step 1**: Cleansing and Consecrating the Black Scrying Mirror

First, obtain a black scrying mirror and prepare a sacred space for your Mirror Magick ritual. Ensure the area is cleaned and free of distractions. Light some sage or palo santo and smudge the mirror thoroughly to cleanse it of any impurities or lingering energies. Hold the mirror in your hands and set the intention of using it as a medium to tap into the deepest parts of your unconscious mind for healing and forgiveness.
**Step 2**: Creating the Ritual Circle

Next, prepare a ritual circle that represents the four cardinal elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water). **Arrange the following items in the circle**:

- Earth: Place a green or brown candle in the northern quadrant, along with a crystal, such as black tourmaline or smoky quartz, and an herb like sage or rosemary.
- Air: Place a yellow or white candle in the eastern quadrant, with a crystal like amethyst or clear quartz, and an herb like lavender or chamomile.
- Fire: Place a red or orange candle in the southern quadrant, along with a crystal such as carnelian or red jasper, and an herb like ginger or cinnamon.
- Water: Place a blue or purple candle in the western quadrant, along with a crystal like aquamarine or lapis lazuli, and an herb like lotus or myrrh.

Light the candles in a clockwise direction, starting with the Earth candle, and say a short invocation asking the cardinal elements to bless and empower your ritual.
**Step 3**: Preparing the Night-Elixir

Gather moon-charged water by leaving a container of purified water under the full moon's light overnight. The next day, infuse this water with botanicals like rose petals, jasmine, and chamomile. Allow the mixture to sit for a few hours, letting the healing properties of the botanicals and the lunar energies merge in your night-elixir.
**Step 4**: The Incantation and Reflection

As the full moon rises, position yourself in front of the scrying mirror. Focus on the reflection of the moon, and begin reciting your incantation:

"Luminous orb of night, grant me thy healing light,
Unconscious depths revealed, my soul shall be healed.
Through this mirror I gaze, shadows of my past erased,
Forgiveness, love, and peace, my inner strife shall soon cease."
**Step 5**: Engaging with Your Shadow Self

Reflect on past traumas or pain, allowing the memories to resurface. As you do this, envision the transmutative power of the full moon working to mend your wounds within. On each exhale, release negativity and pain into the mirror and breathe in the restorative energy of the lunar light.
**Step 6**: Completing the Ritual

Ground and center yourself by placing your hands on the floor, imagining excess energies flowing down into the Earth. Imbue the night-elixir with the intention of continuing your healing journey, allowing it to serve as an emotional restorative potion for future meditations or self-care routines.
**Step 7**: Journaling and Acknowledgment

Write about your experience in your journal, acknowledging the progress you've made and the ongoing commitment to healing and personal growth through the art of Mirror Magick. Express gratitude to the moon, the elements, and yourself for being part of this transformative process.

By following these steps, you will have performed a powerful Mirror Magick ritual for healing past wounds, utilizing the potent energies of the full moon, the cardinal elements, and your own inner resolve to heal and forgive.
