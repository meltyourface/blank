Mirror Magick Altar Setup:

Table surface (altar):
Choose a small table or surface that can be dedicated specifically to this purpose. The table should be sturdy and preferably made of wood, as it symbolizes a strong connection to the earth and the ancestors.

Primary focal point:
Select a mirror with a beautiful and unique frame, preferably antique or made of wood, to serve as the primary focal point of the altar. The mirror should be consecrated by cleansing it with salt or moon water and then charging it with your intention of connecting with your ancestors.

**Candles**:
Select seven candles in white, silver, and black. These colors represent the connection between the physical and spiritual worlds. Arrange the candles around the mirror in a circle or other formation that resonates with you.

**Crystals**:
Choose crystals that aid in ancestral communication, such as amethyst, clear quartz, and obsidian. Place these crystals on the altar or around the base of the mirror. Additional crystals, such as rose quartz or black tourmaline, can be placed around the altar to create a sacred geometry grid.

**Incense**:
Use incense that connects with the ancestral realm, such as sandalwood, frankincense, or myrrh. Light the incense before beginning your invocation to create a sacred atmosphere.

**Offerings**:
Prepare offerings for your ancestors, like flowers, fruits or breads, a small glass of water or wine, and a small dish of salt. An additional offering, such as a family heirloom, can also be placed on the altar to symbolize your lineage.

Ancestral Invocation:

I, (your name), descendant of (mention the names of any ancestors who play a significant role in your life or heritage), call upon the wise spirits of my lineage. 
I honor your sacrifices, your guidance, and your influence that flows through my blood.

Before this consecrated mirror, I cast a circle of protection and invite the ancestral energies to join me in sacred communion.

Ancient ones who came before, from near and far, I ask for your wisdom, your comfort, and your guidance. Illuminate the path before me, as you have so many times before.

As the flame of these candles burns bright, so, too, does my connection to the realm of ancestors. In their glow, I see your faces, I feel your presence, and I am humbled by your love.

With the power of these sacred crystals, incense, and offerings, I open the doors to the spirit realm, and welcome your knowledge and insight.

I give thanks and honor to my ancestors for the precious gift of life and the legacy they have woven for me.

May our connection to one another grow stronger and more profound as we walk the path of life together.

As it was, as it is, and as it shall be, forever and always. So mote it be.

After the invocation, sit quietly and meditate, focusing on the mirror and the flickering candlelight. Keep an open heart and mind, allowing the messages and guidance from your ancestors to come through. Close the ritual by thanking your ancestors for their presence and wisdom, and releasing their energy to continue their journey in the spiritual realm.

Remember to give gratitude and maintain your altar, keeping it clean and regularly changing the offerings. This will help further cement your connection with your ancestral spirits.
