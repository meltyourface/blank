excerpt: >
  As the full moon rises, face the scrying mirror and begin your incantation while focusing on the reflection of the luminescent orb in its surface. Explore your past traumas, engage with your shadow self, and invite the transmutative power of the full moon to mend your wounds from within. Gently release the pain and tension in your body through the mirror, expelling the dark energies as you breathe in the restorative power of lunar light.

To begin this Mirror Magick spell for healing past wounds, follow these steps:

1. **Cleansing and consecrating the black scrying mirror**:

- Before using the mirror, clean it with a soft cloth and a solution of water and a few drops of vinegar or witch hazel.
- Light a white candle and some incense (such as sage or palo santo) and let the smoke pass over the mirror while stating your intention to cleanse and consecrate it for healing work.
- Hold the mirror in your hands and visualize white light surrounding it, charging it with positive energy and your intention to tap into the unconscious mind for healing.

2. **Creating the ritual circle**:

- Choose a quiet, comfortable space to set up your ritual.
- Place a candle at each cardinal point (north, south, east, and west) to represent the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. You can use green, yellow, red, and blue candles for these points, respectively.
- Place healing crystals such as rose quartz, sodalite, and amethyst around the circle with herbs like lavender, chamomile, and rosemary to promote healing and forgiveness.
- Draw or trace a circle around the candles, crystals, and herbs with salt or a white cord to define your sacred space.

3. **Preparing the night-elixir**:

- Charge a container of water under the light of the full moon to capture its energy.
- Infuse the moonwater with healing botanicals such as calendula flowers, passionflower, and yarrow leaf.
- Allow the concoction to charge under the full moon before sealing and storing it for use during the ritual.

4. **Performing the ritual**:

- As the full moon rises, stand or sit facing the scrying mirror with the moon's reflection visible in its surface.
- Begin your incantation: "Lunar light, restore my sight. Relieve the pain of past's plight. Through this mirror, my soul ignites â€” healing the wounds of history's fights."
- While focusing on the moon's reflection, delve into your past traumas and confront your shadow self.
- Visualize the full moon's transformative energy flowing into your body, mending your wounds from within.
- Breathe out your pain and tension, releasing the dark energies through the mirror as you inhale the restorative lunar light.

5. **Concluding the ritual and post-ritual self-care**:

- Ground and center yourself by placing your hands on the ground or floor, feeling the Earth's energy merge with your own.
- Imbue the night-elixir with your intention to continue healing beyond the ritual, either by holding the bottle and visualizing your intention, or by stating it aloud.
- Use the potion during meditation or self-care practices to reinforce the healing process.
- Journal about the ritual experience, highlighting the progress you have made and your commitment to healing and personal growth through Mirror Magick.

By following this Mirror Magick spell, you will embark on a powerful journey of healing and transformation. Remember to be patient, forgiving, and compassionate with yourself as you continue this path to emotional restoration.
