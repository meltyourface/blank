## I. The Healing of Pausanias, 5th century BCE

This detailed narrative can be found in Plutarch's "Lives," specifically in the biography of Cimon, the Athenian general (Plutarch, Lives, Cimon 16.1-2). Pausanias, a Spartan general, suffered from an illness that afflicted him physically and emotionally. In an effort to seek relief, he ventured to Epidaurus, the sanctuary of Asclepios. After performing rituals and offering sacrifices, Pausanias slept inside the temple and began to dream, during which Asclepios appeared and removed the illness. Upon awakening, Pausanias was miraculously cured.

### II. The Incident of the Blind Man at the Sanctuary in Epidaurus, circa 390 BCE

The second healing account stems from Epidaurus, and is documented on one of the temple's inscriptions (IG IV 121). A blind man named Hermodicus traveled to the sanctuary of Asclepios to seek a cure for his condition. Asclepios instructed Hermodicus to sleep within the sacred temple, and the next morning, he restored the man's sight. Hermodicus left a votive offering at the temple as an expression of gratitude.

### III. Aelius Aristides' Sojourn at Pergamon, 2nd century CE

This healing narrative comes from "Sacred Tales," the writings of Aelius Aristides, a Roman orator (Aelius Aristides, Sacred Tales, 46-50). Aelius was suffering from debilitating health issues, and was advised by a local physician to visit the Asclepion of Pergamon, where he spent several years. While there, he had multiple visions of Asclepios, who provided him with instructions on how to heal himself through dietary changes, rituals, and rest. Eventually, Aelius was restored to health.

### IV. The Healing of Julius Caesar's Epilepsy

This narrative comes from a secondary source, Suetonius' "The Twelve Caesars" (Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Divus Julius 45). In this account, Julius Caesar sought divine assistance for his epilepsy, as the condition greatly affected his military and political pursuits. Although Asclepios was not explicitly mentioned in Suetonius' work, there are historical accounts indicating Caesar's visit to the Temple of Asclepios in Rome. Following this, his condition is said to have significantly improved.

### V. The Healing of Galeria's Childlessness, 4th century CE

The account of the Roman empress Galeria's infertility can be found in the works of Lactantius, an early Christian author (Lactantius, On the Deaths of the Persecutors, 35). After numerous failed attempts to conceive, Galeria turned to Asclepios in desperation. She visited the sanctuary at Epidaurus, seeking divine intervention. Upon returning home, Galeria miraculously conceived a child.

### VI. The Chronicle of Gregory of Tours, 6th century CE

The final account originates from the "History of the Franks" by Gregory of Tours (Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks, 5.31). A blind woman journeyed to the tomb of St. Martin to regain her sight. Following a vision of Asclepios, she washed her eyes in water that flowed from the tomb, and her eyesight was restored. While this account includes a Christian saint alongside the pagan god, it underscores the persistence of Asclepiosâ€™ healing abilities in the collective memory.

Comparative Analysis:

Several recurring themes are apparent among these accounts. Firstly, each case illustrates the need for the sufferer to actively seek Asclepios' intervention, often at his sacred sanctuaries. Secondly, dreams and visions commonly act as conduits for the healer's presence. Lastly, these miraculous events cemented Asclepios' legendary status in various time periods and cultures, asserting the lasting influence of his healing powers and the belief in divine intervention for physical and emotional ailments.
