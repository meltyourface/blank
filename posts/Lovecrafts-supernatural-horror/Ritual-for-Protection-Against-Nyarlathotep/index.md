## Title: The Shadowed Rite of Pnakotos

**Purpose**: To protect oneself from the malignant influence of Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos - a shapeshifting, deceptive malevolent entity in H.P. Lovecraft's cosmos.

Required Materials:

1. Fragment of an Elder Sign - A broken piece of the five-pointed, star-shaped symbol designed to ward off the Great Old Ones.
2. Powder of Ibn-Ghazi - A mystic concoction known for revealing the unseen.
3. Nacrifis Crystal - A rare, translucent crystal found deep within the earth, imbued with powerful energies capable of bending time and space.
4. Essence of the Black Lotus - A pungent, dangerous elixir derived from the rare black lotus plant, used to open the mind's eye.
5. Sacrificial dagger - An ancient, ceremonial blade decorated with cryptic symbols and stained from past rites.
6. Chalk - To draw the Umbral Pentacle of Nodens on the ground.

Ritual Steps:

1. Locate a secluded and preferably subterranean location with deep connections to the eldritch energies of the cosmos.
2. Using the chalk, draw the Umbral Pentacle of Nodens on the ground. This five-cornered figure represents the interlocking cycles of time, space, and consciousness, and serves as a conduit for cosmic energies.
3. Inscribe the infamous Yellow Sign around the central node of the Umbral Pentacle, a symbol of despair to attract the Crawling Chaos, yet to bind him temporarily.
4. Place the fragment of the Elder Sign at each corner of the Umbral Pentacle, anchoring the ritual circle with an eternal cosmic barrier.
5. Mix the Powder of Ibn-Ghazi with the Essence of the Black Lotus in an earthen vessel, stirring until a thick, scentless gas begins to rise. This blend will make the shapeshifting Nyarlathotep visible and immobile, loosening his grip on reality.
6. Ignite the Nacrifis Crystal using the Sacrificial dagger, imbuing the crystal with the eternal struggle between chaos and order. The crystal will absorb the eldritch energies within the circle and strengthen the protective barrier.
7. **Chant the dreaded Invocation of the Outer Spheres**: "N'gah m'latgh ngah'ni Y'ha-nthlei, syha'h nglui ivhro'b R'lyeh, vulgtm llll n'ghft sll'ha y-orr'e, ngeb wgah'n y'hah ar'chatalyth." This powerful invocation will summon the attention of the Great Old Ones and the cosmic pantheon.
8. With the summoning and binding complete, proceed to address the Crawling Chaos directly, asserting dominance and boldly stating the desire to be protected from his malignant influence.

Adaptations and risks:
Depending on the malevolence of the entity, variations in required materials and ritual steps might be necessary. For a lesser entity, a more straightforward incantation with fewer eldritch components or a less intricate Umbral Pentacle may suffice. However, for particularly powerful entities, additional symbols and precautions should be utilized, such as incorporating the dreaded Blasphemous Glyphs of Y'qaa or summoning the protective spirits of the Elder Ones.

Undertaking such a ritual comes with grave risks. The slightest mistake could result in attracting the full wrath of the malevolent entity or even invoking the ire of a greater Great Old One. Tread wisely, sorcerer, lest your ambition betrays you into the very shadow of supernatural horror from which you sought refuge in the first place.
