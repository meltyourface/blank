To fully grasp the evolving role of the Necromancer within the framework of occultism, it is essential to examine historical, philosophical, and cultural contexts that have shaped the development and practice of necromancy throughout the ages. By delving into these various influences, an initiate can develop a comprehensive and balanced approach to practicing necromancy, acknowledging its diverse roots while adapting its principles to contemporary times.

Historical Context:

1. **Ancient practices**: Historically, the art of necromancy was practiced in various ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Greece, and Rome. These civilizations believed in communicating with the dead for gaining knowledge about the future or seeking advice about important matters. The Egyptians, for instance, had rites concerning the dead, while the Greeks held elaborate rituals to summon and consult the spirits of the deceased, as detailed in Homer's Odyssey.

2. **Medieval Europe**: During the Middle Ages, necromancy became associated with darker practices and was often considered as a form of dark magic, conjuring evil spirits or demons. The infamous grimoires like the Key of Solomon and the Lesser Key of Solomon detailed rituals and formulas for summoning spirits and performing other supernatural activities. Christian and Islamic theologians of the time generally condemned necromancy as a form of heresy or blasphemy, and practitioners were often persecuted.

Philosophical Context:

1. **Dualism**: Many traditions embracing necromancy are rooted in the belief in dualism, the separation of the physical and spiritual planes of existence. In these belief systems, the dead continue to exist in a spiritual realm, from which they can communicate with or influence the living. Necromancy, in this context, is the ability to bridge the gap between the two realms and facilitate communication with the dead.

2. **Morality**: Throughout history, necromancy has been subject to moral scrutiny. While some practitioners have viewed the communication with the dead as a sacred and respectful practice, others have seen it as a violation of the natural order or an attempt to usurp divine authority by seeking knowledge meant to remain hidden. These debates have shaped various necromantic practices, leading to their divergence and development over time.

Cultural Context:

1. **East Asian practices**: In China and Japan, ancestor worship and communication with the dead play a pivotal role in religious and cultural customs. In these contexts, necromancy or ancestral communication is a key aspect of daily life and spiritual practice.

2. **African and African Diaspora cultures**: Practices in African and Caribbean cultures, such as Voodoo, Santeria, and Obeah, involve communication with ancestors and spirits of the dead. These belief systems have influenced the way necromancy is practiced and understood within these communities.

3. **Western Occultism and Modern Revivals**: Contemporary Occultism has seen the revival of various strands of necromantic practice, with movements such as the Order of the Golden Dawn and various Chaos Magick traditions adapting and interpreting ancient necromantic knowledge for modern audiences.

In summary, by thoroughly examining various historical, philosophical, and cultural contexts that have informed the development and practice of necromancy, an initiate will be equipped with a deeper understanding of the role of the necromancer in occultism. This understanding can help tailor a holistic and balanced personal practice that honors the diverse roots of necromancy and respects its ethical and moral implications while adapting it to contemporary times and personal beliefs. Key themes to consider include ancient customs, medieval associations, dualism, moral debates, and the significance of regional cultural practices in shaping and informing the art of necromancy.
