excerpt: Perform a comprehensive assessment and dissection of the impact of Greek Neoplatonism on the development and practice of Western necromancy, particularly exploring the infusion of Neoplatonic metaphysics, cosmological theories, and vitalism in the context of conjuring the dead and manipulating undead energies. Delve into the works of prominent Neoplatonist thinkers and how their ideologies and frameworks were channeled to shape necromantic ritualistic practices, communication methodologies, and the sequential evolution of necromancy in Western occultism. Conclude by envisioning potential applications of these ancient influences in contemporary necromantic engagements.

The practice of Necromancy, as a branch of Western occultism, has been deeply influenced by the philosophical school of Greek Neoplatonism. Neoplatonism, a philosophical system that developed in the 3rd century CE, is largely credited to the works of Plotinus, with other prominent thinkers such as Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus. Its metaphysical, cosmological, and vitalist concepts play a significant role in the historical and intellectual context of necromantic practices, particularly in the conjuring of the dead and the manipulation of undead energies.

Neoplatonism revolves around the concept of emanation, where the divine One or ultimate reality continuously emanates lesser realities or beings, descending from a realm of pure idea or spirituality to one of materiality. This hierarchical, emanative structure of the cosmos has significant implications for the way necromancy is structured and practiced. By emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things, necromancers could draw upon Neoplatonic principles to forge spiritual bonds with the deceased and the realms of the undead.

Neoplatonic metaphysics also influenced necromancy through its understanding of the human soul, which was considered divine and was believed to be capable of returning to its source, the One, after the body's death. As such, necromancers developed rituals and practices designed to facilitate communication with disembodied souls, using the Neoplatonic framework of hierarchies and emanations.

Moreover, the Neoplatonic concept of the World Soul, which permeates and connects all things in existence, played a central role in shaping necromantic practices. By tapping into this universal force, necromancers could ostensibly communicate with the spirits of the dead and harness their powers to manipulate undead energies.

One key aspect of Neoplatonism that contributed significantly to the evolution of necromancy was the establishment of theurgy, the magic practiced by Iamblichus. Theurgy emphasized divine invocations and communication with celestial hierarchies in order to achieve spiritual ascent and union with the divine. In this context, necromancers began blending theurgy with traditional necromantic practices, paving the way for the incorporation of a range of divine symbols, talismans, and amulets in their rituals.

Another prominent Neoplatonist thinker, Proclus, significantly influenced the practice of necromancy through his works on theurgy, cosmology, and metaphysics. His emphasis on the role of divine intermediaries, such as angels, demons, and elemental spirits, provided the theoretical groundwork for the development of necromantic practices that involved summoning and controlling such entities.

Transitions in Western occultism, such as the Hermeticism and Renaissance magic, continued to be shaped by Neoplatonic ideas, especially in terms of cosmology, spirituality, and the role of magic in human affairs. Thus, the influence of Neoplatonism on necromancy continued to be felt throughout history.

In the contemporary context, Neoplatonic influences on necromancy continue to inspire and guide modern practitioners. Modern necromantic practitioners may harness Neoplatonic frameworks to explore the dimensions of the soul, the structure of the cosmos, and the relationships between the living and the dead. By engaging with Neoplatonic ideologies, today's necromancers seek to evolve and adapt ancient necromantic practices, summoning and manipulating undead energies in pursuit of spiritual, magical, and intellectual development.
