## Esoteric Influences and Occult Aspects within Joseph Smith and Mormonism

Introduction

Joseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) or Mormonism, was greatly influenced by esoteric and occult philosophies of his time. As a result, Mormonism is rich with mystical symbolism, rituals, and beliefs, combining Christian theology with esoteric principles. In this section, we shall explore the key occult influences and aspects within Mormonism that have shaped its foundation and practices.

Occult Symbols and their Significance

Mormonism is replete with esoteric symbols that encompass deeper meanings and spiritual interpretations. **Let's look at some of the most prominent symbols**:

1. ****The All-Seeing Eye****: Also known as the Eye of Providence, this symbol represents the watchful presence of God and divine guidance. Found in numerous LDS temples and artwork, it symbolizes discernment, wisdom, and divine protection.

2. ****The Beehive****: The beehive symbolizes community, harmony, and cooperation, reflecting the ideal of LDS: to work together in building the Kingdom of God on earth. The beehive has become a significant emblem in Mormon culture, representing industriousness and unity among its members.

3. ****The Sun, Moon, and Stars****: Celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, often found in LDS temple architecture, allude to the degrees of glory in the afterlife â€“ the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms, respectively. These celestial bodies also serve as reminders that God's children are to progress and ascend toward higher states of existence, like the sun rises towards the zenith in the sky.

Rituals and Hidden Knowledge

Mormonism incorporates numerous rituals with deep esoteric roots, embodying ancient hidden knowledge and spiritual principles. Among these rituals, the Endowment Ceremony and Sealing practice are significant, conveying profound mystical meanings and experiences for initiates.

1. ****The Endowment Ceremony****: This ritual, performed in LDS temples, consists of a series of ceremonial instructions, covenants, and ordinances that signify an endowment or gift of divine power, authority, and protection. Participants are taught about the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and are symbolically guided through a journey of spiritual progression. Occult elements such as ritual garments, anointing with oil, Masonic handshakes, and veiled faces have their origins in ancient mystery religions and are incorporated into the ceremony.

2. ****Sealing****: The sealing practice binds families together for eternity, ensuring a continuation of relationships in the afterlife. It is based on the belief that special priesthood authority can "seal" marriages and families through sacred ordinances. The sealing ceremony reflects the idea of eternal marriage and the boundless nature of love and life.

The Angel Moroni and Sacred Texts

The Angel Moroni, who is said to have appeared to Joseph Smith, is a key figure in the foundation of Mormonism. Identified as a resurrected ancient prophet, Moroni served as a divine messenger, imparting hidden knowledge and teachings through the Book of Mormon, a sacred text in the LDS faith. The visitation of Angel Moroni exemplifies the connection between the spiritual realm and earthly life in Mormonism.

The Book of Mormon, along with other LDS scriptures, has several esoteric elements, including an emphasis on spiritual ascension, divine wisdom, and mystical experiences. It also contains esoteric tropes from the broader early 19th-century milieu Joseph Smith lived in, including the discovery of buried records, angelic visitations, seer stones, and ancient American mysticism.

Conclusion

The esoteric and occult aspects within Joseph Smith and Mormonism have contributed significantly to the spiritual richness and complexity of the faith. From esoteric symbols and rituals to hidden knowledge embedded in the foundation of the religion, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints remains a fascinating study for those seeking to delve into the mystical elements underpinning religious belief systems.
