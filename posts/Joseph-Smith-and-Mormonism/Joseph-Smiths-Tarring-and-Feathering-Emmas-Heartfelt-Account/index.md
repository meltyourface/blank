March 6, 1832

Dearest Diary,

Today has been a day marked with much suffering and anguish, yet also filled with undying faith in our Heavenly Father and His restored gospel. The events that took place this evening have tried my heart and soul to its very core. Oh, the unspeakable horrors that my beloved husband Joseph has endured for the sake of the Lord's work!

Last night, a group of evil and ruthless men, driven by their hatred for the Church and its divine truths, descended upon our home in Hiram, Ohio. These vile men dragged Joseph from the comfort of our abode and subjected him to a brutal and malicious act of violence. They stripped him naked, covered his body in tar and feathers, and left him to suffer in the bitter cold.

As I tended to his wounds, my heart ached not only for my husband but for all of our brothers and sisters in the faith. The early days of the Church have been fraught with challenges - persecution, betrayal, and hardship - yet our fellow Saints have remained steadfast in their faith and devotion. We have been empowered by the strength of the Holy Spirit and the convictions of our hearts to forge onward in the face of adversity.

In the midst of this turmoil, however, I must admit that I have grappled with questions and doubts. I have sometimes asked myself whether we have brought these troubles upon ourselves, whether we could have done more to quell the animosity and mend the fractures in our small community of believers. But as I have prayed for guidance and peace, a comforting assurance has surged within me that my husband's calling as the Lord's prophet is divine, and the challenges we face are a testament to the power and truthfulness of this great work.

In the aftermath of this harrowing ordeal, Joseph has received revelation and prophecy from the Lord on how to comfort and guide the Saints. As he imparts God's wisdom unto our brethren, I have watched in awe as even the most downtrodden among us have been lifted by the weight of their burdens, and their resolve to build the kingdom of God on Earth has only been bolstered.

We have been promised that trials and tribulations will inevitably come, but as Joseph often reminds me, "No unhallowed hand can stop this work from progressing." Having witnessed my husband's unflagging fidelity to his calling, and the unwavering commitment of our fellow Saints, I have no doubts that we are at the vanguard of a remarkable endeavor, divinely ordained by our Heavenly Father.

And so, with my faith renewed and my spirit energized, I press forward in this great and glorious work. Despite the trials that lie ahead – the fiery darts of the adversary and the pain we might yet endure – I am wholly committed to by Joseph's side, standing as his loving partner in this sacred mission that the Lord has so magnanimously entrusted unto us.

With a steadfast heart and a resolute mind,
Emma Smith
