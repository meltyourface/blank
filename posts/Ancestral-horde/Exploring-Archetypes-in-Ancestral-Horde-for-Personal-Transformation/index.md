In order to address the knowledge challenge, we must first define the relevant concepts and establish the context we are working within. The ancestral horde refers to a social group formed by families or tribes bound by shared ancestry. In this scenario, we are exploring this concept within the framework of occult studies and practices.

The occult, derived from the Latin term occultus (meaning hidden or secret), refers to the study and practice of techniques towards gaining access to hidden knowledge and transformative power. These practices often involve ritualistic methods or understanding esoteric concepts. Individuation, a term popularized by the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, represents the psychological process of integrating and reconciling the conscious and unconscious aspects of oneâ€™s self, ultimately leading to a more complete and self-actualized individual.

Having established these concepts, let us now examine the roles and relationships within an ancestral horde in an occult context, and decipher how incorporating these archetypes into one's spiritual practice can contribute to personal transformation and the process of individuation.

1. Ancestral Roles and Relationships: In an ancestral horde, various roles and relationships can be distinguished, such as leaders, shamans, healers, hunters, gatherers, and elders. These roles are interconnected, relying on mutual collaboration and support. 

In an occult context, such roles may manifest as metaphysical archetypes, or symbolic representations of different aspects of ourselves, our society, and the forces that drive them. By engaging with these archetypes, practitioners can access hidden aspects of their own psyche and gain valuable insights and wisdom passed down through the generations.

**Example**: The shaman figure may serve as an archetype to examine the boundaries of spiritual wisdom and the bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. By channeling this archetype, one may develop a more extensive understanding of spirituality and the interconnectedness of various forces in our lives.

2. Personal Transformation through Archetypes: Integrating these archetypes and the wisdom conferred by the ancestral horde serves as a crucial pillar in the process of individuation. As individuals explore and embody these archetypes, they confront the suppressed aspects of their psyche, often resulting in personal transformation and growth.

**Example**: The warrior archetype could represent a person's capacity for assertiveness and resilience, which when embraced, may empower individuals to overcome adversity and become more self-reliant.

3. Individuation via the Ancestral Horde: By harnessing the wisdom and values of the ancestral horde through occult practices, individuals can embark on a journey towards individuation. This process involves reconciling seemingly conflicting aspects of the self and achieving a mature, integrated personality.

**Example**: Engaging with the sage archetype may lead practitioners to a more profound understanding of life's complexities, ultimately allowing for the harmonization of dualistic aspects within the self, such as reason and emotion, and nurturing the development of a balanced and holistic persona.

In conclusion, the roles and relationships within an ancestral horde in an occult context hold a wealth of potential for personal transformation and the process of individuation. By working with these archetypes, individuals can tap into the inherited wisdom and resilience embodied by their ancestors. This process encourages personal growth by confronting and reconciling inner conflicts to achieve a mature and integrated sense of self. By invoking the symbolism and lessons learned from the ancestral horde, we can continue to evolve our spiritual practices and continually strive toward self-realization.
