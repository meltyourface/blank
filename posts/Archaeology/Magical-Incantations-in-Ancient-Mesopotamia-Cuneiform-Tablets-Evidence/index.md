Cuneiform tablets provide evidence of the use of magical incantations and rituals in ancient Mesopotamia.

**Explanation**:
Ancient Mesopotamia, a region historically considered to be the cradle of civilization, was home to some powerful ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians. It is well-documented that these civilizations had a rich history of magical practices, religious rituals, and occult beliefs. Cuneiform tablets are among the primary sources of evidence supporting the prevalence of such practices in ancient Mesopotamia.

Cuneiform is one of the earliest known systems of writing, initially developed by the Sumerians around 3400 BCE. This writing system was later adopted and modified by other Mesopotamian cultures. Cuneiform tablets, typically made of clay, often contain inscriptions of religious texts, rituals, incantations, and magical spells.

Many cuneiform tablets have been discovered that provide evidence of the use of magical incantations and rituals in ancient Mesopotamia. These texts reveal the practice of protective magic, curse-inducing spells, rituals for invoking the deities, and methods for warding off evil spirits, among other things. Specifically, the Maqlu (Burning) text is a series of incantations and rituals intended to combat evil spirits and dispel witchcraft, while the Shurpu (Burning) series contains incantations meant to appease the gods and expel negative influences.

It is worth noting that the other statements in the question are either partially or entirely inaccurate:

1. **Excavation of ritual sites often reveals artifacts that were intentionally buried for future divinatory purposes**: While it is true that excavations may uncover artifacts related to esoteric practices, it would be incorrect to generalize that artifacts were buried exclusively for "future divinatory purposes." Many artifacts are discovered as a result of various factors, such as cultural and ritualistic practices, burials, disasters, or simply the passage of time that eventually leads to the artifacts being buried and preserved.

2. Knowledge of ley lines, powerful geomantic lines of spiritual energy, was only known by more recent, Western occultists: Ley lines are an esoteric concept that emerged in the West in the early 20th century, but the idea of lines of spiritual energy connecting sacred sites has existed in various cultures throughout history. For example, in ancient China, the concept of dragon lines corresponds closely to the idea of ley lines, demonstrating that this concept was not exclusively known to recent Western occultists.

3. **There is no concrete archaeological evidence to support the existence of ancient civilizations using occult practices**: This statement is incorrect, as there exists plenty of evidence of ancient civilizations engaging in occult practices, notably through cuneiform tablets, artifacts, and the ruins of sacred sites.
