To develop a charm that magnetizes wealth and abundance, we shall call upon the ancient wisdom of the Druidic college, their profound knowledge of organic elements, and the sacred geometry that pervades their teachings. This charm will be a harmonious blend of natural stones, enchanted botanicals, and revered animal totems, all arranged to harness and direct the power of wealth and abundance.

Materials Required:

1. **Three natural stones**: Green Aventurine (for opportunity and prosperity), Citrine (for manifestation and personal will), and Pyrite (for wealth and good fortune).
2. **Enchanted botanicals**: Bay Laurel leaves (for success and protection), Chamomile flowers (for abundance and growth), and Irish Moss (for financial luck).
3. **Animal totems**: The Stag (for abundance), the Salmon (for wisdom), and the Bee (for community and wealth).
4. A small wooden box or a leather pouch to hold the charm.
5. Paper (preferably handmade with natural fibers) and natural ink (such as blackberry ink) to draw the Celtic symbols.

**Instructions**:

1. Begin by cleansing and consecrating the materials. This can be done by exposing them to the light of a full moon, smudging with sage, or employing any other purification method in line with Druidic practices.

2. Engrave or paint the wooden box or leather pouch with Druidic symbols, such as the Triskele (for progress and personal growth), the Awen (for spiritual growth and divine guidance), or the Triquetra (for unity and interconnectedness). These symbols will further empower the charm.

3. Arrange the stones, enchanted botanicals, and animal totems in a geometric pattern that mirrors the sacred Celtic spiral, as this symbolizes the flow of energy and will magnify the charm's potency. Place the Green Aventurine at the center, surrounded by the Citrine and Pyrite. Position the botanicals around the stones, followed by the animal totems.

4. On the paper, draw three sigils that represent wealth, abundance, and prosperity. These sigils should be based on ancient Celtic lore and can incorporate the Ogham, an early medieval alphabet used by Druids for divination. As you draw each sigil, focus your energy on its intended purpose.

5. Place the sigils in the box or pouch, upon the geometric arrangement of stones, botanicals, and animal totems. Seal the box or pouch, envisioning the charm being infused with the energy of wealth and abundance.

6. Hold the charm in your hands and meditate on your intention, feeling the influence of the Druidic tale of the "Cauldron of Abundance," which overflowed with wealth, prosperity, and sustenance for all.

7. Place the charm in the northwestern part of your home or workspace, as this represents the area of wealth and abundance in the ancient Druidic directional system.

As the charm becomes a permanent fixture in your living space, it will continually attract wealth and abundance, empowered by the harmonious combination of natural elements, sacred geometry, and ancient Celtic wisdom.
