1. Invocation of a Patron Deity

For the expulsion of an undesirable spirit or malevolent entity, the chosen patron deity to invoke for assistance is Hecate, the Greek goddess of witchcraft, crossroads, and necromancy. Hecate's expertise in commanding spirits and traversing the realms between the living and the dead make her an ideal ally in banishing the targeted entity.

To call upon Hecate for assistance, a small altar adorned with symbolic offerings such as keys, daggers, and images of the goddess must be placed within the ritual space. **An invocation to Hecate can be recited**:

"Great Hecate, Goddess of might,
Guide me through this rite tonight.
Lend me your power, wisdom, and might,
Help me banish this spirit from sight."

2. Creation and Consecration of a Sigil

To create a sigil representing the essence of the targeted spirit or force, utilize a combination of personal artistic skill and intention. Draw a symbol that visually encapsulates the essence of the entity, infusing your understanding of its origin and purpose into the design.

Once the sigil is drawn, it must be consecrated to charge it with your intention. Light a black candle and anoint the sigil with oil or blood, whispering your intent. Pass the sigil through the flame of the candle to seal its power.

3. Esoteric Implements

The following implements are required for the expulsion ritual:

- A ritualistic dagger for directing energy.
- Ceremonial robes to enhance the practitioner's connection to the occult.
- A circle of salt to encase the ritual area and protect against retaliation.
- Graveyard dirt, collected from a consecrated burial ground.
- Black candles to represent the banishing of the negative entity.
- Incense, specifically chosen for banishing, such as dragon's blood or sage.

4. Chants and Incantations

Throughout the ritual, the following incantations can be recited to strengthen the practitioner's power and weaken the metaphysical bonds of the targeted entity:

"I call upon the power within,
From Hecate's grace, the banishing begins.

Forces of light, hear my decree,
Expel this dark spirit, set this space free.

By fire, earth, water, and air,
I command thee, dark force, to disappear."

5. Preparatory Actions and Purification

Before commencing the ritual, the ceremonial space must be purified to ensure unhindered flow of ethereal energies. Set up a protective circle of salt, surrounding the area where the ritual will take place. Light the banishing incense and waft it around the ritual space, envisioning an impenetrable barrier forming against negative forces.

6. Step-by-Step Ritual Process

1. Wear the ceremonial robes and prepare the ritual space according to the preparatory actions detailed above.
2. Place the sigil at the center of the salt circle and arrange the black candles equidistant around the sigil.
3. Light the candles, starting from the north and moving clockwise.
4. Invoke Hecate with the incantation provided, welcoming her into the ritual space.
5. With the ritual dagger, draw a line of graveyard dirt around the sigil, reinforcing the barrier.
6. Anoint yourself with the oil or blood and recite the chants and incantations to evoke the expulsion.
7. Envision the spirit or entity being captured and bound within the sigil, its power diminished and controlled.
8. Burn the sigil in one of the candle flames, declaring the spirit banished from this plane of existence.
9. Close the ritual by expressing gratitude to Hecate and releasing her from the space.
10. Extinguish the candles as a symbol of the completed work and permanently sealed from return.

By following these steps and maintaining a focused intention, the expulsion of the malevolent entity or undesirable spirit will be successfully enacted using the power of Black magic and the assistance of the invoked patron deity, Hecate.
