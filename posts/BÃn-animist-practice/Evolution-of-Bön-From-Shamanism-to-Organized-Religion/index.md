The Evolution of Bön Animist Practices: A Comprehensive Timeline

1. Prehistoric Shamanism (circa 18,000 - 12,000 BCE)
- Earliest shamanic practices in the region that later became Tibet.
- Artifacts, cave paintings, and oral narratives suggest animistic beliefs and practices.

2. Proto-Bön (circa 12,000 - 900 BCE)
- Emergence of rituals, symbols, and cosmology that later formed the basis of Bön.
- First appearance of key mythological figures, including Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche, the founder of Bön.

3. Early Shen (circa 900 - 140 BCE)
- Distinct Bön tradition begins to take shape, characterized by shamanic healing practices, soul retrieval, exorcism, and rituals for the dead.
- Bön practitioners called Shen, who were believed to harness the power of spirits to heal, protect, and ensure success in various endeavors.

4. Yungdrung Bön (circa 140 BCE - 7th century CE)
- Influence of neighboring cultures, including the integration of elements from Indo-Aryan and proto-Buddhist belief systems.
- Emergence of teachings on ethics, meditation, cosmology, and compassionate non-violent practices.
- The establishment of temples and monastic institutions marks the transition from a primarily shamanic practice to an organized religion.
- Development of distinct lineages within Bön, including Zhang Zhung Meri, Gyer Bön, Lhu Bön, and Bum Bön.

5. Interaction with Buddhism (7th - 14th century CE)
- The rise of Buddhism in Tibet and its interaction with local Bön traditions.
- Influence of Buddhist principles and practices, such as tantra, yoga, and the concept of emptiness, on Bön thought.
- Bön adopts several Buddhist deities, transforming them into Bön-specific protectors and allies.
- The formation of pantheon leaders including Sipe Gyalmo, a central Bön protector deity.
- The emergence of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) practices in both Bön and Buddhist lineages, highlighting the interconnectedness between the two.

6. "Old" and "New" Bön (14th century - present)
- Bön is split into two distinct schools: Old and New Bön.
- Old Bön continues the shamanic healing traditions and rituals based on indigenous knowledge, while New Bön adopts more Buddhist elements and philosophical doctrines.
- The lineage of New Bön is traced back to Welse Tenzin (1280-1327), Yundrung Nyima (1284-?) and Rinchen Lodro (1293-1376), whose teachings led to the codification and reorganization of the Bön canon.
- Preservation and dissemination of Bön knowledge through the establishment of major monastic institutions, including Menri Monastery and Triten Norbu Dargyé Ling in India, as well as the Ligmincha Institute in the United States.

In summary, Bön animistic practices have evolved over time, influenced by a variety of cultural, spiritual, and regional factors. From its shamanic origins to its current manifestations, Bön has continued to adapt and maintain its unique identity, while also embracing elements from neighboring traditions. It remains an essential thread in the tapestry of esoteric, occult, and animistic practices found throughout various epochs in human history.
