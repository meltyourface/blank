The Bön animist tradition, which predates Buddhism in Tibet and is rooted in the ancient culture of Zhangzhung, is a complex and multifaceted spiritual practice that aims to balance the practitioner's connection with both the natural world and the unseen realms. Central to this practice are the various mudras (symbolic hand gestures) and body postures employed in its rituals, which serve to establish a powerful connection between the practitioner, the deities they invoke, and the spiritual energies they seek to harness.

Historically, mudras in the Bön animist tradition have evolved alongside the various subsects and regional influences that have shaped the broader Bön practice. For example, the incorporation of Hindu and Buddhist elements into Bön has contributed to the development of mudras that share similarities with those found in those traditions. However, Bön mudras are distinguishable by their unique esoteric meanings, which are deeply rooted in the rich animistic beliefs and practices of the tradition.

The practical applications of mudras in Bön animist practice are manifold, with each gesture serving a distinct purpose in relation to the spiritual aims of the practitioner, the deities being invoked, and the energies being harnessed. Mudras help practitioners to create a physical and mental focal point, facilitating the process of establishing a connection with the deities and the spiritual realms. Additionally, mudras play a crucial role in channeling energies within the practitioner's body, mind, and spirit, and are integral to achieving spiritual advancement on the path to enlightenment.

Let us now examine three specific Bön mudras and their contributions to the richness of Bön ceremonies.

1. Jnana Mudra: In this mudra, the practitioner touches the tips of the thumb and index finger together, forming a circle. This gesture symbolizes the unity of wisdom (symbolized by the thumb) and the relative or conventional world (symbolized by the index finger). In Bön animist practice, the Jnana Mudra helps to generate an awareness of interconnectedness and brings the practitioner's understanding of the natural world into harmony with the wisdom of the deities.

2. Anjali Mudra: Often referred to as the "gesture of reverence or adoration," the Anjali Mudra involves bringing the palms together at heart level. This mudra is used extensively in Bön culture in both religious and secular contexts as a gesture of respect, greeting, or salutation, and it is especially significant in rituals invoking deities and venerating spiritual teachers. By performing this mudra, the practitioner embodies the qualities of devotion, openness, and humility, which are essential for establishing a connection with the divine.

3. Dhyani Mudra: This mudra, adapted from Buddhist practice, involves placing the hands in the lap, with the right hand resting on top of the left, and the thumbs touching at the tips. The Dhyani Mudra represents a state of deep meditation and spiritual receptivity, and is often employed during meditation sessions to facilitate connection with inner wisdom and the spiritual realms. In Bön animist practice, this mudra aids in the absorption of teachings and energetic transmissions as practitioners endeavor to align themselves with the path to enlightenment.

Contemporary Bön practitioners continue to adapt these traditional mudras, as well as other ancient gestures and postures, to accommodate the modern spiritual needs and aspirations of individuals in a rapidly changing world. Through careful study and cultivation of these ancient techniques, practitioners of Bön animism strive to maintain the potency and relevance of these traditional gestures while ensuring their capacity to serve as powerful tools for spiritual awakening and transformation.
