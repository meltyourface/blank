To thoroughly address this knowledge challenge, we will first need to define and understand some key concepts:

1. Metaphysical concepts of duality and polarity
2. The nature of astral planes in occult cosmology
3. Intermediary spirits and their role in spiritual growth and transformation

Metaphysical Concepts of Duality and Polarity:
In the realm of metaphysics, duality is the concept that pairs of opposites or contradictions form the basic structure of existence. Polarity is an extension of duality, representing the two extremes of a single 'force' or 'energy' spectrum, such as the poles of a magnet. These principles are found in various spiritual and philosophical systems, like Taoism's Yin and Yang, the Hermetic principle of correspondence, and even in modern scientific frameworks like particle physics.

The Nature of Astral Planes in Occult Cosmology:
Astral planes refer to the existence of multiple, coexisting levels or dimensions of reality, unseen by the physical senses, that represent the spectrum of consciousness and other energetic manifestations. In theosophy and other occult teachings, the astral planes serve as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms, and are inhabited by various entities and forces. It is widely believed that these planes can be accessed and explored by the human consciousness through practices like meditation, astral projection, and ritual.

Intermediary Spirits and Their Role in Spiritual Growth and Transformation:
Intermediary spirits are entities or beings that exist within the astral planes and serve as intermediaries between humankind and higher planes of consciousness. They can act as guides, teachers, protectors, and sources of inspiration or creativity. These spirits can be summoned or communicated with through various occult practices, such as ritual, evocation, channeling, and invocation of different deities and symbolic archetypes.

Now, let's discuss the connection between these concepts and how they contribute to the understanding and practical application of intermediary spirits for spiritual growth and transformation.

The principles of duality and polarity play an essential role in understanding the nature of human experience and the cosmic framework within which intermediary spirits operate. By recognizing the existence of opposites and the dynamic balance between polar forces, we can appreciate how intermediary spirits exemplify and embody the expression of these forces, often manifesting as complex and multifaceted beings. This enables us to engage with these spirits in a more meaningful way, perceiving their lessons and guidance in the wider context of spiritual development and karmic progression.

Appreciating the nature of astral planes in occult cosmology provides an essential foundation for interacting with and utilizing the assistance of intermediary spirits. It's through the exploration of these subtle realms and the development of our psychic and intuitive faculties that we can access the wisdom, power, and guidance of these beings. By understanding the reality and qualities of these other worlds, as well as the entities that inhabit them, we can reach beyond the mundane aspects of existence and tap into the broader spectrum of spiritual truths that lie within the multi-dimensional nature of our reality.

In practical terms, the knowledge and application of these concepts enable us to harness the power of intermediary spirits, their teachings, and their guidance meaningfully. Through studying and applying occult techniques and cultivating a deeper understanding of duality, polarity, and the astral planes, we create a conducive environment for the growth and transformation facilitated by these spiritual entities.

In summary, the metaphysical concepts of duality and polarity, along with the nature of astral planes in occult cosmology, form a foundational framework for understanding and utilizing intermediary spirits. By acknowledging the existence of different dimensions, polar forces, and entities that serve as bridges between the realms, we open ourselves up to the wealth of guidance, wisdom, and transformative energies available from these beings. As a result, our spiritual growth and transformation can be significantly accelerated by leveraging these esoteric principles and their applications in our lives.
