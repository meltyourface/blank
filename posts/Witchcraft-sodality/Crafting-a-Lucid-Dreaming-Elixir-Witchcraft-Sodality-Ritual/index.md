Task: Craft an elixir that enhances lucid dreaming within the Witchcraft sodality using essential oils and arcane ingredients.

1. Astrological Window for Optimal Potion Potency:
To ensure optimal potency of the elixir, the crafting ceremony should be performed during the waxing gibbous moon as it approaches its fullest state. Additionally, take note of the planetary alignments and focus on Neptune (the planet associated with dreams and psychic experiences) in a harmonious aspect with the Moon, such as a trine or a sextile.

2. Selection of Essential Oils:
The six essential oils chosen for their entheogenic properties and historical association with dream enhancement or psychic experiences are:

- Mugwort Oil: Enhances divination and psychic awareness.
- Lavender Oil: Encourages deep relaxation for more vivid and accessible dreams.
- Clary Sage Oil: An oil that promotes lucid dreaming and dream recall.
- Chamomile Oil: Calms the mind and encourages peaceful sleep, necessary for entering a lucid dream state.
- Jasmine Oil: Opens the third eye and aids in accessing spiritual states.
- Sandalwood Oil: Enhances meditation and opens the deeper realms of consciousness.

3. Incantations and Sigils:

- Create a sigil that incorporates symbols for the Moon, Neptune, and the dream realm. This will act as a focal point during the ritual to reinforce the purpose and intention.
- Compose an incantation to invoke potent spiritual energies, such as:

 "By waxing Moon and Neptune's call,
 Guide my dreams, both great and small.
 Elixir brew and potion bind,
 A world of dreams, my mind shall find.
 In lucid realms, I'll wander free,
 And in full awareness, I shall be."

4. Step-by-Step Process:

a) Begin by creating a sacred space in which to craft the elixir, such as placing candles and symbols around a central working space to represent the elements (air, fire, water, earth).
b) Draw a witch's circle around the working area, using salt or chalk, to reinforce the spiritual energies being invoked.
c) Light incense that complements the chosen essential oils (such as sandalwood or lavender).
d) Invoke the elements, the Moon, and Neptune, and ask for their guidance and assistance in crafting the elixir.
e) Carefully blend the six essential oils in a glass container, empowering each with your focused intention for enhanced lucid dreaming.
f) Hold the ritual athame above the elixir, and channel energy from the circle, the elements, and the celestial bodies into the mixture.
g) Use divination tools such as tarot cards or a pendulum to guide the process and determine when the mixture is imbued with the desired energies.
h) Close the circle and give thanks to the invoked powers for their assistance.

5. Employing the Enchanted Lucid Dreaming Elixir:

a) Anoint the forehead (third eye area) and temples of the person partaking in the elixir, either by dabbing a small amount of the mixture or diluting it with a carrier oil for sensitive skin.
b) Ensure the individual performs this anointment just before bedtime, surrounded by a calm and relaxing environment.
c) Encourage the person to meditate before bed on the intention of achieving a lucid dream state, incorporating visualization techniques or repeating the aforementioned incantation.
d) Place a written or drawn representation of the sigil under the person's pillow to reinforce the dream-enhancing energies.

By following these guidelines and carefully crafting the potent elixir, participants will maximize their chances of experiencing vivid and memorable lucid dreams.
