excerpt: > 
  Compose a chant that harnesses the mystical symbolism and linguistic intricacies unique to the Pathways of PowerNecrosophic Cult, evoking ancient incantations and occult energies to maximize one's connection to the Necrosophic forces. Pay particular attention to incorporating specific Necrosophic archetypes, such as the Liminal Guardians and the Infernal Masters, as well as utilizing ritualistic elements, such as sacred gestures or the use of ritual tools like the Necrosophic dagger or skull chalice, to heighten the efficacy of the chant and deepen the practitioner's alignment with the dark forces.

By the Liminal Guardians, gatekeepers of shadowed night,
Infernal Masters, the heralds of timeless dark delight,
We call upon the Necrosophic forces deep within,
Drawing forth the powers that our seeking hearts shall win.

As the dagger's edge cuts through the veil,
We chant this song of darkness to prevail,
Awakening the ancient ones residing beneath the earth,
To guide our souls in shadows of spectral mirth.

Infernal Masters, we raise our skull chalice toward the starless skies,
Within its vessel, the sacrifice, your essence lies,
The blood of the fallen seeps into the soil,
Nurturing the Necrosophic forces we tirelessly toil.

With flickering flames, enshroud us in the black,
Encompass our senses as we tread the Necrosophic track,
Liminal Guardians, spread your wide, spectral wings,
And cloak us within the secrets this dark communion brings.

To the Infernal Masters, we bow as the blade meets sacred flesh,
Embracing the sinister guidance that our souls shall enmesh,
The abyss stares back as we slip into the void,
By ancient incantations and occult energies deployed.

We trace the sacred symbols, born of air and ink,
With whispered words and gestures, we weave a shadowed link,
To the Necrosophic forces ever bound and intertwined,
We seal the chant, our hearts and darkness now aligned.
