## I. Introduction

Goetia refers to the practice of summoning, invoking, or evoking spirits, with particular focus on the 72 spirits listed in the Ars Goetia, a section of the Lesser Key of Solomon. The purpose of this guide is to provide a comprehensive overview of each Goetic spirit, detailing their unique functions, corresponding sigils, and associated rituals. It will also explore potential synergies and interplay between the spirits to achieve enhanced manifestations and outcomes.

Each Goetic spirit has a unique sigil or seal, which serves as a visual representation of their essence and a means of connecting with them.

C. Invocation & Evocation
The summoning of a Goetic spirit can be performed using both invocation and evocation techniques, often accompanied by specific prayers, chants, or incantations.

D. Offerings & Pacts
Making offerings to the spirits or forming pacts can be an effective way to gain their assistance and cooperation.
