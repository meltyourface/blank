## The Timeless Song of Transformation

In the ageless caverns of Cymric land, I stand,
A restless spirit, Taliesin reborn,
Auspiciously I weave, through songs profound,
The tapestry of ancient Druid lore.

Upon the shores of Llyn Tegid, I recall;
Ceridwen stirred her cauldron, evoking change,
Transformative potion, to enlighten or enslave -
I lock my gaze with Awen's shimmering glance.

One dawn, I recite to spirited winds,
The songs of ancient wisdom, resonating still,
Seeking solace as the world spirals in disarray,
An aching chorus to heal the fragmented hearts.

The moonlit owl, the vigilant guide of night,
Espies the secrets coiled beneath,
As Ceridwen, mother of creation, ever stirs -
So, the cauldron's depths reveal our inner strife.

In the breath of the wyvern, fire's deft potency,
Lies a flickering ember of mystical awakening -
The union of past and present, intertwined,
A beacon of hope, to soothe discordant cries.

I harbinger the wisdom of yore,
A master of ancient verse, to navigate through these times,
A vessel of Awen, unbounded, unbroken â€“
Hark, the song of modern myth, soul-inspired.

The spark, the muse, the fertile flame expands,
Dispersing star-like seeds of courage, love, and vibrancy,
Druidic revelations, heralding from ancient days,
Fans the coals of inner mastery, now to rise.

In this dance of transformation, I evoke,
The Druid characters, their verdant tales unfurl -
The song is sung, the cauldron stirred, the potion cast,
Let the sacred wisdom temper modern souls.
