"Rosemary's Baby" (1968), "The Exorcist" (1973), and "Eyes Wide Shut" (1999) are three significant films that have played a substantial part in shaping the portrayal of occultism in the Hollywood scene. Each of these films presents a unique positioning and symbolism of the esoteric, while also highlighting the evolving perspective of society in this domain. In this analysis, we will delve into the symbolism found in these films, the ways they depicted occultism, and how these depictions have transformed alongside popular culture's comprehension of esotericism and the influence of secret societies in the entertainment industry.

Starting with "Rosemary's Baby," directed by Roman Polanski in 1968. The movie revolves around a young woman named Rosemary (Mia Farrow) who, after moving into a new apartment with her husband, becomes pregnant and begins to suspect that her neighbors are part of a satanic cult planning sinister events for her yet-to-be-born child. The film utilizes various symbols connected to the occult and witchcraft, such as the tannis root necklace that Rosemary wears throughout the movie, representing protection but also control from the witches. Furthermore, the movie highlights the infernal ritual performed to impregnate Rosemary, reinforcing the fear and fascination that surrounded Satanism during the 1960s. The apartment building itself, modeled after the real-life Dakota Building in New York City, becomes a symbol for both historical and contemporary occultism, given its rumored connection to various supernatural occurrences.

"The Exorcist," directed by William Friedkin in 1973, follows the story of a young girl named Regan (Linda Blair) who is possessed by a demonic entity and the two priests who attempt to exorcise the demon from her. The movie explores themes such as the battle between good and evil, as demonstrated by the interconnected destinies of Regan, Father Merrin, and Father Karras. One notable symbol found in the film is the statue of Pazuzu, an ancient Assyrian demon, signifying the evil force that possesses Regan. Throughout the movie, the use of upside-down crosses, levitation, and horrific transformations all contribute to the depiction of occult power and demonic possession. The film, along with the novel it was based on, revitalized public interest in exorcism and the supernatural, while also amplifying the fear of influential and hidden forces from the spiritual world.

Lastly, "Eyes Wide Shut," directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1999, stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a couple who become involved with a masked, high-society sexual ritual. The movie delves into the theme of secret societies and presents its audience with various and often cryptic symbols that signify control, manipulation, and sexual power dynamics. Key symbols include the use of Venetian-style masks to maintain anonymity, the ritualistic chanting during the secret gathering, and the exclusive mansion where the elite delves into their hedonistic desires. The exploration of these dark themes by a mainstream director such as Kubrick helped raise more awareness of secret societies' inner workings and their influence within the entertainment industry and wider society.

In conclusion, "Rosemary's Baby," "The Exorcist," and "Eyes Wide Shut" have significantly contributed to the portrayal of occultism in the Hollywood scene, each through their unique representation of symbolism and themes. While "Rosemary's Baby" highlights the fascination and fear of Satanism and witchcraft, "The Exorcist" delves into demonology, exorcism, and the eternal struggle between good and evil forces. Finally, "Eyes Wide Shut" uncovers the influence and control exhibited by secret societies in the entertainment industry and the world at large. Over time, the understanding of esotericism and secret societies in popular culture has evolved, and these films have contributed to shaping the way the audience perceives these themes, further impacting filmmaking and storytelling going forward.
