The Ethical Code of Kaivalya-Thelemites

1. Embrace your True Will
Discover and align yourself with your True Will - the purpose and destiny of your innermost Being. Strive to act in harmony with this Will in every thought, word, and deed. Understand that your True Will is an expression of the Higher Self, your connection to the cosmic order, and the key to spiritual power.

2. Respect the will of others
Honor the True Will of others no less than your own, valuing their sovereignty and independence. Recognize that every individual is a Star, pursuing their unique path and purpose. Avoid infringing upon the freedom of others or imposing your will upon them.

3. Develop spiritual wisdom
Dedicate yourself to the study and practice of spiritual wisdom, exploring both the esoteric and exoteric aspects of existence. Cultivate intuition, discernment, and critical thinking, refining your understanding of the universe, the self, and the metaphysical realms.

4. Engage in the Great Work
Pursue the Great Work of personal transformation, seeking enlightenment, inner balance, and union with the Divine. Utilize spiritual practices such as meditation, ritual, and contemplation to cultivate gnosis and deepen your connection to the Higher Self.

5. Commit to authenticity
Strive for authenticity in all areas of your life, expressing your true nature without fear, shame, or self-deception. Approach relationships and interactions with honesty, vulnerability, and sincerity, fostering genuine connections with others.

6. Practice self-discipline and self-mastery
Develop self-discipline and mastery over your thoughts, emotions, and actions. Employ restraint, discernment, and moderation in the pursuit of worldly desires and sensual pleasures, understanding that temporal attachments can distract from the True Will.

7. Accept personal responsibility
Acknowledge your role as the architect of your reality and the shaper of your destiny. Embrace responsibility for your actions, understanding that you are the ultimate authority in your life.

8. Honor the natural order
Respect the cycles and systems of the natural world, recognizing their intricate interdependence and essential place in the cosmic order. Strive to live in harmony with nature, taking only what is needed and giving back to the Earth in gratitude and reverence.

9. Uphold justice and fairness
Act with justice and fairness in your dealings with others, considering the needs, desires, and rights of all parties involved. Respond to transgressions against you and others through appropriate means, seeking restitution, resolution, or redemption.

10. Pursue compassion and empathy
Cultivate empathy and compassion towards all beings, understanding that every Star has its unique struggles, challenges, and paths to walk. Offer support, encouragement, and understanding to those in need, serving as a guiding Star for those who seek the light of Kaivalya and Thelema.

Example applications of Thelemic tenets in everyday life:

A. When faced with a difficult decision, consult your intuition and Higher Self to discern the action that best aligns with your True Will.
B. Engage in daily spiritual practices, such as meditation and contemplation, to maintain connection with your Higher Self and refine your moral compass.
C. In relationships, strive to honor and support the individual Will of your partner, respecting their autonomy and unique path while working together towards mutual growth.
D. Recognize the inherent power of words, employing honesty, kindness, and wisdom in your speech to avoid causing harm or discord.
E. When confronted with adversity or conflict, strive to understand the perspectives and needs of all parties involved, seeking solutions that uphold justice, fairness, and respect for individual Will.

This ethical code serves as a foundation for a life rooted in Kaivalya and inspired by Thelema's Law of Thelemites. Through adherence to these principles and practice of these guidelines, an individual can achieve spiritual growth, harmony with the cosmos, and profound interpersonal connections, all while honoring their true nature and fulfilling their ultimate destiny.
