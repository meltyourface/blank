## Incendium Spiritus Amicabilis - The Incense of Amicable Spirits

Ingredients:
1. Sandalwood (Santalum album) - 2 parts
2. Frankincense (Boswellia sacra) - 2 parts
3. Myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) - 1 part
4. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) - 1 part
5. Copal (Protium copal) - 1 part
6. Dragonsblood resin (Daemonorops draco) - 1 part
7. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - Â½ part
8. Ambergris (Ambra grisea) - a small pinch

Instructions for Preparation:
1. In a mortar, grind the sandalwood, frankincense, myrrh, lavender, and copal into a fine powder.
2. Add the ground herbs to a mixing bowl.
3. Incorporate the dragonsblood resin, crushing it with the pestle in the mortar until it reaches a powdered state.
4. Sprinkle the powdered dragonsblood resin and mugwort into the mixing bowl, stirring the mixture in a clockwise motion.
5. Finally, add a small pinch of ambergris, symbolizing the bridge between the physical and spiritual realms.
6. Store the mixture in a tightly sealed jar, preferably a dark-colored glass container, and leave it to meld and mature for at least one moon cycle (28 days) in a dark, cool location. This will strengthen the potency and harmonious energy of the blend.

Instructions for the Elaborate Spiritual Summoning Ceremony:
1. Choose a suitable location for the ritual, preferably secluded and peaceful.
2. Thoroughly cleanse the area by burning sage or other purifying herbs, creating a sacred space.
3. Inscribe the chosen symbols of protection and invitation for the desired spirits on a circular piece of cloth or parchment, placing it at the center of the ritual area.
4. Arrange the ritual implements and offerings, such as chalices of pure water, fresh flowers, and any other symbolically significant objects representing the principle elements (air, fire, water, and earth), on an outer ring around the inscribed symbols.
5. Light charcoal in a heat-safe incense burner and carefully place it on the central inscribed symbols.
6. As the charcoal begins to smolder, scatter a generous amount of the prepared Incendium Spiritus Amicabilis blend over it.
7. While the incense smoke rises, recite your chosen incantation, invoking the presence and goodwill of the amicable spirits. Raise your energy and intention with each repetition, forming a strong psychic connection between you and the spiritual realm.
8. Be receptive and open to any messages or visions brought forth by the invoked spirits, allowing the communion and interchange of wisdom and insight to guide you.
9. Upon completion of the communion, express your gratitude to the spirits and thank them for their presence, releasing them from the ritual with a spoken gesture of farewell.
10. Extinguish any remaining flames or smoldering embers and remove all elements of the ritual, leaving the area precisely as it was before the ceremony commenced.
