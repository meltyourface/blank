In the haunted shadows of the undying void, beyond the churning waters of the eternal abyss, there lies the unthinkable realm of the Great Old Ones. Malicious and ancient, these loathsome beings hold the very fabric of time and space in their tentacled grasp, awaiting their moment of rebirth.

"N'gha ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn. Nafl'gnaiih, hupadgh, shogg. K'yarnak shogg nafl'yog k'yarnak zhro'."

In this cursed realm of endless darkness, the slumbering Cthulhu awaits his awakening. Bound within the sunken city of R'lyeh, he lies in a deathlike state, imprisoned, yet ever watchful. Those who utter his name know not the dread they invoke.

"In his deathly slumber, the mighty Cthulhu lies dreaming in the sunken city of R'lyeh, awaiting the time when the stars are right to rise again. Beyond all comprehension, his unspeakable followers chant their loathsome verses, ready to unleash a torrent of dark horrors. They whisper, 'In his eternal sleep, Cthulhu dreams, and upon his awakening, the world shall tremble.'"

The vile language of the necromancy contains the darkest secrets of these ancient beings. Lost knowledge, spoken in the forbidden tongues, causing despair and agony to those foolish enough to seek it. Their omnipotent gaze drills fear into the very soul, as time itself crumbles before them.

The excerpt speaks of the dreaded Cthulhu, submerged in the sunken city of R'lyeh. Through the eons, he dreams of an eternity filled with darkness, awaiting the right time to awaken and unleash an unspeakable terror upon humankind. His sinister followers chant horrifying verses, preparing for the return of their obscene deity, when the stars align to make way for a world-devouring darkness.
