excerpt: > 
  Analyze the role of the supernatural and otherworldly in the development of the protagonists' inner transformation and their journey toward self-discovery within the realms of Romance literature. Compare and contrast the use of enchantments, dream worlds, and arcane symbolism in two or more works from different periods or cultural contexts to illustrate this evolution.

In the vast expanse of Romance literature, the supernatural and otherworldly often act as powerful catalysts for character transformation and self-discovery. By incorporating enchantments, dream worlds, and arcane symbolism, authors foster the development of their protagonists by forcing them to confront their innermost fears and desires. In this analysis, we shall closely examine the use of these elements in the context of two seminal works of Romance literature: Gustave Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" (1856), a French novel set in 19th-century Normandy, and Bram Stoker's "Dracula" (1897), a British work of Gothic fiction.

The supernatural serves as a powerful force in Madame Bovary, manifesting as enchantments that are weaved into the very fabric of its protagonist, Emma Bovary's life. Though not supernatural in the traditional sense, enchantments here refer to the all-consuming romantic ideals that gradually distort Emma's expectations and reality. These enchantments are apparent in her longing for the passion and excitement found in Romantic literature â€“ a desire that remains unquenched by her mundane life as a middle-class wife.

For example, her infatuation with the troubadour Rodolphe shapes her perception of love, as she falls under the spell of his ostensibly grand romantic gestures. The passions that run amok in her mind, fueled by her romantic daydreams, spin a web of impossibilities where her expectations of the real world no longer align with reality. In this context, the enchantments serve to push Emma's character to the edge, culminating in her tragic demise. Thus, the enchantments reveal Emma's inner transformation from a naive girl to a disillusioned woman grappling with the inevitable disillusionment that accompanies the harsh realization of life's mundanity.

In Dracula, the supernatural forms the core of the narrative, as the titular character, Count Dracula, is a vampire with immense power and commanding presence. His supernatural abilities, such as shapeshifting and mind control, wreak havoc in the lives of the protagonists, forcing them to confront their deepest fears and inner turmoil. The journey of Jonathan Harker, Lucy Westenra, and Mina Harker is driven by their encounters with Dracula.

For instance, Lucy Westenra's transformation into a vampire serves as a turning point for the protagonists, where they must confront the darker aspects of their reality and the unknown. Moreover, Mina's struggle to maintain her humanity after being bitten by Dracula provides insight into the duality of human nature and its fight against the forces of darkness. As the supernatural elements compound, the characters are compelled to confront their limits, evolve, and ultimately save humanity from the monstrous threat.

In comparing these two works, we observe that Madame Bovary utilizes enchantments in a more metaphorical sense by illustrating Emma's detachment from reality through her romantic idealism. In contrast, Dracula relies on the literal presence of supernatural elements to drive the characters towards self-discovery and transformation. These distinctions showcase the varying ways authors use the supernatural and otherworldly to mirror their cultural and societal concerns, emphasizing distinctly different aspects of the human experience.

In conclusion, the supernatural and otherworldly elements in Romance literature play a crucial role in shaping the protagonists' inner transformation and journey toward self-discovery. These elements serve both literally and metaphorically in the development of characters, as showcased through the comparison of Madame Bovary and Dracula, where enchantments and supernatural creatures embody the driving forces of change. The unique manner in which they challenge and push the protagonists to confront their inner demons reflects the diversity and potential of Romance literature for illuminating the human experience across different periods and cultural contexts.
