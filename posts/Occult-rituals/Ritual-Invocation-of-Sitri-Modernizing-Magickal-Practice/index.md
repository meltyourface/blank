1. **Entity**: Sitri, from the Goetia, The Lesser Key of Solomon
Sitri is the 12th spirit listed in the Goetia, a powerful prince who commands 60 legions of spirits. He often appears with the head of a leopard and the wings of a griffin but can change into a humanoid form at the practitioner's request. Sitri's primary abilities include inciting love and passion, igniting lust in others, and revealing the secrets of others. This entity is often sought to enhance one's romantic life, provide the power to influence desires, or uncover hidden truths about others' motivations.

2. Updated Tools and Symbols
Traditionally, the tools used for evoking Sitri include a brass or metal ring engraved with Sitri's sigil, a wand or rod made of hazel, and a parchment or paper tablet containing the sigil. **The circle and triangle diagram used in evocation rituals can be updated with contemporary alternatives**:

- Sigil: Update the design in a modern geometric style or create a digital version.
- Ring: Use a steel or silver ring or engraved pendant, which can be worn as a necklace.
- Wand: Replace the wand with a laser pointer or small flashlight for directing energy.
- Circle and Triangle: Utilize contemporary materials like modern chalk or an infrared light pen in drawing the diagram on the floor.
- Incense: Substitute traditional incense with essential oils or an electronic diffuser using scents like rose, sandalwood, or patchouli to attract love and desire.

3. Constructing the Ritual Space
Follow these steps to create a personalized ritual space:

- Choose a space that feels comfortable and private.
- Clear the area of any clutter and distractions.
- Cast a protective circle with the chosen modern medium (e.g., chalk, infrared light pen), large enough to work within comfortably.
- Draw a triangle within the circle's eastern quadrant, with the base touching the circle's edge and a six-inch gap between triangle and circle for safety.
- Place the altar at the western edge of the circle, containing a candle (red or pink) to represent the element of fire, a chalice of water, a feather for air, and a crystal or stone for earth.
- Position a compass at the center of the altar to establish the four cardinal directions for invoking elemental powers and astrological influences.

4. Invocation of Sitri
Begin by lighting the candle and incense or diffuser, and then repeat the following invocation:

"Prince Sitri, powerful spirit of desire, passion, and secrets,
By Earth's foundation and Fire's heat,
By Water's flow and Air's whisper,
I call thee forth.

In this modern age, I recognize your ancient power,
An unbroken line of influence and knowledge,
Through digital connections and worldwide reach,
I summon thee, Sitri, to come and share your wisdom.

Awaken lust, reveal secrets, grant me the passion I seek,
Through the symbols of our new age,
In strength, vulnerability, balance, and grace,
I request your presence for the goals I pursue."

5. Advanced Techniques
When Sitri arrives, deepen the connection using these techniques:

- Meditation: Focus on the rhythmic breathing, allowing the mind and body to resonate with Sitri's energy.
- Visualization: Picture Sitri's form and presence in the room, vividly imagining the colors, textures, and sensations.
- Energy Manipulation: Sensitize your hands to the energy pulses emanating from Sitri and direct this energy towards your specific intent.

6. Closing the Ritual
Ensure a safe conclusion by following these steps:

- Respectfully thank Sitri for their assistance, asking them to depart and granting them permission to leave.
- Perform a banishment by reciting a universal banishing statement, such as, "By the powers that granted your presence, I now release you. Depart in peace."
- Snuff out the candle and cleanse the space by diffusing a grounding scent (e.g., sage, lavender) or using a sound cleansing technique (e.g., bells, singing bowls).
- Ground residual energies by sitting or lying down, visualizing any remaining energy flowing into the earth, and focusing on reconnecting with the physical realm.
- Dismantle the ritual space by wiping away the circle and triangle, clearing the incense, and taking down the altar items.
- Reflect on your experience and document any insights or messages received during the ritual in a journal or digital note.
