## Psychic TV and Thee Majesty: A Journey Through Art, Music, and the Occult

Introduction

Psychic TV and Thee Majesty are transformative experimental art and music projects that have made a profound impact on the occult and esoteric communities. In this section, we will dive deep into the history, philosophy, and key concepts of these influential entities, exploring their founding members, central beliefs, and notable works. By the end of this section, students and initiates should have gained a deeper understanding of the complex tapestry woven by these avant-garde pioneers.

### I. History

Psychic TV was established as an experimental music and artistic collective in 1981 by musician Genesis P-Orridge and video artist Peter Christopherson. Former members of the controversial industrial music group Throbbing Gristle, they sought to explore new directions in audio and visual expression, harnessing the power of both areas to act as a conduit for their esoteric and unconventional ideas.

Thee Majesty, on the other hand, is a spoken-word project formed in the late 1990s by Genesis P-Orridge, focusing on his poetry, lyrical storytelling, and spiritual incantation. The project explores the idea of personal transformation and thought-provoking dialogue, further demonstrating P-Orridge's lifelong commitment to examining the boundaries of self and society.

### II. Philosophy

At the heart of both Psychic TV and Thee Majesty lies the guiding philosophy of P-Orridge's own spiritual system, known as Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY). This anarchic magical and philosophical movement encourages individuals to break free from societal constraints and dogma and instead focus on personal growth, transformation, and self-realization.

TOPY's central tenet is the importance of non-conformity and self-expression. Informed by diverse influences such as Aleister Crowley's Thelema, Austin Osman Spare's sigil magic, and Brion Gysin's cut-up technique, the movement seeks to empower individuals to transcend limiting beliefs and societal conditioning through artistic creation, community, ritual, and occult practice.

### III. Key Concepts

1. Magick and Ritual: Psychic TV and Thee Majesty often incorporate elements of magick and ritual in their performances, drawing on P-Orridge's understanding of ceremonial practice, sigil work, and trance states to create a potent and transformative atmosphere for listeners.

2. The Cut-up Technique: Borrowed from author and artist Brion Gysin, Psychic TV has extensively used the cut-up method of rearranging and splicing together various forms of media – written word, audio, and visual – to create new and unexpected combinations, thereby challenging perceptions of reality and meaning.

3. Subversion and Taboo: Both projects engage in themes of subversion and taboo, often addressing subjects considered controversial or provocative to provoke deep thought and introspection, thereby encouraging listeners to question societal norms and prescribed belief systems.

### IV. Notable Works

Psychic TV has produced a vast body of work over a career spanning several decades, including groundbreaking albums such as "Force Thee Hand Ov Chance" (1982), "Dreams Less Sweet" (1983), and "Allegory And Self" (1988). These recordings showcase the group's ability to transcend traditional genre boundaries while incorporating esoteric themes and experimentation.

Thee Majesty's notable works often focus on collaborations with other artists, incorporating spoken word, poetry, and music. Examples include "Psychick TV & Genesis P-Orridge With White Stains - Thee Fractured Garden" (1994) and "A Hollow Cost" (1994), which features Genesis P-Orridge's haunting spoken-word performance set to ethereal, atmospheric soundscapes.

Conclusion

Psychic TV and Thee Majesty represent the culmination of years of exploration, experimentation, and restless innovation in the realms of art, music, and the occult. By engaging with their works, students and initiates can unearth deeper understandings of the connections between the esoteric and creative expression and discover new paths to personal transformation.
