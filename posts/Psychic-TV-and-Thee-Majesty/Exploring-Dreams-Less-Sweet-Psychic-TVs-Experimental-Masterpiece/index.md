Album Chosen: Psychic TV - "Dreams Less Sweet" (1983)

"Dreams Less Sweet" stands as an exemplary work displaying the boundless creativity of Psychic TV and their pioneering spirit in experimental music. Released in 1983 as their second studio album, it showcases the band's ability to transition fluidly between various genres while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of avant-garde and esoteric music.

Musical Structure:
The album features a diverse array of musical styles, incorporating elements of industrial, noise, ambient, and even traditional pop structures. Each track contains a unique musical arrangement, with Psychic TV using unconventional instrumentation and tape manipulation techniques to create otherworldly sonic landscapes. The liberal use of sampling – from ambient sounds, field recordings, and dialogue snippets – serves to further blur the lines between music and noise, resulting in a challenging yet captivating listening experience.

Lyrical Content:
"Dreams Less Sweet" delves into themes of mysticism, religion, and occultism, which are consistent with the band's association with Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY). The lyrics often leave ample room for interpretation, inviting listeners to embark on their own journey of exploration and introspection. Many tracks, such as the discordant "The Orchids," serve as vehicles for poetical reflections on themes ranging from existentialism to the human condition.

Historical Context & Artistic Choices:
"Dreams Less Sweet" was released in a period marked by rapid technological advancements in music production and recording. Capitalizing on these advancements, Psychic TV experimented with the then-cutting-edge Holophonic audio process, which aimed to create three-dimensional aural experiences. The adoption of this innovative technology showcases their fearless pursuit of new artistic possibilities and cements the album's place in the pantheon of influential experimental works.

Interplay between Psychic TV, Thee Majesty, and the Surrounding Subculture:
Though Thee Majesty was not formed until the late 90s, their artistic roots can be traced back to Psychic TV's early output. Genesis P-Orridge, the driving force behind both projects, embraced esoteric philosophers such as Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare, and displayed a willingness to incorporate non-musical elements, such as art installations and performance art, into their oeuvre. This interdisciplinary approach helped foster a subculture centered around TOPY and its affiliates, in which members shared philosophical ideas, creativity, and a penchant for pushing boundaries.

Impact on the Broader Musical Landscape:
"Dreams Less Sweet" has undoubtedly left a lasting impact on the experimental and esoteric genres, laying the groundwork for projects like Coil, Current 93, and even Nurse with Wound. Moreover, it has driven countless musicians to explore unconventional instrumentation, recording techniques, and sonic textures. The distinctive sounds and themes found throughout the album continue to reverberate in the works of more recent experimental acts like Death in June and Prurient.

In conclusion, Psychic TV's "Dreams Less Sweet" remains a landmark album that encompassed elements of experimental, industrial, and ambient music. Empowered by the creative prowess of Genesis P-Orridge, the album presented a plethora of esoteric themes, atmospheric soundscapes, and challenging compositions. This seminal work has left an indelible influence on the genre of esoteric music and the wider subculture that stems from it.
