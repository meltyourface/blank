Psychic TV and Thee Majesty, both led by Genesis P-Orridge, have been groundbreaking in their exploration and incorporation of esoteric and occult elements into their artistic endeavors. Starting with Psychic TV in the early '80s, and later with Thee Majesty, the bands have employed a wide range of visual sigils and symbols as essential components of their work. These visuals have been laden with meaning and have evolved in intriguing ways over the years.

Chronological Development of Visual Sigils and Symbols:

1. Early Psychic TV (1981-1988): In their early years, Psychic TV's visual sigils drew heavily on influences such as Aleister Crowley's Thelema, Austin Osman Spareâ€™s Zos Kia, and the chaos magic movement. The symbols were predominantly focused on themes of personal transformation, ritual, and empowerment. Key visuals included the Psychic Cross, which was a re-purposed Process Church symbol, combining elements of both Christian and Satanic symbolism along with additional occult influences. 

2. Late Psychic TV (1988-1999) and Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY): As P-Orridge and his cohorts delved deeper into the esoteric, their symbols evolved to incorporate a wider variety of sources, including hermeticism, kabbalah, and Eastern mysticism. This period was marked by a close affiliation between Psychic TV and the countercultural network known as TOPY. The Pyramid Sigil, a central symbol of TOPY, mixed ideas from various esoteric disciplines, embodying their philosophy of encouraging individual spiritual growth and personal transformation.

3. Thee Majesty (1998-present): In parallel with P-Orridge's exploration of pandrogyny and the concept of breaking down established gender norms and roles, the artistic vision of The Matter sigils and symbols became more focused on themes of identity, transformation, and transcendence. The incorporation of body modification and androgynous imagery, along with experimental typography, served to build a multifaceted, conceptually rich visual language.

Connections and Parallels:

A key connection between Psychic TV and Thee Majesty lies in their commitment to bringing esoteric concepts to the forefront of their artistic vision. Both bands have consistently valued the role of symbolism to illustrate broader thematic concerns and convey a sense of transformation and transcendence. Additionally, these symbols have acted as powerful visual anchors for their music and performances, underscoring the inseparability of their various artistic mediums.

Speculation on Potential Future Developments:

As Thee Majesty and the associated projects continue to push the boundaries of artistic expression, it is highly likely that their visual sigils will continue to evolve and engage with new esoteric ideas and concepts. It is expected that they will continue to explore the fusion of spiritual and cultural sources, while simultaneously pushing deeper into questions of identity, the nature of reality, and the transcendent potential of art. Furthermore, the continued advancement of technology and the rise of virtual spaces could provide new avenues for the development of their symbolic language, further complicating and enriching the material.
