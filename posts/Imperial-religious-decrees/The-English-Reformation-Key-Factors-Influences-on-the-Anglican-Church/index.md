The English Reformation was a crucial event that led to profound changes in the religious landscape of Britain, shaping not only the establishment of the Anglican Church but also influencing the beliefs and practices of countless individuals. Central to the Reformation were the roles of imperial religious decrees, key theological figures, and shifts in esoteric and occult practices that ultimately facilitated the formation of the new religious movement.

Imperial religious decrees played an essential part in the English Reformation. The break with the Roman Catholic Church was made official through a series of decrees put forth by the English Monarchy, beginning with the Act of Supremacy (1534) that declared King Henry VIII the head of the Church of England. Subsequently, the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536-1541) led to the consolidation of Henry’s power and wealth through the seizure of Catholic properties. These decrees were vital in solidifying the Anglican Church’s authority and autonomy.

The English Reformation saw the rise of several key theological figures. Thomas Cranmer, the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the newly formed Anglican Church, was essential in shaping its religious doctrine. He was the principal author of the Book of Common Prayer (1549) and the Anglican 42 Articles (1553), which highlighted core beliefs of the new faith. The influence of the Protestant Reformation, especially the works of Martin Luther and John Calvin, also played a crucial role in the English Reformation. Their ideas on justification by faith, the primacy of scripture, and the priesthood of all believers deeply impacted the theological framework of the Anglican Church.

The shift in prevailing esoteric and occult practices during that era was also a crucial factor in the development of the Anglican Church. As the Catholic Church was strongly associated with mysticism and ritual, the English Reformation sought to distance itself from that aspect. Thus, the new Anglican Church favored a more straightforward, Bible-oriented approach, which suppressed many esoteric and occult practices of the time.

Sociopolitical factors were also intertwined with the establishment and development of the Anglican Church. The desire to secure an heir, Henry VIII's wish to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the tense relationship between England and Rome, and the English government’s aspiration to establish a national identity separate from the Roman Catholic Church all played pivotal roles in the rise of Anglicanism.

A comparative analysis of the various Reformation movements across Europe shows both similarities and differences in the shaping of the Anglican Church doctrine and liturgy. While the Church of England shared common ground with the Calvinist and Lutheran churches regarding the rejection of the Pope's authority, the Anglican Church maintained elements of the Catholic liturgical tradition, such as a hierarchical structure and the retention of certain rituals, which differentiated it from other Protestant churches.

In conclusion, the multifaceted influences of the English Reformation on the establishment of the Anglican Church are apparent, with imperial religious decrees, key theological figures, and the shift in esoteric and occult practices playing vital roles. Sociopolitical factors contributed significantly to the formation of the new religious movement, while the comparative analysis of various Reformation movements across Europe demonstrates the simultaneous similarities and differences in the beliefs and practices of the Anglican Church.
