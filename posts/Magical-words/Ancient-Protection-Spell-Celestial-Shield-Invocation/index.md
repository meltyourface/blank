excerpt: >
  1. Address and incorporate the four primary elements of earth, air, fire, and water, each representing a cardinal direction and strength to bolster the protection.
  
  2. Specify three sacred symbols or sigils that strengthen the mystical shield and provide additional, more targeted defenses against specific threats such as curses or psychic attacks.
  
  3. Encapsulate within its prose at least one core concept of light and benevolence, in opposition to the negativity of the encroaching energies, which reinforces the barrier's potency.

Incantation:

From the realms of ancient power, I summon thee,
Eurus, Boreas, Notos, Zephyrus, wisdom of the ages setting free,
Earth's unwavering foundation, air's ethereal breath,
Fire's burning passion, water's ever-changing depth,
Stand united, the guardians of cardinal directions manifest.

Guard the seal, Protect us from unwanted forces.

Glyph of the Unbroken Circle, encircle and secure, halt the curses' course,
Sigil of the Ascended Eye, watchful and wise, deflect the psychic plight,
Seal of the Illuminated Heart, resonate with love, harness the light to fight.

With strength combine, the sacred symbols now align.
Shielding us from darkness, against the night, let nothing pass and fight.

Guard the seal, Protect us from unwanted forces.

Within this prose, let the light of benevolence unfold,
The radiance of a thousand suns, dispelling shadow's cold,
With the power of creation, darkness finds no place to hide,
Against this unyielding brilliance, the wicked are denied.

Guard the seal, Protect us from unwanted forces.

As above, so below, the universal harmony unfolds,
Melodies of our song bind within, ancient secrets retold,
Rhythmic patterns intertwine with waters deep and fires bright,
Air and earth, united as one, to fortify the shield's protective might.

Guard the seal, Protect us from unwanted forces.

Upon this celestial day, gather to commence the ritual grade,
At the crossroads, where worlds intertwine, begin in the deepest shade,
Bear a lantern of divine essence, the essence of life's rebirth,
Follow the celestial signs, along the spiral path of the earth.

Light the fires of the sacred rite, let elements unite,
Offerings of herbs and stones, to enhance the ethereal sight,
From the chalice of celestial wine, imbibe the essence of pure light,
Raise thy hands to the luminous sky, connecting realms to set it right.

Finish the circle, complete the charm,
Barrier secured, eternal and strong.
