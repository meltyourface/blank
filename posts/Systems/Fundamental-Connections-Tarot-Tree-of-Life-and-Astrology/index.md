Introduction:
In order to understand the fundamental correlations between the designs of the three diverse occult systems - Tarot, Tree of Life, and Astrology - we must first delve into the basics of each system individually. The Tarot is a deck of cards used for divination and personal growth, the Tree of Life is a Kabbalistic diagram representing the emanations of God and the universe, and Astrology is the belief in the celestial bodies' influence over human affairs and the natural world.

Tarot:
The Tarot is a collection of 78 cards divided into two main sections: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards representing the spiritual journey and archetypes, while the Minor Arcana consists of 56 cards divided into four suits (Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles) that signify various aspects of life, emotions, intellect, and material matters. Tarot is often used for divination, introspection, and meditation, allowing the reader to tap into their intuition and gain access to their subconscious mind.

Tree of Life:
The Tree of Life is a diagram from the Jewish mystical system known as Kabbalah, which represents the ten divine emanations or Sefirot through which God interacts with the universe. Each Sefirah on the Tree of Life corresponds to a specific aspect of God, from the limitless divine light (Keter) to the foundation of the physical world (Malkuth). It is believed that by meditating upon and contemplating the Tree of Life, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the divine, ultimately leading to spiritual enlightenment.

Astrology:
Astrology is an ancient belief system that seeks to understand the influence of celestial bodies (planets, stars, and constellations) upon human affairs and the natural world. The most widely known branch of astrology, Western astrology, utilizes the twelve zodiac signs that are associated with specific traits, tendencies, and characteristics. These signs are influenced by the planets' positions within a natal chart, which is believed to shape an individual's destiny, personality, and spiritual growth.

Interconnectivity: 
Now that we've grasped the fundamentals of each system, we can explore their interconnections, which foster self-realization and spiritual growth.

1. Symbolism: Symbols are powerful tools that help us perceive the world around us and understand the connections within it. All three systems utilize symbolism to evoke deep layers of understanding and transform the practitioner's consciousness. The Tarot deck, for instance, communicates through richly detailed imagery, while the Tree of Life and Astrology use intricate diagrams.

2. Archetypes: The Tarot and Astrology both contain archetypal representations of human experiences and personalities. The Major Arcana cards embody universal archetypes such as the Magician, the Empress, and the Fool. Astrology's zodiac signs signify archetypal traits like the courageous Aries, the intuitive Cancer, or the balanced Libra. Studying these archetypes can lead to a profound understanding of human nature and individual self-awareness.

3. Spiritual growth: By exploring the connections between the systems, practitioners can foster the integration of multiple perspectives into their spiritual growth. For example, one could study the correspondences between the Tarot's Major Arcana and the Sefirot on the Tree of Life, discovering how spiritual energies flow between the two systems. Additionally, examining the planets' influence within one's astrological chart can provide insights into personal strengths and weaknesses, leading to self-improvement and spiritual development.

Conclusion:
In summary, the key themes that connect the Tarot, the Tree of Life, and Astrology are the use of symbolism, the presence of archetypes, and the overarching goal of spiritual growth. By understanding the correlations among these systems, individuals can tap into the rich tapestry of esoteric knowledge to foster personal self-realization and spiritual evolution.
