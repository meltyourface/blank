D. Symbolism
1. **Skulls and skeletons**: Universal symbols of death used across cultures and time, representing the transient nature of life.
2. **Crossroads**: Associated with death in Greek, Roman, and African folklore, crossroads symbolize the intersection between the worlds of the living and the dead.
