Necromancy is the practice of communicating with the deceased, typically with the purpose of divination or to gain knowledge and insight. It originated in ancient times and has evolved and developed through the centuries, influenced by cultural, social, and religious factors. Medieval grimoires, such as the "Lemegeton" and the "Munich Handbook of Necromancy," provide us with a wealth of information on the intricacies of these rituals and practices.

Methodologies and tools employed in necromantic rituals include the use of circles and symbols for protection and the summoning of spirits, as well as the employment of various items like candles, sacred herbs, and animal parts. Incantations, often written in archaic languages (like Latin or Greek), would be recited by the necromancer to establish communication with the deceased and maintain control over the spiritual proceedings.

The origins of necromancy can be traced back to ancient civilizations like Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. In these cultures, death held a prominent role in religious beliefs, and the afterlife was viewed as an extension of the mortal realm. This perspective established the foundation for necromantic practices as people sought answers and guidance from the dead. As the practice spread across different regions, it adapted to local customs, mythologies, and religious beliefs, often incorporating elements of magic, alchemy, and astrology. This led to the formation of different schools of thought within the occult world, such as theurgy and goetia, each with its own unique approach to necromancy.

Social, religious, and cultural influences played significant roles in shaping the necromancer's practice. In medieval Europe, necromancy became associated with black magic and heresy, as it was perceived to be a defiance of God's will and an act of consorting with demons. This led to the persecution of many practitioners, forcing them to conduct their rituals in secret. Symbols and imagery from Christianity and other religions were often incorporated into necromantic ceremonies, serving as protective talismans, metaphors for spiritual concepts, or representations of the forces involved in the process of communicating with the dead.

A comparative study of necromantic practices from different regions and schools of thought reveals interesting similarities and divergences. For instance, the ancient Egyptians employed the "Opening of the Mouth" ceremony to connect with the deceased, whereas Tibetan Buddhists practice "Ch√∂d" rituals to confront and transform the energies of death and suffering. Moreover, variations in the specific methods, tools, and incantations used can be found depending on regional and cultural contexts, as well as the individual necromancer's spiritual inclinations and knowledge.

In conclusion, necromantic practices embody a rich tapestry of knowledge, symbolism, and cultural influences, with their roots in ancient beliefs about death and the afterlife. These practices have developed and diverged over time, shaped by social, religious, and cultural contexts, as well as the distinct schools of thought within the occult world. The study of medieval grimoires, rituals, and methodologies provides valuable insights into this fascinating aspect of the human experience with death and the search for truth in the unknown realms.
