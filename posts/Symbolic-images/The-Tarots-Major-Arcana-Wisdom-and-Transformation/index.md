excerpt: > 
  Craft an intricate piece of poetry that vividly captures the essence of the mystical and symbolic imagery found within the twenty-two Major Arcana cards of the Tarot deck. Select three distinct cards as your primary sources of inspiration, exploring the depths of their visual symbolism and weaving in nuanced interpretations of the archetypes they represent. Intertwine these elements artfully within the poetic narrative, employing a sophisticated array of literary devices and an intricate rhyme scheme to elevate the prose and challenge the reader to unravel the layered meanings hidden within.

In ethereal realms of mystic thought, I tread,
Where cryptic symbols whisper ancient lore,
From realms unseen, upon a gossamer thread,
The Tarot's tales unfold, both wise and pure.

Upon this plane, three shadows intertwine,
The Hermit, Temperance, and Death, they gleam,
Embodied forces vast, incisive and divine,
A tapestry of archetypes, they weave and sing.

I: The Hermit - Solemn keeper of the flame,
Ascends the peak with lantern gleaming bright,
An inner light reveals the hidden plane,
A solace sought in his eternal night.

As keeper of the wisdom, old and deep,
He walks alone, a spectral life he wields,
And in his anthroponic gaze, he reaps,
The bounty of the world concealed.

II: Temperance; Alchemist of celestial sways,
With wings outstretched, she treads the water's edge,
Resplendent in her glory and her grace,
Uniting opposites, she finds her place.

Her measured pour of truth, a stream unwinds,
Zeal tempered by her touch, and passion cooled,
A fusion of the soul and earthly binds,
The art of harmony, she breathes and rules.

III: Capricious Death, the indomitable force,
Defying mortal odds, on spectral steed,
A harvester of souls and of remorse,
Against his fearsome power, no heart can plead.

A transformation looms in haunting eyes,
As life surrenders to the impending change,
Beneath the veil of fear, a blessing lies,
Reshaped, reborn, through Death's eternal flame.

In stanzas cryptic, woven in their might,
The Major Arcana's wisdom be explored,
Pause Hermit, Temperance, and Death's delight,
A dance of shadows and of heaven's chords.

What whispered truths these ancient symbols hold?
Prepare thy spirit in this quest untold.
