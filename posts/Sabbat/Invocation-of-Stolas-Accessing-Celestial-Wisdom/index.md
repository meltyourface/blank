Translation of the Invocation Ritual of Stolas from the Ars Goetia:

Original Text:

"O Mighty Stolas, Great Prince and Lord of the Zodiac, who commands the knowledge of the stars and the wisdom of herbs and stones, I humbly beseech thee to grace me with your glorious presence. By the authority of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I entreat thee to bestow upon me thy knowledge and guidance. I invoke the sacred names of Tetragrammaton, Adonai, Eheieh, and Agla so that you may be compelled to reveal the secrets of your vast knowledge."

Modern English Translation:

"O Powerful Stolas, distinguished Prince and Ruler of the Zodiac, who possesses expertise in the stars and the understanding of plants and stones, I earnestly request for you to honor me with your magnificent presence. By the power held in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I ask for you to share your wisdom and guidance with me. I call upon the holy names of Tetragrammaton, Adonai, Eheieh, and Agla to compel you to disclose the mysteries of your extensive wisdom."

Analysis of the Translated Text:

The invocation ritual of Stolas, a demon studied within the Ars Goetia, presents significant symbolism and complexity that has its roots in both the Lesser Key of Solomon and other occult practices.

First and foremost, Stolas is a demon described as a Great Prince within the hierarchy of the Goetic demons, signifying the respect and authority associated with him. Additionally, his association with the Zodiac highlights his significance in the realm of astrology, reinforcing the idea that those who invoke him are seeking guidance regarding the heavens and celestial events.

The request for Stolas to share his knowledge of the stars, plants, and stones showcases the longing for occult wisdom in various realms, such as astrology, herbalism, and mineral properties. These connections to natural elements also demonstrate the ritual's links to the witchcraft practices of the time, where such knowledge would undoubtedly be highly prized.

The invocation of the names of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in addition to calling upon Tetragrammaton, Adonai, Eheieh, and Agla, shows the importance of spiritual power in controlling and compelling the demon. These names act as commanding forces that illustrate the ritualist's authority while seeking Stolas' cooperation.

In connection to the Sabbat, Stolas' wisdom and expertise in occult knowledge make him a potentially desired source of information for practitioners. While the ritual itself might not have direct ties to the Sabbat, those participating in such gatherings could incorporate aspects of the invocation to enhance their understanding of the stars, plants, and stones.

Overall, the invocation ritual of Stolas bears a strong representation of occult symbolism, highlighting the values and desires of the practitioners who engage with the demon. Furthermore, its connections to other contemporary occult practices emphasize the broader context in which the Ars Goetia operates, as its rituals continue to hold significance and influence over time.
