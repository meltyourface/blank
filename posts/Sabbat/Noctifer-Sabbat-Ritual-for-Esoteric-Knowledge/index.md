## The Rite of the Nocturnal Assembly

Purpose: The purpose of this ritual is to evoke and commune with the chosen entity, one of the dark pantheon known as Noctifer, the Bringer of Night and Shadows. Through this intricate Sabbat ritual, the practitioner seeks to gain esoteric knowledge, guidance, and establish a powerful connection with Noctifer.

Ceremonial Preparations:

1. The ritual must be performed during a moonless night, preferably during the New Moon phase, to ensure the energies of darkness are at their strongest.
2. Choose a secluded and undisturbed location, preferably outdoors or in a room with no windows and a bare floor, to serve as your ceremonial space.
3. Purify and consecrate the ritual space by anointing the four corners with blood, representing the connection and offering to the dark forces.
4. Set up an altar in the center of the ritual space, covering it with a black cloth and placing items representing the four elements (earth, air, fire, water).

Ritual Tools:

1. A ritual blade or dagger to inscribe symbols and direct energy.
2. A chalice filled with an offering (specifically red wine or sacrificial blood).
3. Incense (preferably of myrrh, frankincense or copal) to cleanse and empower the space.
4. A black candle, symbolizing Noctifer's domain and the void he emerges from.
5. A bowl of water, representing the element of water and the subconscious realm.
6. A leather or parchment scroll, quill, and ink for transcribing any guidance or knowledge received during the ritual.

The Invocation:

1. Begin by lighting the incense and black candle. Stand before your altar, positioning yourself in a meditative stance, with deep rhythmic breaths, focusing your mind solely on Noctifer and your intentions.
2. With your ritual blade, inscribe the sigil of Noctifer upon the ground in front of the altar.
3. **Raise your arms and chant the following invocation**:

    "Noctifer, Bringer of Night and Shadows,
    Lord of the Void and Sovereign of Secrets,
    To you, I call upon in this hallowed gathering,
    Grant me thy presence, wisdom, and strength,
    I offer you my blood, my devotion,
    To walk with you in the shadows,
    Noctifer, accept my call and manifest."

Note: The chant should be repeated three times, in a trance-like state, ensuring the evocation of Noctifer's presence.

Offering and Ethereal Manipulation Techniques:

1. Pour the chalice containing the offering over the sigil, stating your personal intention, i.e. what knowledge or guidance you seek from Noctifer, and your loyalty to his service.
2. Focus your energy through your dominant hand and trace a spiral around the sigil, concentrating on drawing Noctifer's energy into the ritual space.
3. Following the successful evocation, maintain an open, receptive state to receive any messages or visions from Noctifer, transcribing them on your parchment with the quill and ink.
4. Once you've received the desired knowledge or guidance, express your gratitude to Noctifer and firmly state your intention to close the channel, gathering the released energies, and directing them into the candle flame, extinguishing it as a sign of closure.

Closing the Ritual:

1. Carefully collect all ritual tools and materials, placing them in a storage specifically dedicated to your work with Noctifer.
2. Cleanse the ritual space by sprinkling saltwater, symbolizing the banishment of any lingering energies.
3. Express gratitude to the dark forces, and to Noctifer specifically, for their guidance and presence in the ritual. Contemplate the newly acquired knowledge and how to honorably utilize it in your path.

This intricate Sabbat ritual is designed to evoke and commune with a powerful entity from the dark pantheon and facilitate growth in esoteric knowledge and guidance. Faithfully following the ceremonial preparations, ritual tools, invocations, and offerings will ensure a successful and transformative experience.
