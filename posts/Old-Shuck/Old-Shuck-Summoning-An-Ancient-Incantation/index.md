excerpt: >
  Compose a dark and haunting Old Shuck-inspired chant, incorporating ancient lore and ghastly legends for a ritualistic ceremony designed to summon the ominous black dog. Include rhythmic repetitions and vivid imagery related to the spectral hound's shadowy presence, its portentous howls, and its ominous red eyes that pierce through the darkness. Ensure that the chant has a sinister tone and progressively builds in intensity, ultimately invoking the ominous spirit of Old Shuck.

In the shadows of the blackened night,
Where ancient evil holds its might,
A spectral hound of legend's lore,
Old Shuck we seek, forevermore.

Chorus:
Old Shuck awake, the darkness call,
A haunting howl, our souls enthralled.
Ominous beast, with eyes of red,
Summon forth, to us you're led.

From the depths of doom, an eerie growl,
Old Shuck's presence, we seek to prowl.
With fur as black as night's abyss,
His monstrous form, we dare not miss.

Chorus:
Old Shuck awake, the darkness call,
A haunting howl, our souls enthralled.
Ominous beast, with eyes of red,
Summon forth, to us you're led.

The Devil's hound, by shores and moors,
Fearful hearts, its presence gnaws.
Eternal scars, Old Shuck leaves behind,
As those it hunts, shall never find.

Chorus:
Old Shuck awake, the darkness call,
A haunting howl, our souls enthralled.
Ominous beast, with eyes of red,
Summon forth, to us you're led.

Infernal realms, the howling wind,
The ceremony of dread begins.
By the power of the ancient rites,
We summon thee on this cursed night.

Old Shuck awake, the darkness call,
A haunting howl, our souls enthralled.
Ominous beast, with eyes of red,
Summon forth, to us you're led.

Chanting louder, the ritual unfolds,
The atmosphere, a chill now holds.
In the distance, the darkness stirs,
An omen of the black dog's curse.

Chorus:
Old Shuck awake, the darkness call,
A haunting howl, our souls enthralled.
Ominous beast, with eyes of red,
Summon forth, to us you're led.

Piercing the veil, our voices rise,
Old Shuck's spirit materialize.
Fearful beast, now by our side,
Our darkest desires, we cannot hide.

Chorus:
Old Shuck awake, the darkness call,
A haunting howl, our souls enthralled.
Ominous beast, with eyes of red,
Summon forth, now to us led.
