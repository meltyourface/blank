Introducing the "Spiral of Eternity" Tarot Spread, an intricate, spiritually-relevant spread designed to explore the depths of past life experiences. This spread consists of 13 card positions, addressing karmic lessons, soul connections and significant events from previous incarnations, and can be enriched by the inclusion of unique elements such as crystals, runes, and other spiritual tokens. Here's how to perform the "Spiral of Eternity" Tarot Spread:

1. Begin by cleansing and consecrating your space using sage, Palo Santo, or incense.

2. Choose a comfortable spot where you can lay out the cards in a spiral pattern, starting from the center and moving outwards in a clockwise direction.

3. Place a clear quartz crystal, a grounding stone (e.g., hematite) and a celestial stone (e.g., labradorite) at the center of the spread. These crystals will help amplify your intention for past life exploration and provide a strong spiritual connection.

4. As you shuffle your tarot deck, focus on your intention to uncover past life experiences. When you feel ready, lay out the cards in the following order:
 a. Card 1: The Soul's Origin - Represents your soul's creation and innate spiritual essence.
 b. Card 2: Karmic Lessons - Represents the key karmic lessons you've experienced throughout your past lives.
   c. Card 3: Soul Connections - Represents significant soulmates and karmic associations from your previous incarnations.
 d. Card 4: Past Life Profession - Signifies the main career or work-related interest you had in a previous life.
 e. Card 5: Past Life Environment - Depicts the social and cultural setting of a significant past life.
 f. Card 6: Spiritual Progress - Highlights your spiritual development and achievements throughout your past lives.
 g. Card 7: Past Life Relationships - Represents important relationships from past lives that have influenced your current experiences.
 h. Card 8: Karmic Strengths - Signifies positive qualities, skills, and abilities you've developed through past life experiences.
 i. Card 9: Karmic Challenges - Highlights the obstacles, struggles, and challenges you faced in past lives that still influence your current life.
 j. Card 10: Past Life Transition - Represents the experiences surrounding death, release, and transformation from one life to the next.
 k. Card 11: Spiritual Guidance - Depicts insights and wisdom from your higher self, spirit guides, or ancestors to help you integrate past life information.
 l. Card 12: Past Life Impact - This card signifies how your past life experiences shape your present life and the karmic patterns you now encounter.
 m. Card 13: Future Karmic Lessons - Indicates the karmic lessons and growth opportunities that are yet to be revealed in your future incarnations.

5. You can also include a bag of runes near the crystals and pick one before drawing each card to provide additional insights into your past life experiences.

6. Take time to contemplate and interpret the cards, connecting their meanings to your own life and seeking guidance from your higher self and spirit guides.

The "Spiral of Eternity" tarot spread is a powerful tool for understanding your past life experiences and how they shape your present life. Through this process, you can deepen your spiritual connection, explore karmic lessons, and uncover knowledge that has been hidden for centuries.
