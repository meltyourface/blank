To fully comprehend the connection and symbolic representation between the three roots of Yggdrasil, the Norns, and Seidr practice in terms of understanding the influence of past, present, and future on an individual's spiritual journey and destiny, it is essential to delve into the concepts of Norse mythology, the esoteric traditions it inhabits, and how these elements interconnect.

Yggdrasil is the cosmic tree in Norse mythology, which connects and sustains the nine realms of existence. The tree has three roots, each extending to a crucial well that plays a vital part in the spiritual journey of an individual. These roots can be conceptually related to the dimensions of time—past, present, and future—that shape destiny.

The three roots are connected to the following wells:

1. Urd's Well (Urðarbrunnr) represents the "past," as the well of fate and origins. Urd is also one of the Norns, the goddesses who govern fate, who is associated with the past. The spirits of the dead dwell in Hel, located near Urd's Well, which signifies the roots of a person's heritage and ancestry linked to their past.

2. Mimir's Well (Mímisbrunnr) symbolizes the "present," as the well of knowledge and wisdom. Mimir, the wise guardian of the well, gives wisdom to those who drink from it. Thus, Mimir's Well represents the learning and insights gained in the present moment based on the accumulated wisdom of past experiences.

3. Hvergelmir represents the "future," as the well of chaos, where the forces of darkness and light, life and death, and creation and destruction originate. Since the future is uncertain and always in flux, Hvergelmir reflects the ceaseless struggle between order and chaos that determines the destiny of all living beings.

The Norns—Urd (past), Verdandi (present), and Skuld (future)—tend to the three roots and weave the web of fate, known as the "Orlog," which outlines an individual's destiny. They exert influence over an individual's spiritual journey by shaping the connection between past experiences, present actions, and future possibilities.

Seidr practice, an ancient shamanic tradition within Norse spirituality, involves the manipulation of Orlog. The practitioners, known as "Volvas," possess the power to access knowledge of the past, gain insight into the present, and discern visions of the future. They can also interact with the spiritual world, particularly by seeking guidance from the Norns.

The connection between the three roots of Yggdrasil, the Norns, and Seidr practice is an allegory for comprehending how past, present, and future influence a person's spiritual journey and destiny. By understanding the significance of each root and the mysteries held by the Norns, those who engage in Seidr practice can traverse the paths of time, altering or maintaining the currents of destiny.

In summary, the symbolic representation of Yggdrasil's roots, the Norns, and Seidr practice entails the profound ties between an individual's past, present, and future in shaping their spiritual journey and destiny. By interacting with the forces that govern time and fate, one can gain a deeper understanding of their life's purpose, learn from the accumulated wisdom of their heritage, and navigate the uncharted waters of the future.
