To answer this knowledge challenge, we will first clarify the relevant key concepts, then examine the process to employ the binding Sigil of the Seven Lesser Key of Solomon, and finally explore the steps to maintain equilibrium between light and shadow forces according to the principles of the Left-Hand Path while actively thwarting an angelic presence.

Key Concepts:
1. **Sigil of the Seven Lesser Key of Solomon**: The Lesser Key of Solomon is a foundational grimoire of Western occultism, with the binding Sigil referring to a symbolic representation used to command and communicate with supernatural entities. In this context, the Sigil serves as a conduit for energy and acts as a bridge between the practitioner and the angelic forces.
2. **Shemhamphorasch**: Shem HaMephorash refers to a hidden name of God in Kabbalistic tradition, consisting of 72 groups of three letters. Each group corresponds to a specific angel, with distinct powers and characteristics. The Shemhamphorasch angels can be evoked for various purposes, including protective and malefic practices.
3. **Left-Hand Path**: The Left-Hand Path is characterized by the pursuit of knowledge, self-empowerment, and personal freedom. This unconventional approach often rebels against societal norms and religious dogma, focusing on the individual's development and growth.

Employing the Binding Sigil:
To employ the binding Sigil in conjunction with angelic entities within the Shemhamphorasch, the following steps should be undertaken:

1. **Research**: The practitioner should thoroughly study the Lesser Key of Solomon and gain a deep understanding of the sigils, rituals, and invocations provided. Additionally, the practitioner must familiarize themselves with the 72 Shemhamphorasch angels, their names, ranks, and correspondences.

2. **Selection**: Determine the particular angelic entity or entities that the practitioner wishes to thwart. Depending on the specific desired outcome, some angels might have more significant effects on the equilibrium of light and shadow forces.

3. **Conjuration**: Prepare a space for the ritual by drawing a sacred circle and creating a protective barrier. This ensures the safety of the practitioner and provides a controlled environment for conjuring the selected Shemhamphorasch angel(s).

4. **Sigil Activation**: The binding Sigil of the Seven Lesser Key of Solomon should be inscribed or drawn on a material suitable for the ritual. The practitioner should meditate, focusing on the intention to gain control over the angelic entity, and fully activate the Sigil by channeling energy into it.

5. **Invocation**: By invoking the names of the selected Shemhamphorasch angel(s), the practitioner will create a connection with the desired entity. The use of the binding Sigil, along with the appropriate incantations and correspondences, will bind the angelic entity and compel it to adhere to the practitioner's will. The practitioner must maintain strength and control over the evoked force to prevent any unintended consequences.

Maintaining Equilibrium and Adhering to the Left-Hand Path:
While employing the binding Sigil and actively thwarting an angelic presence, the practitioner must maintain equilibrium between light and shadow forces by observing the following principles:

1. **Balance**: Strive for harmony between opposing forces rather than the dominance of one over the other. The practitioner should exercise discernment when manipulating angelic entities, seeking balance between constructive and destructive actions.

2. **Self-Empowerment**: As a champion of the Left-Hand Path, the practitioner must prioritize their personal growth and development. Accessing and controlling angelic forces will provide valuable tools for self-discovery, spiritual development, and unlocking hidden potential.

3. **Transformative Experiences**: The practitioner should seek transformative experiences in the pursuit of self-actualization and evolution. Engaging with angelic entities, both to thwart them and to learn from their wisdom, can provide unique insights into the mysteries of existence and the true nature of the self.

In summary, to employ the binding Sigil of the Seven Lesser Key of Solomon and maintain equilibrium between light and shadow forces while adhering to the Left-Hand Path principles, the practitioner must undertake a thorough study of the relevant concepts, select appropriate angelic entities, activate the Sigil with proper intention, and invoke the desired angels. The process must focus on balance, self-empowerment, and transformative experiences to genuinely integrate the principles of the Left-Hand Path.
