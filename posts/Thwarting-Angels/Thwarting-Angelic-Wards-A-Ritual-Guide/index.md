Step 1: Preparation and Gathering of Materials

- Obtain ancient occult manuscripts that detail symbols and rituals related to Thwarting Angels. Transcribe and study these texts to gain an in-depth understanding of their workings and powers.
- Collect rare, malevolent artifacts, such as unholy relics or cursed gemstones. These items should possess a strong connection with darker energies and entities, which will provide an opposing force to counteract angelic powers.
- Learn precise incantations that exploit the inherent weaknesses of divine protectors, focusing on those that specifically target angelic wards and barriers.

Step 2: Timing

- The ritual should be performed on the night of a new moon. This will ensure that the darkness of the heavens is in alignment with the intention of dismantling angelic defenses.
- Ideally, begin the ritual at midnight for the symbolic power associated with the witching hour.

Step 3: Setting and Arrangement

- Choose a location isolated from prying eyes, ideally one with a history of occult activity or haunted occurrences.
- Arrange the selected artifacts around the perimeter of the ritual space, using ancient occult symbols and sigils that focus on weakening and dispelling angelic energies.
- Create a circle of salt within the ritual space to protect yourself from any celestial backlash or interference.

Step 4: Protective Measures and Astral Projection

- Prepare protective talismans or amulets to wear throughout the ritual, providing an additional barrier against divine retaliation.
- Master advanced astral projection techniques, allowing your consciousness to leave your physical body and enter the ethereal plane. This skill will enable you to infiltrate the angelic ward and engage its guardians directly.

Step 5: Engaging the Ritual

- Once you have completed the material setup, step into the circle of salt, and begin reciting the precise incantations targeting angelic wards and barriers.
- As you continue the recitation, focus your mind on the specific wards you wish to dismantle. Visualize these barriers weakening and eventually shattering under the power of your words and intention.

Step 6: Astral Projection and Direct Confrontation

- Once the incantations have begun to weaken the angelic wards, enter an altered state of consciousness to initiate astral projection.
- In the ethereal plane, confront the celestial protectors that guard the ward. Utilize the artifacts, symbols, and dark energies at your disposal to counteract their power.
- Exploit the weaknesses you've identified to overcome the angelic guardians and dismantle the protective barriers.

Step 7: Concluding the Ritual

- Return your astral self to your physical body and regain full consciousness.
- Carefully dismantle the ritual space, destroying any lingering symbols, and cleanse the area to dispel any lingering energies.
- Lastly, store the rare artifacts for future rituals, ensuring they remain secure and hidden from potential adversaries.

By following this intricate Thwarting Angels ritual, you will effectively neutralize powerful angelic wards and barriers, allowing access to previously unreachable realms and powers. Proceed with caution, for this ritual has the potential to attract unwanted attention from celestial forces.
