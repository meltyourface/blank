The union of the microcosm and macrocosm.

In the context of Aleister Crowley's alchemical philosophy, the marriage of opposites, also known as the "Great Work," is represented by the union of the microcosm and macrocosm. This concept can be traced back to the Hermetic principle "As above, so below," which asserts that man, as a microcosm, is a reflection of the universe, the macrocosm. In other words, the microcosm represents the individual or human sphere, while the macrocosm represents the cosmos, the universe, and the divine level of existence. 

The idea of the marriage of opposites is a common theme in alchemy and many spiritual paths. It revolves around the notion of bringing together and unifying opposites, such as the masculine and feminine, light and darkness, conscious and unconscious, or physical and spiritual aspects of existence. By achieving this union, one is believed to be able to create a state of wholeness, enlightenment, and self-realization. 

The Great Work, in this context, refers to the ultimate goal of spiritual transformation, which can be achieved through the practice of alchemy and other esoteric sciences. For Crowley, the process of uniting these polarities within oneself leads to the dissolution of the ego, opening up a path for the individual to attain spiritual enlightenment and divine wisdom.

Let's briefly discuss the other options:

- Combining sulfur and quicksilver: In alchemy, sulfur represents the male principle, while quicksilver (mercury) represents the female principle. These substances do symbolize the union of opposites, but their combination alone doesn't encompass the entire process of the Great Work.

- Manifesting the Astral Light: The Astral Light is considered the subtle energy permeating the universe, acting as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. While working with the Astral Light is relevant to occult practices, it doesn't embody the marriage of opposites central to the Great Work.

- Reconciling the anima and animus within oneself: Anima and animus are Jungian concepts representing the inner feminine and masculine dimensions of an individual. While the reconciliation of these aspects is a form of integrating opposites, it is not specifically related to Aleister Crowley's alchemical philosophy and the Great Work.

In conclusion, the union of the microcosm and macrocosm is the representation of the marriage of opposites in Aleister Crowley's alchemical philosophy. It relates to the ultimate goal of spiritual transformation and self-realization achieved by uniting and harmonizing the contrasting aspects of existence.
