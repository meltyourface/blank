The correct answer is: The practice of Alchemy held both inner transformation and the physical manipulation of substances as interconnected aspects, with an ultimate aim of achieving a higher state of being.

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was an influential British occultist, mystic, and writer who founded the religious philosophy of Thelema. He was highly knowledgeable in various esoteric subjects, including alchemy. Crowley's interpretation of alchemy encompassed both spiritual and physical components and was focused primarily on the Great Work, the ultimate goal of attaining spiritual enlightenment.

Crowley viewed alchemy as a process of inner transformation, where the individual would work on purifying their soul and achieving a higher state of being. This idea is closely related to the concept of the Magnum Opus or the Great Work, which is a central tenet of alchemy. It combines spiritual and physical aspects into a unified worldview that seeks both self-discovery and an enhanced understanding of the underlying nature of reality.

Crowley's approach to alchemy is rooted in the Hermetic principles, which emphasize the interconnectedness of all things and the need for a balance between spirit and matter. He believed in the concept of "as above, so below," meaning that the microcosm of the individual is a reflection of the macrocosm of the universe as a whole. This concept is crucial to understanding the connections between the spiritual and physical aspects of alchemy as understood by Crowley.

In his writings and teachings, Crowley touches upon various aspects of alchemical practice, including the use of symbols, ceremonies, and rituals. These practices serve as tools for individuals to explore their inner selves and connect with the divine energy permeating the cosmos. They also help practitioners to understand and harness the fundamental energies of existence, which can be harnessed and transmuted for the achievement of the Great Work.

To summarize, Aleister Crowley's approach to alchemy was a holistic one, emphasizing the importance of both spiritual growth and physical manipulation of matter in the pursuit of a higher state of conscious being. Through the process of alchemy, individuals can attain the ultimate goal of the Great Work, which is the refinement and purification of the self, the discovery of cosmic truths, and the unification of the divine energies present in all things.
