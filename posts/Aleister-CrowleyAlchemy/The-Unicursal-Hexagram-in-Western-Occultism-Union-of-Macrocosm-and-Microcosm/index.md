Introduction

The Unicursal Hexagram, a sacred symbol frequently associated with Aleister Crowley's Thelema and Western occultism, carries deep significance and meaning. To fully understand its importance, we will explore its origins, the correlation between its geometric and mathematical properties, and how it relates to the Thelemic concepts of the microcosm and macrocosm's union.

Origins of the Unicursal Hexagram

The Unicursal Hexagram is a hexagram that is drawn in a continuous, unbroken line. This sets it apart from the traditional hexagram, which consists of two overlapping triangles, one pointing upwards, and the other pointing downwards. Kin to the Star of David within Jewish mysticism, the Unicursal Hexagram similarly connects two triangles, but in a singular, unbroken stroke.

Aleister Crowley, a prominent English occultist, and poet, adopted the Unicursal Hexagram as a symbol for his esoteric philosophy and religion called Thelema. It represents the union between the divine and the mortal, as well as the fusion between the macrocosm (the larger universe) and the microcosm (the individual human being).

Mathematical and Geometrical Properties of the Unicursal Hexagram

Examining the Unicursal Hexagram reveals its unique geometric and mathematical properties. It possesses six points, each of which is connected by a single, continuous line. This line can be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper, symbolizing the unbroken connection between seemingly disparate elements.

Each of the hexagramâ€™s triangles is an equilateral triangle, meaning that all three sides are equal in length. Also, the angles within each triangle measure 60 degrees.

One notable aspect of the Unicursal Hexagram's geometry is that it is comprised of a series of overlapping polygons. Alongside the equilateral triangles, a hexagon is formed where the two triangles overlap. Thus, the symbol carries multiple layers of geometric significance.

The Unicursal Hexagram and Thelemic Concepts

The Unicursal Hexagram serves as a powerful symbol for the union between the macrocosm and the microcosm, which is a core concept within Thelema and other esoteric traditions. The interlocking triangles represent the harmonious integration of contradictory forces. The upward-pointing triangle represents the macrocosm, associated with the divine, celestial, and spiritual realms. In contrast, the downward-pointing triangle signifies the microcosm, symbolizing the earthly, human, and material aspects.

The symbol captures the essence of "as above, so below," which expresses the idea that the divine principles governing the cosmos are also at play within the individual human being. This principle is central to the study of Alchemy, which seeks to transmute base substances into more refined or exalted forms, reflecting the inner transformation that occurs within an individual as they strive for spiritual enlightenment.

In the context of Crowley's Thelema, the Unicursal Hexagram also endorses the idea of uniting opposites, transcending dualities and embracing the inherent unity of existence. This symbol underscores the core Thelemic doctrine, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," which implies that by aligning our actions with our True Will, we harmonize with the greater divine Will pervading the macrocosm.

Key Themes, Ideas, and Conclusions

The Unicursal Hexagram is a sacred symbol within Aleister Crowley's Thelema, embodying the harmonious union between the macrocosm and microcosm. Its unique geometric and mathematical properties exemplify the interconnectivity and interdependence of all elements within reality. The Unicursal Hexagram highlights the fundamental Thelemic doctrine that the individual, when aligned with their True Will, can mirror, and ultimately realize, the divine principles governing the universe. In doing so, they transcend dualities and embrace the inherent unity of existence.
