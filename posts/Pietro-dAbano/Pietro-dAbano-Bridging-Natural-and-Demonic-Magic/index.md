Pietro d'Abano, an Italian philosopher, physician, and astrologer, was a prominent figure in the 13th and early 14th centuries. He was a pioneer of medical astrology, who sought to bridge the gap between science and magic. His works, such as Conciliator differentiarum philosophorum et praecipue medicorum and Heptameron, reveal his perspectives on the connections and distinctions between natural magic and demonic magic.

Natural magic and demonic magic, according to Pietro d'Abano, shared some commonalities but had fundamental differences. Natural magic was a form of knowledge that utilized nature's powers and the inherent qualities of beings and substances. It rested on the belief that by manipulating the natural world, one could produce wondrous effects. Natural magic was thus built on a foundation of natural philosophy and empirical observation.

In contrast, demonic magic, also known as necromancy or goetia, involved the summoning, control, and manipulation of demons or spirits to achieve specific aims. This form of magic required practitioners to enter into pacts or agreements with supernatural beings, often at the cost of one's soul or moral integrity.

In the Conciliator differentiarum, Pietro d'Abano sought to reconcile apparent contradictions within and between diverse philosophical and medical systems, including those related to the realms of natural magic and demonic magic. His work emphasizes the importance of reason and empirical observation, with a strong commitment to the Aristotelian worldview and the integration of Greco-Arabic science.

The Heptameron, erroneously attributed to Pietro d'Abano but closely related to his thinking, is a grimoire that outlines a system of planetary and angelic magic, drawing upon Kabbalistic, Hermetic, and astrological traditions. Although it involves the invocation of celestial powers, it avoids the more nefarious associations of demonic magic.

Pietro d'Abano's ideas sparked a great deal of controversy and debate in the late medieval and early Renaissance eras. His works were deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, leading to his arrest and imprisonment. His attempts to synthesize diverse fields of knowledge and explore the boundaries between natural and demonic magic ultimately contributed to his reputation as both a respected scholar and a dangerous subversive.

His influence on subsequent philosophers and occultists was significant, especially during the Renaissance. Such figures as Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, and Giordano Bruno were deeply inspired by d'Abano's ideas, engaging in their own attempts to integrate magic, astrology, and natural philosophy within a context that gradually became more open to unconventional thinking.

The demographic and cultural factors that contributed to Pietro d'Abano's unique stance on magic were manifold. His hometown of Abano Terme, near Padua, was a thriving center of learning and culture during his time, situated at the crossroads of Islamic, Jewish, and Christian intellectual traditions. Additionally, the rise of European universities and the translation of key texts from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew into Latin provided a broader framework for the dissemination and development of magical and philosophical ideas.

In conclusion, Pietro d'Abano's perspective on the connections and distinctions between natural magic and demonic magic demonstrates the complex ways in which these traditions were intertwined in the late medieval and early Renaissance periods. His commitment to a philosophically grounded, empirical approach to the exploration of magic and the natural world helped to pave the way for a more humanistic and integrative worldview, while his controversial ideas also provoked serious challenges to the established religious and intellectual orthodoxy.
