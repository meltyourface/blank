2. **Method of Interpretation**:

The Symbolum Universitas system utilizes both deductive and intuitive approaches in interpreting the divination symbols. Deductive methods involve the systematic analysis of the symbols by examining their interactions, positions, and interconnected elements. Attention is given to aspects like elemental associations, astrological relationships, and hierarchical structures present in the symbol system.

Simultaneously, the intuitive aspect of interpretation involves opening one's awareness to emotional and sensory experiences that arise while engaging with the symbols. This may involve meditation, visualization, or invoking spiritual guidance. Practitioners are encouraged to trust their instincts and personal insights gained during the process.

3. **Comprehensive Guide**:

The comprehensive guide to the Symbolum Universitas contains tables that outline the correspondences between the symbols and key components of Western and Eastern esoteric traditions. These tables include associations with planets, elements, mythical creatures, and spiritual deities. Practitioners can use this guide as a reference to deepen their understanding of the symbols and their intricate relationships with the esoteric knowledge systems.

4. **Participatory Epistemological Approach**:

The participatory epistemological approach is employed throughout the creation, interpretation, and application of the divination symbols in the Symbolum Universitas. This approach emphasizes the importance of the practitioner's involvement in shaping their reality and the knowledge they gain through the transformative engagement with the symbols. Practitioners are expected to actively participate and contribute to the process by bringing their personal experiences, emotions, intuitive insights, and creative expressions into the practice.

5. **Sample Reading**:

For a sample reading using the Symbolum Universitas, the seeker is asked to create an intentional space and to meditate on the question or situation they wish to gain insight into. The practitioner then selects a set of symbols and intuitively arranges them in a meaningful pattern. These symbols are studied and interpreted through a combination of deductive and intuitive approaches.

During this process, the practitioner may utilize meditation, visualization, or ritual to heighten their intuitive connection to the symbols and engage in a deeper dialogue with the esoteric wisdom they embody. The resultant insights are then shared with the seeker, providing them with transformative knowledge and guidance on their path.
