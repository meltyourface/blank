To tackle this knowledge challenge, let us begin by breaking down the various components and then synthesize them to achieve a comprehensive understanding of Ducking in terms of its esoteric and occult significance. **We will explore**:

1. Ducking's role in witchcraft trials during the early modern period
2. The Hermetic principle "as above, so below"
3. The significance of water in alchemy and occult rituals

1. **Ducking in Witchcraft Trials**:
In the early modern period, Ducking was a widespread practice used to identify whether a person was a witch or not. A suspected witch was tied and submerged into water, and if they floated, they were deemed guilty of practicing witchcraft due to the belief that water, a pure element, would reject the witch. Conversely, if they sank and drowned, this was seen as their innocence being proven. Socio-politically, the trials served to enforce control, often targeting marginalized individuals, specifically women. 

2. "As Above, So Below" - The Hermetic Principle:
The principle of correspondence, "As above, so below" is derived from the Emerald Tablet - a foundational text of Hermeticism and alchemy. This principle posits that everything in the universe is connected and that whatever happens on a large scale is mirrored on a smaller scale, or vice versa. In other words, events and actions in the macrocosm will have corresponding consequences in the microcosm. Connecting this principle to Ducking highlights the interplay between the physical world and higher realms, indicating that the act of Ducking is inherently linked to larger cosmic forces.

3. **The Significance of Water in Alchemy and Occult Rituals**:
In alchemy, water is one of the four classical elements representing emotion, intuition, and the subconscious. Water has symbolic associations with purity, transformation, and rebirth. In occult rituals, water is often used for cleansing and purification, removing undesirable energies and allowing for the emergence of new states of being.

Synthesizing these facets helps us build an insightful, occult understanding of Ducking. Firstly, Ducking utilized the purifying nature of water to identify individuals labeled as witches through the process. In this context, Ducking was not only a sociopolitical tool but also a ritualistic enactment of purification and transformation, intertwined with alchemical and occult principles.

The Hermetic principle "as above, so below" suggests that Ducking reflected a correspondence between the terrestrial realm and the celestial or spiritual dimensions. Ducking served as an outward manifestation of the cosmic forces and spiritual beliefs of that era. As believed by the individuals during the early modern period, Ducking not only aimed to purify society by removing the presumed evil but also aimed to maintain balance on a metaphysical level by eliminating the disruptive presence of witches.

Finally, the element of water, in this convergence of esoteric ideas, carries a dual meaning. While it represents purification, it also symbolizes the suffering that suspected witches endured. In a broader sense, this convergence showcases the intense interplay between enlightenment and persecution in the sociopolitical landscape and religious beliefs of the early modern period.

To summarize, the intricate connections between Ducking, witchcraft trials, alchemy, and the Hermetic principle exemplify the convergence of sociopolitical and metaphysical forces during the early modern period. Ducking emerges as a deeply symbolic practice, reflecting humanity's desire for purity and control, while simultaneously unveiling the darker side of persecution. Understanding these complex relationships between Ducking and its esoteric facets gives us profound insights into the dynamics of societal belief systems, spiritual connections, and individual experiences in this unique and often misunderstood historical period.
