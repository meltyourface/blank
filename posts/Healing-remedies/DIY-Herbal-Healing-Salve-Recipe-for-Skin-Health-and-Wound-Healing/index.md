1. Select three medicinal herbs: 
- Calendula (Calendula officinalis): Known for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties, calendula is an optimal herb for promoting skin regeneration and preventing infection.
- Plantain (Plantago major): An excellent herb for skin irritations, plantain possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial properties, making it ideal for soothing and healing wounds, insect bites, and rashes.
- Comfrey (Symphytum officinale): With its ability to accelerate wound healing and improve skin elasticity, comfrey is perfect for reducing inflammation, relieving pain, and promoting skin health.

2. Ideal Ratios:
Use a ratio of 1:1:1 for calendula, plantain, and comfrey, ensuring that each herb contributes equally to the salve's potent healing qualities and synergistic effect.

3. Benefits of carrier oils:
- Sweet Almond Oil: Lightweight, easily absorbed by the skin, and nourishing, sweet almond oil is rich in vitamins A, E, and B, as well as fatty acids.
- Olive Oil: A more robust option known for its antioxidants and anti-inflammatory effects, olive oil penetrates deeper into the skin for lasting nourishment.
- Jojoba Oil: Mimicking the skin's natural sebum, this fast-absorbing oil is ideal for those with oily or sensitive skin types.

For this particular recipe, sweet almond oil is recommended due to its lightweight properties and quick absorption.

4. Essential oils:
- Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia): Improving the overall scent and providing additional therapeutic benefits, lavender essential oil is compatible with the chosen herbs and carrier oil. It possesses antibacterial and calming properties, making it an ideal addition to the healing salve.

5. Step-by-step process for infusing the herbs into the carrier oil:
a. Finely grind 1 part each of calendula, plantain, and comfrey.
b. Combine 3 parts sweet almond oil with the herb mixture in a double boiler or slow cooker.
c. Gently heat the mixture on low for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally to ensure proper extraction of the herbs' medicinal properties. Do not let the mixture boil.
d. After the infusion process, strain the oil through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove any remaining herbal particles.
e. Reserve the infused oil for the next step of making the healing salve.

6. Preserving the healing salve:
a. In a double boiler, gently heat the infused oil.
b. Add 1 part beeswax (or an alternative like candelilla wax for a vegan option) to the infused oil.
c. Melt the wax completely, stirring the mixture well.
d. Remove from heat and add 5-10 drops of lavender essential oil per 4 oz of the salve (adjust according to preference).
e. Pour the mixture into sterilized containers, such as glass jars or metal tins, and allow it to cool and solidify.
f. Store the healing salve in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. The shelf life is approximately 1-2 years, but its potency will be highest within the first 6-12 months.
