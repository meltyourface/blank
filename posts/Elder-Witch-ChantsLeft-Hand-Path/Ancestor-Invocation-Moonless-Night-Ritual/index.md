## Invocation of the Ancestral Shadows

### I. Ritual Preparations
Before commencing this invocation, prepare your sanctuary by enshrouding it in complete darkness. Incense composed of wormwood, opium, and myrrh shall suffuse the air. At the center of your space, upon the ground form a circle of ash and salt, with a pentagram inscribed within. In the midst of the pentagram, place a chalice filled with nightshade, hemlock, and pomegranate juice.

Surrounding the circle, place five obsidian stones at each point of the pentagram, serving as a vessel for the spirits. Upon each of these stones, inscribe symbols representing the primary elements: earth, air, fire, water, and spirit.

Ensure to collect the following relics during a moonless night: a lock of hair entwined with the root of the hallowed dead, the sharpened talon of a raven, and the fang of a serpent.

### II. The Incantation
Begin the invocation at the stroke of midnight.
**Step into the circle and kneel at its center. Hold the lock of the hair with the root entwined, the raven's talon, and the serpent's fang in your left hand. Raise your right hand skyward. Whisper the initial verse**:

"Lurid est nova aurora, tempus umbrae vitae,
Decimat ter noctem, speculis ab ignotis,
Callidus vocamus vos, progredientibus tenebris,
Instar avium umbrae, ascendite, clamamus."

### III. The Esoteric Gestures
Retain the relics in your left hand and perform the following gestures:

1. Form a fist with your right hand and strike upon your heart thrice.
2. With your right arm extended, trace the shape of an inverted triangle in the air.
3. Swirl both arms around your head and point your right hand toward the ground, fingers spread wide.

### IV. Oblations and Continuation of the Incantation
Place the lock of hair upon the talon and fang within the chalice and recite the continuation of the incantation:

"In silentio, relinquite locus mortalium,
Circuli praeteritorum, modis caecis supra,
Inflammat cor vestrum, pah oblati offerimus,
Transgreditur, custodes, linquimus has potestatis."

### V. Final Steps and Ancestral Manifestation
Immerse your left hand into the chalice, coating the relics in the elixir. **Raise the dripping artifacts above your head and speak the final verse**:

"Ex mors, ad vitam, o ancesirales umbrarum,
Venite nobiscum, nocte profunda loqui,
Meus sanguis confluit, rivum meminit nomen vestrum,
Aperire portas, anima majorum, laudem ac tenebris."

Upon completion, the ancestral spirits shall manifest themselves. Be prepared to receive their wisdom and guidance and remember to thank them before embracing their return into the unknown void.
