Within the verdant realm where dreams do weave,
A tale unfolds of harvest's hallowed eve;
A devotional chant to summon grace,
From Mae Phosop, mother of sweet embrace.

Awaken the winds that ripple through jade,
A tapestry of emerald serenade;
Mystic enchantress of burgeoning life,
Allay the fields of toil and farmers' strife.

The fertile earth, your verdant canvas waits,
A budding tapestry for you to create;
Whisper to the tillers of this land,
And bless the labor done by humble hands.

With sacred incense of the fragrant grove,
We summon thee, with passion and with love;
From celestial realms and skies above,
Descend with mercy and abundance's flood.

O consecrated dance of Mother Earth,
A cosmic ballet of celestial birth;
Caress the bosom of the verdant plain,
Let abundance sprout and life regain.

Offerings we lay upon your throne,
Golden fruits and rice, of sweetest tone;
Cooing doves and gifts of greenest leaf,
We yearn for blessings, O mother of relief.

In dreamlike scenes of mystical embrace,
Your tendrils intertwine with earthly grace;
From the depths of time, a tale unfolds,
As ancient stalks of verdant rice take hold.

With horns and drums, we dance around the Pyre,
The flames burn bright, a testament to desire;
As we plead, with ardent hearts we pray,
Bestow the gifts of harvest to our sway.

In spirit realms where only dreams dare guide,
The riddles of your blessings we confide;
With every verdant wisp that feeds the soil,
Your touch sustains the fruits of mortal toil.

Mae Phosop, goddess of the harvest yield,
In your bountiful embrace, serenity is sealed;
The elemental forces gather near,
A symphony of nature's bounty, we revere.

Through ethereal verse and sacred chant,
A tale unfolds, enchanting and enchant;
In the realm of Mae Phosop's opulent trance,
We humbly seek the wonders of abundance's dance.
