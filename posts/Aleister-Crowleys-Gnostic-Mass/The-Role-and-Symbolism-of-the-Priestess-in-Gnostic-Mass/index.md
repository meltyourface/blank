3. She embodies the feminine divine, playing an integral role in the consecration of the Eucharist and the enactment of the divine union.

In Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass, also known as Liber XV, the Priestess personifies the feminine aspect of divinity, known as Nuit, the goddess of the night sky. In contrast, the Priest represents the masculine aspect, Hadit, the point at the center of all possible experiences. Together, they symbolize the union of opposites, embodying the divine creative power that brings forth new life.

The Gnostic Mass is a ritual designed to celebrate the mysteries of existence by enacting the divine union of the cosmic principles of the masculine and feminine. The ceremony is structured around the core symbolism of the Egyptian myth of Isis and Osiris, intertwined with influences from varied religious and esoteric traditions. This union, in turn, symbolizes the principle of "love under will," which is a central concept in Thelema, the spiritual philosophy founded by Crowley.

The role of the Priestess in the Gnostic Mass is not merely symbolic; she actively participates in the ritual to facilitate and enact the divine union. One of her primary responsibilities is to consecrate the Eucharist, a sacramental act that commemorates and reenacts the divine mysteries of creation through the union of the masculine and feminine energies.

During the course of the ritual, the Priestess performs several important functions. She consecrates and purifies the temple space, invokes the divine forces, and unveils herself to the Priest, symbolizing the revelation of the divine to humanity. Moreover, she assists the Priest in the consummation of their sacred marriage - both ritualistically and symbolically - and plays an active part in the distribution of the Eucharist to the congregation.

The Gnostic Mass and the role of the Priestess within it can be understood as an enactment of the Hermetic principle of "As above, so below." In this context, the ritual serves as a reminder that the spiritual and material worlds are interconnected, and the workings of the cosmos can be observed and understood through the symbolism and actions performed within the confines of the temple.

In conclusion, option 3 accurately reflects the role of the Priestess in the Gnostic Mass. As a representation of the feminine divine, she is an essential participant in the enactment of the divine union, contributing to the consecration of the Eucharist and the spiritual transformation of the congregation. Through her presence and actions, the Priestess helps to reveal and manifest the mysteries of existence, bringing together the spiritual and material realms in a harmonious union that serves as a reminder of the underlying unity of all things.
