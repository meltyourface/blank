In order to address this knowledge challenge, we will first establish the fundamental tenets of Thelemic philosophy and the significance of the Gnostic Mass. We will then discern the symbolic correlations between the Priestess and the Scarlet Woman, explain their roles within Thelemic philosophy, and examine how their interactions with the Priest and other elements of the ritual embody the essential aspects of the Great Work.

Aleister Crowley's Thelemic philosophy is rooted in the central tenet "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," promoting the idea of finding one's True Will or purpose in life and pursuing it. The Gnostic Mass, also known as Liber XV, is a central ritual and public celebration of Thelema, representing the union of opposites, the affirmation of spiritual aspiration, and the ultimate transcendence to achieve union with the Divine.

The Gnostic Mass contains several key roles, including the Priest, the Priestess, and the Deacon, as well as the roles of the Children. Among these roles, the Priestess and the Scarlet Woman hold significant symbolic value in the overall structure and philosophy of the ritual.

The Priestess is the feminine aspect within the Gnostic Mass, symbolizing the divine feminine, receptive, and creative energies. She represents the human soul (Nephesh in the Qabalistic system) that must undergo a transformative process to ascend and unite with the Divine. Additionally, the Priestess embodies the concept of Nuit, the Egyptian goddess of the night sky, representing infinite possibilities and the limitless expanse of potentiality.

The Scarlet Woman, on the other hand, is an embodiment of Babalon, a central figure in Crowley's Thelema as an aspect of the divine feminine, closely related to the traditional idea of the Whore of Babylon. She can be understood as the earthly manifestation of Nuit and the liberated and uninhibited sexual and creative energies. As the divine lover and bride, Babalon is the ultimate partner in the Great Work of spiritual alchemy, which leads to the union of the initiate with their own Holy Guardian Angel.

In the Gnostic Mass, the interactions between the Priestess and the Priest symbolize the union of opposites, often referred to as the Great Work or Alchemical Marriage. This union of opposites represents the reconciliation of dualities, such as the masculine and feminine, active and passive, and rational and emotional. During the ceremony, the Priestess participates in a series of rituals, which include the veiling and unveiling of the Priestess, signaling the transformative process of the soul towards enlightenment.

Furthermore, the Priestess acts as a conduit for the divine powers, transmitting the energies of Nuit and Babalon through her role as the chalice or graal. The act of consuming the sacraments (cakes of light and wine) prepared by the Priestess serves as a physical and symbolic manifestation of the Great Work, with participants integrating the divine energies and their own True Will.

In conclusion, the Priestess and the Scarlet Woman, as the feminine aspects within the Gnostic Mass, play crucial roles in representing the divine feminine and the energies necessary for the Great Work of spiritual alchemy. Their interactions with the Priest and other ritual elements symbolize the union of opposites, essential to attaining transcendence and union with the Divine. Through their roles, they exemplify key aspects of Aleister Crowley's Thelemic philosophy, particularly the integration of the individual's True Will and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment.
