To properly address the knowledge challenge posed, it is important to begin with an understanding of Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass, the central ritual of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and one of the most significant ceremonies in Thelema. The Gnostic Mass is a complex and powerful rite which encompasses a rich tapestry of esoteric symbolism. In this analysis, the focus will be on the intricate and interrelated symbolism of the Priest, Priestess and the Lance, their roles and transformations throughout the ritual, and how they contribute to the themes of divine union and the manifestation of the divine in the material world. 

The Gnostic Mass consists of a series of ritualistic encounters between the Priest, who represents the active, solar, and masculine entity, and the Priestess, embodying the receptive, lunar, and feminine elements of the divinity. The Lance, a phallic symbol, represents the power, spirituality, and guiding force of the male principle in the ceremony. Each of these elements undergoes transformations and changes in position during the course of the ritual, effectively demonstrating the interconnectivity of divine forces and their manifestation in material existence.

The role of the Priest in the Gnostic Mass is multifaceted. As mentioned, he represents the active, masculine aspect in the divine union. He begins the ritual in darkness and silence, signifying a state of potential energy, ready to be awakened by the divine feminine force. As the ritual progresses, the Priest rises, consecrates, and acknowledges the power of the Priestess, which sets the stage for the union of these divine energies.

The Priestess, on the other hand, is initially seated on the altar in silence and veiled, symbolizing her position as a vessel for divine wisdom waiting to be unveiled. This idea is derived from various goddess traditions, wherein the feminine force often represents knowledge or gnosis that is to be discovered. The myths of Isis and Sophia are notable examples. As she becomes unveiled and enthroned, the Priestess embodies the divine feminine principle of creation and fertility, actively playing a role in the manifestation of divine force in the material world.

The Lance assumes multiple significances and functions in the Gnostic Mass. From the perspective of sacred sexuality, it epitomizes the phallus utilized to fertilize and awaken the feminine energy represented by the Priestess. Additionally, the Lance signifies the spiritual power guiding the Priest in performing the ritual and manifesting divine energies within the temple. During the course of the ritual, the Lance interacts with both the Priest and the Priestess, signifying the interconnected nature of the divine masculine and feminine principles as they work together for the greater spiritual purpose.

The key transformative moment of the Gnostic Mass is the symbolic divine union between the Priest and the Priestess, referred to as the "Gnostic and Sacred Marriage" enacted by the Lance's interaction with the chalice. Through this ritualistic act, both forces unite, culminating in the consecration of the Eucharist â€“ a material representation of divine energies. With this comes the manifestation of the divine in the material world, as the participants consume the Eucharist, effectively internalizing a portion of the divine force and unlocking their own inner potential.

In conclusion, the Gnostic Mass, through the interrelated symbolism of the Priest, Priestess, and the Lance, demonstrates a complex and comprehensive narrative of divine union and the manifestation of the divine in the material world. Key themes such as duality, transformation, and interconnectedness are explored as the Priest, Priestess, and Lance alter positions and roles throughout the ritual. The culmination of this divine interplay results in the cathartic enactment of the sacred marriage, ultimately leading to the consecration and assimilation of the Eucharist, whereby divine energies are absorbed by the individual inhabitants of the material world.
