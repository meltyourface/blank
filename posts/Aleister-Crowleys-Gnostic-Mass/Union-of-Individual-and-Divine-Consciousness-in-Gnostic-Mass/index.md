The answer is: Union of the Microcosm and Macrocosm.

In the context of Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass, the Priestess's transformation into the High Altar is laden with symbolism related to the union of the microcosm (the individual consciousness and personal experience) and the macrocosm (the cosmos, or the collective unconscious and universal experience). The Gnostic Mass, or Liber XV, is a central ritual of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) and Thelema—a mystical, spiritual path founded by Crowley.

**The Gnostic Mass comprises several key figures**: the Priest, the Priestess, the Deacon, and the two Children. The High Altar, located at the eastern end of the temple space, is of primary importance, symbolizing the spiritual goal of the ritual. The Priestess's transformation into the High Altar signifies a shift in focus from the individual level of consciousness to the divine, macrocosmic reality.

This transformation is underscored by the sacred act of the Priestess unveiling the High Altar and crowning herself with a mitre adorned with the word "BABALON." Babalon represents the divine female archetype, the Great Mother, the embodiment of the macrocosmic forces of the universe. The Priestess, then, unites the personal—microcosmic—experience of the worshippers with the divine—macrocosmic—reality through her transformative self-identification with Babalon.

The concept of union between microcosm and macrocosm is essential in Western esoteric traditions, particularly in Hermeticism. The famous Hermetic axiom "As above, so below" captures this idea succinctly. By aligning themselves with the forces of the macrocosm, individuals participating in the Gnostic Mass symbolically transcend their own limited experience and encounter a greater, universal understanding of their spiritual journey.

The Priestess's transformation also echoes the symbolism in the Tarot, wherein the High Priestess card, representing spiritual wisdom and the intuition necessary to achieve spiritual union, bridges the gap between the terrestrial and divine realms. In essence, the High Priestess serves as a microcosmic conduit for participants to access the macrocosmic wisdom of the cosmic consciousness.

To summarize, the Priestess's transformation into the High Altar in Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass symbolizes the union of the microcosm and macrocosm, facilitating the spiritual transcendency of the participants in that holy space. The ritual aims to guide individuals on their path to enlightenment and empowerment by providing a living experience of this cosmic union.
