The correct answer is: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

In Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass, the three major roles performed by the Priestess, Priest, and the Children represent important elements symbolically within the ritual. The Priestess embodies the goddess Nuit, the Priest represents the god Hadit, and the Children are considered to be the offspring of Nuit and Hadit, specifically the god Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

Nuit is the infinite, the space of possibility and potential, often associated with the night sky. She is considered the mother of all things and is symbolized by the stretching of her body over the heavens. Hadit, on the other hand, is the complement to Nuit â€“ the infinitely small point, representing the individual and the experience of life. Ra-Hoor-Khuit is the active aspect that unites the infinite and the individual, and through his manifestation, the Divine Will is expressed.

The roles of the Priestess, Priest, and the Children work together in the Gnostic Mass to help participants access the divine. By acting out these roles and engaging with the ritual, participants aim to unite the infinite potential of Nuit with the personal experience of Hadit, and through the intervention of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, allow their Divine Will to manifest.

The other options offered, while containing relevant concepts to Thelema or the occult in general, are not specifically represented by the Priestess, Priest, and the Children in the context of the Gnostic Mass.

The Supernal Triad, Sephiroth, and the Four Worlds are Kabbalistic concepts that, although influential in Thelema and the occult, do not explicitly represent the roles mentioned.

The three alchemical principles of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury represent different aspects of matter and consciousness. While important in the larger context of Hermeticism and the Western esoteric tradition, they do not specifically symbolize the roles of the Priestess, Priest, and the Children within Crowley's Gnostic Mass.

The processes of theoria, praxis, and gnosis are concepts related to spiritual development within various religious and esoteric traditions. Theoria refers to contemplation, praxis to spiritual practice, and gnosis to direct experiential knowledge of the divine. While these concepts can be applied to the Gnostic Mass, they do not explicitly correspond to the roles of the Priestess, Priest, and the Children.

In conclusion, the key elements symbolically represented by the Priestess, Priest, and the Children in Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass are Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. The ritual aims to unite these cosmic forces to enable participants to access and manifest their Divine Will.
