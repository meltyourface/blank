Answer: She embodies the divine feminine principle and channels spiritual energy through her body for use in the ceremony.

**Explanation**: In Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass, the Priestess plays a crucial role in the performance of the ritual as a representation of the divine feminine principle, or Nuit. This principle balances the divine masculine principle, embodied by the Priest (Hadit), and together they represent the dual aspects of divinity.

The Gnostic Mass is a highly symbolic ritual, with roots in Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and the philosophy of Thelema, which was founded by Crowley. It aims to achieve a union between the individual and the divine, often expressed as a mystical union between the microcosm (the self) and the macrocosm (the universe).

Throughout the ceremony, the Priestess embodies the goddess Nuit, who is considered the infinite expanse of the sky and the source of all creation in Thelemic mythology. Nuit represents the limitless potential of the universe; she is the mother of all and contains everything within her. As a conduit for spiritual energy, the Priestess allows this divine feminine force to flow through her and channels it during the ceremony, primarily through her interaction with the Priest.

During the ritual, the Priestess enacts a series of symbolic gestures, which serve to consecrate the space and the participants, as well as to invoke divine energy. Her most important action is the unveiling of the holy grail, symbolizing the womb of the goddess and the source of all life. Then, with the Priest, she performs the "Great Rite" or the "mystery of the sacred marriage" – a symbolic union of the divine masculine and feminine principles that aims to facilitate the participant's spiritual awakening or enlightenment.

Thus, the role of the Priestess in the Gnostic Mass is essential in representing the divine feminine and channeling spiritual energy through her body for use in the ceremony. The balance between the two opposing forces – masculine and feminine – creates a dynamic, transformative energy, ultimately leading to spiritual realization and the experience of divine presence.
