To design an original altar for the Gnostic Mass, we must first understand the core tenets of Aleister Crowley's Gnostic Mass and the stages it embodies. The Gnostic Mass is a central ritual in Thelema, a spiritual philosophy established by Crowley, which aims to unite the individual with their divine nature by utilizing ceremonial magic, symbolism, and secret knowledge. The main stages of the Gnostic Mass are: 

1. The Preparation of the Temple and the Altar
2. The Purification and Consecration
3. The Mass of the Catechumen
4. The Mass of the Faithful
5. The Final Benediction

Bearing this understanding in mind, let's create an original altar design that incorporates at least five essential elements symbolizing key aspects of the ritual. 

1. Central Hexagonal Altar: The central altar can be designed in the shape of a hexagon, signifying the union of the macrocosm (celestial forces) with the microcosm (human consciousness). Each edge of the hexagon represents one of the six core elements: air, water, fire, earth, spirit, and the divine union. These elements correspond to the various energies summoned during the stages of the Mass, ultimately bringing the celebrant closer to their divine nature.

2. A Smoky Quartz Crystal: Place a smoky quartz crystal at the heart of the altar to symbolize the purification process that occurs during the Gnostic Mass. Smoky quartz is known for its grounding energy, facilitating the cleansing of unwanted negative energies and attachments during the Purification and Consecration stage. This crystal serves as a focal point for the celebrant's intention to purify their being, both physically and spiritually.

3. A Chalice and a Paten: As key instruments of the ritual, a chalice and a paten are placed on the altar. The chalice represents the feminine energies and the element of water, while the paten (plate) symbolizes the masculine energies and the element of earth. These tools are used during the Mass of the Catechumen and the Mass of the Faithful for the consecration of the Eucharist, symbolizing the union of opposites, and the internal alchemical transformation that the celebrant aspires to achieve.

4. Incense Burner and Censer: Positioned on opposite sides of the altar, these items symbolize the elements fire and air, respectively. The incense burner houses the flame that signifies the divine spark within each person, representing the Light of the Gnosis. The censer releases fragrant smoke, signifying our prayers and intentions rising to the divine realms. The combination of these elements further signifies purification, consecration, and the transformative power of fire upon our spiritual journey.

5. The Rose and the Cross: Embellish the altar with rose petals arranged in a cross pattern. The rose represents the beauty, love, and compassion required for spiritual growth, while the cross symbolizes the intersection of the divine and human worlds, as well as the hardships one must endure to attain enlightenment. The Rose and the Cross form the emblematic core of Rosicrucianism and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, influential esoteric orders that impacted Crowley's Gnostic Mass.

In summary, this original altar design for the Gnostic Mass features a hexagonal central altar, a smoky quartz crystal, a chalice and a paten, an incense burner and censer, and a rose and cross arrangement. Each of these elements highlights connections between the stages of the Mass, as well as the core themes it encompasses: the union of the macrocosm and microcosm, purification and consecration, the interrelation of elemental forces, and the transformative journey that leads one to spiritual growth and enlightenment.
