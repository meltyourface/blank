In order to evaluate the significance of the Priestess's role in the Gnostic Mass, specifically in the context of Thelemic cosmology and the formula of Tetragrammaton, we need to first have a clear understanding of these key concepts. Thelemic cosmology refers to the philosophical, mythical, and mystical framework underpinning the religious system of Thelema, founded by Aleister Crowley. The formula of Tetragrammaton is a key concept in both Thelemic and broader Western occultism, representing the four-letter name of the God of Israel â€“ YHVH (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh). In this answer, we shall unpack the Priestess's role within these contexts and discuss its implications for individual and collective transformation.

### I. Thelemic Cosmology
Thelemic cosmology encompasses the concepts of Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Nuit, symbolized by the night sky, represents the infinite expansion, while Hadit, symbolized by a winged solar disk, signifies the infinitely condensed point. The union of these two principles gives birth to Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the solar god who embodies the central Thelemic concept of "Do what thou wilt."

### II. Formula of Tetragrammaton
The Tetragrammaton, or YHVH, in the context of Thelemic and occult interpretations, represents the process of creation and an understanding of divine principles. Each of the four letters corresponds to a specific element: Yod (Fire), Heh (Water), Vav (Air), and the final Heh (Earth). These elements also express the progression from the subtlest (Fire) to the densest (Earth), indicating a process of manifestation.

### III. The Priestess in the Gnostic Mass
The Gnostic Mass, or Liber XV, is a ritual performance under the Thelemic framework that seeks to actualize spiritual, psychological, and social transformation through the re-enactment of a divine drama. The main characters of the Gnostic Mass include the Priest, the Priestess, the Deacon, and the Congregation. The Priestess represents the Nuit principle in Thelemic cosmology, embodying the limitless potential and feminine aspect of divinity.

### IV. The Priestess's Role Evaluated
In the Gnostic Mass, the Priestess is responsible for the consecration, unveiling, and the interaction with divine energies. Her actions and presence signify a transformative force within the ritual. The formula of Tetragrammaton is symbolically enacted through the interaction between the different officers, more specifically between the Priest and Priestess.

The Priestess's role is of utmost importance in the ritual because she embodies the principle of Nuit, illuminating the process of creation and manifestation, both individually and collectively. When the first Heh of Tetragrammaton (the Priestess/Nuit) and Yod of Tetragrammaton (the Priest/Hadit) interact and unite, it sets in motion the events for the second Heh of Tetragrammaton, representing the creation of the material world, and individual transformation.

### V. Implications for Individual and Collective Transformation
The Priestess's role, therefore, encompasses the idea of feminine power and potential, catalyzing both individual and collective spiritual development. By exemplifying the creative and transformative force through her actions in the Gnostic Mass, she inspires the initiates and congregants to explore their own inner potential for self-discovery, growth, and manifestation.

Moreover, the enactment of the formula of Tetragrammaton as it pertains to the Priestess facilitates an understanding of the nature of divine creation and the dynamic interplay of cosmic forces. This understanding may foster a sense of unity and the interconnectedness of all things, serving as a strong foundation for collective transformation within the Thelemic community.

In conclusion, the Priestess's role in the Gnostic Mass is essential to understanding Thelemic cosmology and the formula of Tetragrammaton, as it represents the principle of Nuit and the feminine aspect of divinity. Her involvement in the ritual serves as a catalyst for individual and collective transformation, enabling those participating in the Gnostic Mass to explore their true potential and understand their place in the cosmic scheme. By enacting the process of creation and manifestation, the Priestess helps initiates and congregants develop a deeper spiritual realization and fosters a sense of unity, all of which contribute to the growth and progress of the Thelemic community.
