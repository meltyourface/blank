1. Key philosophical differences and commonalities

The most critical philosophical differences between the Mahayana sutras and the Theravada Pali canon are their interpretations of emptiness (śūnyatā), non-self (anattā), and the nature of reality. While both traditions are rooted in the concept of anattā, Mahayana Buddhism builds upon this foundation with the doctrine of śūnyatā, which posits that all phenomena are inherently empty of any lasting, independent essence. This concept is absent in the Theravada tradition; instead, it focuses on the practical application of understanding the three marks of existence (anicca, dukkha, anattā) to achieve liberation.

Both traditions share a common goal of reaching enlightenment; however, Mahayana places a greater emphasis on compassion and altruism, while Theravada emphasizes personal liberation through individual effort.

2. Variations in the portrayal of the Buddha

In the Theravada tradition, the Buddha is primarily portrayed as a historical figure and a supreme teacher who achieved enlightenment through his own efforts. The emphasis is on his teachings and the path he followed to reach enlightenment. On the other hand, Mahayana Buddhism encompasses diverse perspectives on the Buddha. It not only venerates the historical Buddha but also introduces the concept of multiple celestial Buddhas, perhaps the most significant being Amitabha, and transcendent bodhisattvas that aid beings on the path to enlightenment. The Buddha's role is more cosmic and universal in the Mahayana tradition compared to his presentation as a human example in Theravada.

3. Bodhisattva figures specific to Mahayana Buddhism

The significance of bodhisattva figures in Mahayana Buddhism is largely absent from the Theravada Pali canon. Bodhisattvas are beings who have attained a high level of spiritual realization and actively work towards the liberation of all sentient beings. In Mahayana, the bodhisattva path is praised as the highest goal, and adherents strive to embody the bodhisattva qualities to attain full Buddhahood for the benefit of all.

4. Impact on meditation practices and ethical guidelines

In Theravada practice, the Noble Eightfold Path provides a framework for ethical conduct, mental development, and wisdom. Mahayana Buddhism incorporates but extends these practices by introducing the concept of the six perfections (pāramitā) that serve as an elaboration of the Noble Eightfold Path and explicitly emphasize the altruistic motivation to benefit others.

These six perfections encompass generosity, moral discipline, patience, energetic effort, concentration, and wisdom. Practicing the six perfections within Mahayana meditation not only develops personal wisdom but also cultivates compassion and altruistic motivation.

5. Development of Mahayana and Theravada branches

The Mahayana and Theravada branches of Buddhism have distinct historical, geographical, and cultural contexts. Theravada Buddhism primarily evolved in South Asia, following the Pali canon and preserving the early teachings of the Buddha. In contrast, Mahayana Buddhism developed in Central and East Asia and was influenced by diverse philosophical and cultural traditions.

The Mahayana sutras significantly influenced the geographic expansion and cultural distinctions within Mahayana Buddhism. These texts allowed for greater adaptability, enabling Mahayana to embrace diverse cultural practices and reach a broad range of people. Meanwhile, the Pali canon's role in providing a foundation for Theravada continues to shape its more conservative, text-based approach that is rooted in the historical context of the early Buddhist teachings.
