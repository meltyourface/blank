Welcome, seeker of the mysteries. I invite you to prepare for an immersive guided visualization that will take you on a deep exploration of the mystical realm within the Book of the Law, focusing on the Qabalistic journey through the Tree of Life. As we traverse each of the ten Sefiroth and the twenty-two paths that connect them, you will experience intricate symbolism, signposts, and insights related to the Thoth Tarot and the 93 Current. Remember to breathe deeply, relax your mind, and open your heart to the infinite wisdom within you.

We begin in the world of Assiah, representing the four elements and physical existence. You stand before the Tree of Life comprised of ten glowing spheres interconnected by twenty-two gleaming paths. The first sphere, or the Crown, Malkuth, shines brilliantly under your feet, anchoring you to the Earth.

Visualize yourself drawing in the energies of Malkuth, the sphere of Earth. Its colors are citrine, olive, russet, and black. Envision yourself firmly planted, connected to the divine name Adonai ha-Aretz, and the archangel Sandalphon.

Now, ascend the path of Tau (32nd path) connecting Malkput with the ninth Sefirah, Yesod, using the guidance of The World tarot card, allowing the Zodiac to unfold before you. Connect to Yesod, the sphere of the Moon. Its color is violet, resonating with the divine name Shaddai El Chai, and the archangel Gabriel. Visualize yourself balancing your emotions and connecting with the lunar tides.

As your journey progresses, climb the path of Shin (31st path) relating to the Judgement card. Reach Hod, the eighth sphere, representing Mercury. Images of intellect and communication manifest as your vibration aligns with the divine name Elohim Tzabaoth. The colors are orange and the overseeing archangel is Michael.

Now, ascend to Netzach (7th Sefirah) from Yesod, traverse path of Resh (30th path), using The Sun tarot card. Embrace the loving rays of solar energy, and vibrate with the divine name YHVH Tzabaoth. Color is emerald green, and the archangel Haniel watches over.

We now travel from Hod to Netzach along the path of Qoph (29th path) associated with the Moon tarot card and the element of Water. Connect with the emotions of Netzach and the brilliance of Hod.

Next, rise to Tiphereth, at the center of the tree, via path of Tsaddi (28th path) resonating with The Star card and the sign of Aquarius. The sixth Sefirah represents the Sun, perfect balance, and divine consciousness. Its color is radiant yellow, and its guardian is the archangel Raphael. Vibrate with YHVH Eloah V'Da'ath.

Having tasted unity, move to Geburah (Mars) via path of Peh (27th path) embodying the vibrations of the Tower card, embracing images of destruction and rebirth. Geburahâ€™s color is red, invigorating you with the power and strength of the divine name Elohim Gibor and the protection of archangel Khamael.

Capitalize on the balance of Chesed (Jupiter) on path of Ayin (26th path), The Devil card. Visualize deep blue color and Mercury's winged feet, and connect with the divine name El and the archangel Tzadkiel.

Continue to the higher realms from Tiphereth, following path of Samekh (25th path) and Temperance card, arriving at Da'ath - the hidden Sefirah. Open yourself to infinite wisdom, acceptance, and understanding.

Ascend to Binah (3rd Sefirah), traveling path of Mem (23rd path), relating to the Hanged Man and element of Water. Let the deep indigo color and the divine name YHVH Elohim permeate your being, and receive the blessings of archangel Tzaphkiel.

Glide through path of Lamed (22nd path) connected with the Adjustment card, and arrive at Chokmah (2nd Sefirah), the sphere of original wisdom, governed by Uranus. Its color is grey, and the divine name YHVH allows revelations to unfold with archangel Raziel's guidance.

Finally, via path of Aleph (11th path) and the Fool's plunge into the unknown, emerge in Kether (1st Sefirah), the Crown, where all begins and ends. White brilliance shows the divine unity, guided by archangel Metatron and the divine name Eheieh.

Having reached the pinnacle, acknowledge divine oneness and the wisdom you carry within your soul. Slowly, bring your awareness back to the physical world, allowing the transformative journey through the Tree of Life to leave a lasting positive impact on your spiritual awakening.
