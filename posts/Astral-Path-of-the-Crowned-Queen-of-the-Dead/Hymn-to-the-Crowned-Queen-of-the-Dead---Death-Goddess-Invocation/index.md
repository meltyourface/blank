description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Astral Path of the Crowned Queen of the Dead, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose an intricate hymn or verse venerating the Crowned Queen of the Dead specifically for use within the advanced rites of the Astral Path, embodying her enigmatic attributes, and incorporating expressive language befitting her dominion over the life and death cycle. Ensure the composition includes invocations that resonate with the otherworldly energies of the Queen and incorporate strategically placed pauses for ritualistic offerings or silent contemplation during both ceremonial work and private devotions. Additionally, integrate symbolic imagery and arcane symbolism, subtly interwoven throughout the verse, to forge a deeper connection with the Queen and the Astral Path for those who perform the hymn.

## Hymn to the Crowned Queen of the Dead

(Verse 1)
From the waning moon's descent, 'neath the twilight sky,
Where shadows veil the weary world, and mortal mirth abides,
Awakens now the astral path, that bridges life and death,
To seek the wisdom of the crown, a whispered Queen's behest.

(Chorus)
Hail, O Crowned Queen of the Dead, resplendent in decay,
You who stand upon the threshold, at the close of every day.
In strength we rise, in hope we kneel to breathe thy sacred name,
Bound in veneration's chains, eternally proclaimed.

(Verse 2)
Where the roots of Yggdrasil, meet the sky of Nyx,
Her throne omnipotent, a sovereign's seat enthroned,
All-seeing eyes pierce inner realms, awaken dormant dreams,
As serpents coil their chthonic tether, infernal wisdom glean.

(Chorus)
Hail, O Crowned Queen of the Dead, resplendent in decay,
You who stand upon the threshold, at the close of every day.
In strength we rise, in hope we kneel to breathe thy sacred name,
Bound in veneration's chains, eternally proclaimed.

(Bridge: Offerings and Silent Contemplation)
[Silence marked by obsidian tears, as offerings anoint the altar high,
Ephemeral whispers echo, as we part the voids to call the Queen nigh.]

(Verse 3)
Veil of eternal night now lifts, as astral roadways rise,
Revealing now the Queen's domain, that lies beyond our grasp.
Through trials of the seraphic blaze, and the depths of hel's own embrace,
With iron will and devotion we tread, to kneel at the Queen's alabaster gate.

(Chorus)
Hail, O Crowned Queen of the Dead, resplendent in decay,
You who stand upon the threshold, at the close of every day.
In strength we rise, in hope we kneel to breathe thy sacred name,
Bound in veneration's chains, eternally proclaimed.

(Coda: Invocation)
By the essence of nightshade's kiss, and the cold wind's wailing cry,
We beseech thee, Crowned Queen of the Dead, to heed our pleading, nigh.
Enshrouded Valkyrie, from 'yond the pale, ascend to majesty,
Rise, ascend, entwined in power, awakened fearlessly.

[Ending: Silence for ceremonial work or private devotions]
