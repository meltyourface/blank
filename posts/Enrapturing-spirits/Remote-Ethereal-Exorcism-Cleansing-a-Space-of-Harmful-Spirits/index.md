To perform a remote ethereal exorcism of ensnaring spirits, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the sacred space: 
Find a quiet and undisturbed area where you can focus your energy and intent on the task at hand. Light a white candle and burn incense such as frankincense to cleanse the atmosphere.

2. Establish a connection with the targeted space:
Close your eyes and take several deep breaths, grounding yourself in the present moment. Envision the location you wish to perform the exorcism on, and feel your energy tethering to the space, creating an unbreakable bond.

3. Create a protective barrier:
Visualize a radiant and impenetrable sphere of white light encircling both you and the affected space. This barrier will shield you from any harmful energies or entities encountered during the exorcism.

4. Employ intricate sigils for expulsion:
Draw upon the power of sacred symbols and sigils to banish unwanted energies and entities. Visualize complex sigils, such as the hexagram, enveloping the space and working in unison to cleanse and purify it.

5. Invoke higher astral beings:
Recite precise incantations to call upon powerful astral beings, such as archangels Michael and Raphael, to assist you in the removal and banishment of ensnaring spirits. An example incantation could be: "I invoke the divine powers of the Archangels Michael and Raphael. Aid me in this sacred task, protect this space, and repel any spirits that seek to cause harm or imbalance."

6. Perform the exorcism:
With the support of the higher astral beings, visualize the ensnaring spirits being detached from the space and bound in radiant chains of light. Speak the commands with confidence and authority: "Ensnaring spirits, I command you to leave this space. By the power of the higher beings, I banish you from this realm and sever all ties you have to this place."

7. Fortify the vibrational frequency of the space:
Once the spirits have been removed, perform a cleansing ritual to restore balance and reinforce the energy of the space. Visualize a shimmering pillar of golden light descending upon the location, filling it with warmth, positivity, and the highest vibrations.

8. Seal the space with protective talismans:
Employ talismans charged with protective energy, such as crystals or amulets, to help maintain the space's frequency and keep it guarded against future ensnaring spirits.

9. Disconnect and give thanks:
Thank the higher astral beings for their assistance and release their energy from the space. Untether your connection to the location and envision your protective sphere dissolving. Finally, extinguish the white candle and give gratitude for the successful completion of the remote ethereal exorcism.

Remember, performing such a task requires a deep understanding of the esoteric arts and unwavering focus. It is crucial to remain vigilant and confident throughout the process to best navigate any challenges that may arise.
