To answer this intricate knowledge challenge, we must first delve into the significance of the Palazzo Medici, followed by an exploration of the Medici family's esoteric and astrological inclinations. Then, we shall examine the connection between these inclinations and the architectural features of the Palazzo. Lastly, we will evaluate its impact on the spiritual climate of the Renaissance era and draw conclusions on the lessons that a seeker of hidden knowledge might extrapolate from this divine synthesis.

The Palazzo Medici, also known as the Medici-Riccardi Palace, stands as a monument to the power, prestige, and influence of the Medici family in Florence during the Renaissance. As the dominant political force during this period, the Medici endeavored to showcase their wealth and bolster their reputation through patronage of the arts, philosophy, science, and architecture. The Palazzo's design, commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici, and realized by the architect Michelozzo, was intended to evoke a sense of grandeur and classical beauty, reflective of the family's deeply ingrained affinity for humanism and the esoteric thought that permeated Renaissance thought.

One needs to look no further than the exquisite architectural design and decoration of the Palazzo Medici to observe the intricate correlation between the family's esoteric beliefs and astrological inclinations. The family had a close connection with the famed philosopher and theologian, Marsilio Ficino, who was influential in translating the works of Plato, Hermes Trismegistus, and other vital texts of the Hermetic tradition, which contributed to the synthesis of various mystical systems of thought known as the prisca theologia, a doctrine that purports to establish an ancient, unifying, and divine wisdom at the root of all religions. 

Astrology, as a vital aspect of the esoteric tradition, was highly regarded within the Medici household. The relevance of astrology to the Palazzo Medici is evident in the frescoes found within its walls. For instance, the famed Magi Chapel, with its famous frescoes by Benozzo Gozzoli, features not only the Medici family members as the Magi but also a multitude of astrological symbols and celestial bodies. These artistic compositions are testimonies to the family's interest in deciphering the celestial patterns and their potential influence on human destiny. The family's astrological ambitions are further evident in the fresco of the Procession of the Magi, which showcases the zodiacal signs subtly integrated into the scene, pointing to the heavenly mysteries that informed the Medici's political and spiritual pursuits.

In addition to these artistic representations, the architectural features of the Palazzo further reflect the Medici's predilection toward the esoteric and astrological. The Palazzo's overall design embodies geometry and proportionality, inspired by the classical orders of architecture, which are inherently connected to the sacred principles of the cosmos. The extensive use of Roman arches and Corinthian columns in conjunction with mathematical harmony and balance seeks to create a microcosm, a reflection of the universe's order within the Palazzo's walls. This architectural expression of cosmic symbolism not only manifests the family's philosophical and mystical pursuits but also aligns the Palazzo with the divine in an attempt to encapsulate the celestial influences in the terrestrial realm.

The intermingling of the esoteric, astrological, and architectural aspects of the Palazzo Medici encapsulates the zeitgeist of the Renaissance's spiritual climate, typified by the blending of various intellectual, artistic, and mystical currents. This complex synthesis exemplified by the Medici family endeavors to perpetuate the idea that the comprehension of celestial wisdom can be achieved by harnessing the mysteries of the cosmos at the nexus between human knowledge and divine providence. 

In conclusion, a seeker of hidden knowledge can draw multiple insights from the divine synthesis found within the Palazzo Medici. Firstly, the synthesis emphasizes the vital role of beauty, geometry, and cosmic symbolism in revealing the universal truths inherent in the human condition and the esoteric beliefs that underpin them. Secondly, it serves as a testimony to the import of interdisciplinary study in promoting a deep and comprehensive understanding of the world. Lastly, the Palazzo Medici stands as a shining beacon illuminating the power of art, architecture, and intellectual pursuits in manifesting the divine wisdom that transcends space and time, inspiring future generations to push the envelopes of human imagination and understanding, and uncover the hidden meanings of our cosmic existence.
