The architectural evolution between Baroque and Renaissance Italian Palazzos highlights a significant shift in aesthetic values, design principles, and socio-political contexts that shaped the artistic landscape in Italy. These two distinct periods played a crucial role in the development of European art and architecture and were deeply influenced by their cultural, historical, and geographical contexts.

Renaissance Palazzos (15th-16th centuries) were characterized by a revival of classical Roman architectural principles and a renewed interest in humanism. These principles were reflected in the harmony, symmetry, and proportionality of the designs, as seen in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, which was largely designed by renowned architects Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Michelangelo.

Key elements that distinguished Renaissance Palazzos include:
1. Simple, geometrical facades with minimal ornamentation 
2. **Use of classical columns and pilasters to support the structure **
3. Prominence of arches, particularly in the entrance portals 
4. **A layout that emphasized a central courtyard surrounded by a loggia **
5. Use of frescoes, sculptures, and other forms of artistic embellishment to accentuate the grandeur of the interiors

Baroque Palazzos (late 16th-18th centuries) evolved as a reaction to the austerity of Renaissance architecture and embraced a more dynamic, grand, and complex aesthetic, influenced by the Counter-Reformation and the desire of the Catholic Church to impress and awe its followers. The Palazzo Carignano in Turin, designed by Guarino Guarini, is an excellent example of Baroque architecture.

Key features distinguishing Baroque Palazzos include:
1. **Curving and undulating facades that created a sense of movement and energy**
2. Richly detailed ornamentation, including statues, friezes, and stucco work
3. Complex spatial arrangements that played with the viewer's perception 
4. A more theatrical approach to the exteriors, often incorporating theatrical illusions and trompe l'oeil techniques in the design 
5. Use of grand staircases, domes, and large-scale frescoes to heighten the sense of drama and grandiosity

The cultural, historical, and geographical factors that contributed to these shifts in Italian architecture primarily revolved around the changing political and religious dynamics. The Renaissance was dominated by wealthy merchant families like the Medicis, who funded artistic projects that reflected their humanist values and interests in rediscovering classical antiquity. This period also marks the rise of the centralized Italian city-states, which sought to project their wealth and power through grand architectural statements.

The Baroque era coincided with the Counter-Reformation when the Catholic Church sought to reassert its authority and influence through grand artistic displays. Additionally, the emergence of powerful monarchies such as the Habsburgs, Borghese, and Savoy further heightened the desire for extravagance and splendor in art and architecture. Consequently, the Baroque style catered to these requirements with its focus on grandiosity, drama, and spectacle, especially in states governed by strong Catholic monarchies.

In conclusion, the architectural evolution between Baroque and Renaissance Italian Palazzos reveals a complex interplay of artistic styles, socio-political developments, and architectural innovation. The Palazzo Farnese and Palazzo Carignano serve as exemplary illustrations of these eras, showcasing a clear shift in aesthetics, design principles, and the overarching vision that drove these transformative periods in European art and architecture.
