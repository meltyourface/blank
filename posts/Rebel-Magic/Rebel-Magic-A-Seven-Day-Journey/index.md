excerpt: Design a comprehensive seven-day curriculum tailored for practitioners of Rebel Magic, focused on unshackling one's mind from the constraints of traditional and dogmatic magical systems. Each day should introduce a unique theme and associated exercises to help in the exploration and mastery of alternative, nonconformist magical practices. The curriculum should include innovative rituals, mind-expanding meditations, and stimulating discussions around the history and principles of Rebel Magic, as well as practical applications in daily life. Within each day's agenda, highlight opportunities for the practitioner to identify their personal limitations, transcend boundaries, and develop their own eclectic and powerful magical style.
