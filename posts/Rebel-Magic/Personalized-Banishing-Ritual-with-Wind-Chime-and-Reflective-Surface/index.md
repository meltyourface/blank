Task: Devise an innovative Rebel Magic banishing ritual that refrains from invoking any deities and avoids employing conventional magical implements such as athames, wands, or incense. Incorporate unconventional materials and techniques.

Ritual Name: The Revoking Whirlwind

Underlying Magical Theory: The Revoking Whirlwind relies on the practitioner's ability to harness and focus their own personal power and intent, rather than invoking external deities or energies. The ritual draws upon natural elements and everyday items, aiming to create a personalized approach to banishing negative energies and entities.

Materials:

1. A small handheld mirror or reflective surface
2. A glass jar with a sealing lid
3. Salt
4. Three pieces of dried fruit or three small stones of personal significance
5. A small piece of paper and a pen
6. A wind chime (preferably with metallic tubes)

Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. Choose a suitable location for the ritual â€“ preferably an open space, free from distractions and with a gentle breeze to allow the wind chime to sound.

2. Within this space, create a triangle on the ground by placing one piece of dried fruit or stone at each corner. Position the wind chime in the center of this triangle.

3. Stand outside of the triangle facing the wind chime and, with the pen and paper, write down the specific negative energy or entity you seek to banish.

4. Take a handful of salt and sprinkle it around the three corners of the triangle, following the lines formed by the dried fruit or stones. As you do this, silently declare that the triangle, and the space within it, is a sacred sanctuary dedicated to purifying and dispelling negativity.

5. **Hold the mirror to reflect the wind chime, and, with unwavering intent and concentration, recite the following incantation**:

  "I, a master of my own power,
   Reflect and revoke the darkness of this hour.
   Let this chime be the force of banishment,
   Releasing negativity with each resounding descent."

6. Place the written paper beneath the wind chime, allowing the breeze to activate the chime and amplify the intent of the ritual.

7. As the chime sounds, envision the negative energies or entities dispersing like dust in the wind, leaving only purified energy behind.

8. After a few minutes, or when you feel the ritual to be complete, gather the paper from beneath the wind chime and place it inside the glass jar, sealing it tightly.

9. Bury the jar outside of your sacred space, signifying the entrapment of negativity and cutting all ties with it.

Desired Outcome: Execution of the Revoking Whirlwind ritual effectively expels any lingering negative energies or entities, leaving the practitioner and their environment cleared and revitalized. The use of personalized elements such as dried fruit or stones and a wind chime personalizes the ritual and increases its potency, allowing the practitioner to embrace the power of their intent and focus.
