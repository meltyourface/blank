The chosen Occult tradition for this response is the Hermetic Tradition. To fully understand and appreciate the intricacies of this tradition, it is necessary to delve into its historical influences and syncretism, its interconnections to contemporary counterparts, and its unique way of conveying profound truths.

Historical Influences and Syncretism:

The Hermetic Tradition has its roots in the Hellenistic period of Egyptian and Greek syncretism (circa 4th to the 1st century BC) inspired by the mythological Hermes Trismegistus, a fusion of the Greek Hermes and the Egyptian Thoth. This figure symbolizes the combination of their respective knowledge in writing, magic, and philosophy.

The foundational texts in the Hermetic Tradition are the Corpus Hermeticum, a collection of treatises ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus that encompasses subjects such as astrology, alchemy, and theology. Additionally, there are the Emerald Tablets, which are said to contain the secrets of alchemy, theurgy, and the manifestation of divine wisdom.

The Hermetic Tradition has undergone several phases of syncretism throughout history. It assimilated influences from Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Christianity during the early CE periods and later, incorporating Arabic, Jewish, and Renaissance elements to form the basis of esoteric philosophical and magical systems like the Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, and Freemasonry.

Interconnections with Contemporary Counterparts:

While the Hermetic Tradition can be seen as an esoteric system in its own right, its teachings, values, and methodologies have influenced numerous mystical and magical traditions today.

For example, modern ceremonial magic, including the practices of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Thelema, has drawn heavily upon the Hermetic Tradition's emphasis on symbolism, ritual, and the principle of "as above, so below," the idea that cosmic order and events mirror those of the earthly plane and vice versa. 

New Age spiritual practices also adopt Hermetic concepts, such as the Laws of Attraction and Vibration, as well as integrating the ideas of spiritual alchemy - the transformation and evolution of the human soul.

Unique Way of Conveying Profound Truths:

A key feature of the Hermetic Tradition lies in its multilayered approach to conveying esoteric knowledge and wisdom. Through allegory, symbolism, and myth, it encourages the seeker to plumb the depths of their inner self, recognize the unity and interconnectedness of all things, and invoke the divine qualities within to achieve spiritual enlightenment.

One of the most well-known texts that convey Hermetic truths is The Emerald Tablet, which encapsulates the essence of Hermetic philosophy through its cryptic phrases. The most famous phrase, "As above, so below," suggests a fundamental, metaphysical truth about the nature of reality: that the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the universe) are reflections of one another. 

To summarize, the Hermetic Tradition emerged from a historically rich and syncretic background that combined Greco-Egyptian philosophy, Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, alchemy, astrology, and various spiritual influences throughout the centuries. Its impact on modern esotericism is vast, shaping many contemporary magical and mystical practices. The unique approach employed by the Hermetic Tradition to convey profound truths emphasizes a journey of self-discovery, connecting the inner with the greater cosmic reality, and ultimately realizing the divine potential within.
