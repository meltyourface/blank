Mantra: "Exodium Recludas Lux Kyanite Ekaheira Seraphis"

Instructions for Preparation and Recitation:

1. Choose a quiet, clean, and sacred space where you feel secure and comfortable. This will be the area to perform the mantra. An altar is recommended for added focus and intensity.

2. Prepare the ancient symbols. **Draw or place the following symbols around the altar or your chosen space**:

- The Eye of Horus (associated with protection and cosmic wisdom)
- The Pentacle (symbolizing the five elements - fire, water, air, earth, and spirit)
- The Helm of Awe (an emblem of spiritual defense)

3. Ensure your mental and physical state is calm and relaxed. Perform grounding exercises, such as slow breathing, meditation, or any practice suitable to your beliefs.

4. Light three white candles and place them on the altar or around your sacred space. These candles represent divine clarity and protection from negativity.

5. Begin the mantra recitation by holding your preferred hand over your heart, symbolizing the connection to your inner strength and resolve. Close your eyes as you focus on the intent to banish malevolent energies or attract positive cosmic forces.

6. Recite the mantra "Exodium Recludas Lux Kyanite Ekaheira Seraphis" exactly as it is, nine times in succession. Your voice should be firm, clear, and unwavering.

7. Allow the vibrations of the mantra to deeply resonate within you, visualizing both the words and the ancient symbols as part of a brilliant, radiant light. Embrace the light, and let it wash over you, filling you with the potent energy of Reclaimed retribution.

8. Bask in the powerful energy for a few moments, then slowly return to your normal awareness. Thank the cosmic forces, and extinguish the candles.
