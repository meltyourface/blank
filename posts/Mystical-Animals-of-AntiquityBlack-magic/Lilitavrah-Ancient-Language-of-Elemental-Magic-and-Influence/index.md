excerpt: Invent a detailed and enigmatic symbolic language exclusive to the realm of black magic for establishing an intricate communication with an ancient mystical creature, specifically a demonic entity known as the Lilitu. Devise an extensive alphabetical system, grammar rules, and conjuring rituals, incorporating elements such as alchemical symbols, runes, and astrological signs. Additionally, conceptualize a visually-arresting method of inscribing this language onto a grimoire, and provide a sample of encoded messages and incantations to summon, communicate, and command the Lilitu using this newly crafted arcane language.

Grammar Rules:

3. Nouns have a singular, dual, and plural form.
4. Verbs are conjugated based on tense, aspect, and mood.
5. No articles or gender distinctions.

Conjuring Rituals:
1. Create a ritual circle using salt infused with crushed, dried nightshade.
2. At each cardinal point, inscribe the corresponding elemental symbol in the circle.
3. Light black candles corresponding to the number of symbols in the desired message or incantation.
4. Engrave the message or incantation in Lilitavrah onto a parchment using a quill dipped in ink infused with powdered onyx.
5. Place the parchment in the center of the circle.
6. Invoke the astrological signs by drawing them in the air above the parchment while reciting their names in Lilitavrah.
7. Recite the message or incantation aloud in Lilitavrah while focusing intent on commanding the Lilitu.

Inscribing Method:
Using a stylus or bone-carving tool, carefully etch the Lilitavrah symbols and text into the grimoire's pages in an intricate swirling pattern emulating the Lilitu's serpentine form. Fill any empty space with esoteric symbols and glyphs to amplify the power of the language and reinforce the connection to the Lilitu.

Sample Encoded Message:
Summoning: (XZO ITW YMZA) - "Pluto-Separation-Journey Mercury-Power-Transformation Fire-Air-Sulphur"

**Commanding**: (UJO IGW XOQ) - "Jupiter-Connection-Balance Mars-Energy-Earth Saturn-Uranus-Connection"
