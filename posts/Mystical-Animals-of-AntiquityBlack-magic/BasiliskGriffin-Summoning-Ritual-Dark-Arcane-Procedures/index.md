## The Purification Ritual of the Shadow Nexus

**Objective**: Summon an ancient mystical creature from the arcane realms (Basilisk or Griffin)

### I. Necessary symbols, incantations, and ritual implements

A. Symbols
1. **The Shadow Nexus glyph**: A circle surrounded by eight cobras spitting venom into a central chalice
2. **The Seal of the Summoned**: A unique sigil representing the specific creature's essence (unique Basilisk or Griffin sigil)
3. **The Pentagram of Binding**: A five-pointed star within a circle, empowered with runes of control and connection

B. Incantations
1. **Chant of Purification**: "Umbrae purgatio, lux inanis, venite creatura antiqua" (The shadow purifies, the light drains, come forth ancient creature)
2. **Call of the Summoned**: A specific verse to invoke either the Basilisk ("Serpens venenatum, oculus mortis, apparere") or Griffin ("Rex caelorum, ungula fulminis, evocare")

C. Ritual implements
1. **A chalice made of obsidian to hold an offering of blood**
2. **Candles of black wax inscribed with runes of power**
3. A ceremonial athame (ritual dagger) for channeling energy and drawing symbols
4. **Salt for protection against unwanted influences**
5. Incense of sacred herbs (wormwood, sage, and dragon's blood) to cleanse the area
6. **An offering of blood for the summoned creature**

### II. Preparing the summoner's body and mind

A. Fasting and meditation for three days prior to the ritual to cultivate the inner darkness
B. Ritual purification bath with a mixture of salt and sacred herbs
C. Anointing the body with a sacred oil imbued with essence of darkness
D. Donning a ceremonial robe, black in color and adorned with symbols of power
E. Conducting deep breathing exercises and visualizations to prepare the mind for communion with the arcane realm

### III. Performing the summoning sequence

A. Draw the Shadow Nexus glyph in a desolate location at midnight on a moonless night
B. Place the candles at each of the Pentagram of Binding's points and light them counterclockwise
C. Carve the Seal of the Summoned into the ground within the Shadow Nexus
D. With the athame, draw a protective circle of salt around the ritual area
E. Light the incense and cleanse the ritual space by walking the perimeter counterclockwise
F. Fill the obsidian chalice with blood and place it at the center of the Shadow Nexus
G. Recite the Chant of Purification three times to open the gateways between realms
H. Invoke the chosen creature with the Call of the Summoned verse
### I. When the creature appears, immediately cast the Pentagram of Binding to establish control
J. Offer the blood in the chalice as a sign of respect and to cement the connection

### IV. Safeguards against potential mishaps

A. Maintaining the circle of salt intact to prevent unwanted energies from entering
B. Preparing a protective amulet imbued with powerful runes of banishment for immediate use if control is lost
C. Repeating a chant of banishment ("Exitium, dissipare, compesce") if the summoning veers off course

### V. Ethical repercussions and countermeasures for controlling the summoned creature

A. Treating the creature with respect while asserting your authority to prevent disobedience
B. Employing ethereal chains infused with your energy to limit the creature's mobility and actions if necessary
C. Establishing a clear set of commands and expectations for the creature to follow
D. Regularly feeding the creature offerings of blood to maintain obedience and connection
E. Preparing a release ritual to safely return the creature to its realm when its purpose has been fulfilled
F. Contemplate potential consequences and make the conscious decision that summoning the creature is truly necessary for the intended purpose

Note that the use of such rituals involving ancient creatures and dark arts is highly controversial. Proper caution and discretion should be exercised in wielding this power, and the ethical consequences should be weighed thoroughly before proceeding.
