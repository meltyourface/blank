The impact of diverse environmental and geographical factors on the emergence, evolution, and dissemination of esoteric and occult practices can be examined through the lens of human history by categorizing these influences within the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods of the Three Ages of Mankind. This analysis will construct a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between climate, terrain, resource availability, and the development of specific mystical traditions, rituals, and symbols throughout these ages.

During the Paleolithic period, hunter-gatherers comprised the majority of human society. Due to the Ice Age's harsh climate and the need to constantly search for food, humanity's relationship with nature became an integral aspect of early spiritual beliefs, giving rise to shamanic practices. Shamans were seen as intermediaries between the physical world and the spirit world, capable of healing and obtaining guidance from animal spirits, who were thought to symbolically represent the resource abundance necessary for the group's survival. Cave paintings such as those in Lascaux, France, provide evidence of these beliefs, depicting scenes of hunting and animals believed to have spiritual significance.

In the Mesolithic period, as the Ice Age receded and global climate patterns shifted, human societies began to settle in a wider range of environments, from coastal regions to dense forests. This diversification of settlement location led to the proliferation of unique esoteric practices tailored to each region's specific geographic and environmental factors. Astral reverence emerged during this time, in which worship of celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars were engrained in the rituals and symbolism of Mesolithic societies. Stone formations such as the megalithic structures of the Carnac stones in Brittany exemplify this astral reverence. The celestial bodies' predictable movements became associated with the cycle of seasons, life and death, and the passage of time, thus forming the backbone of several esoteric practices.

By the Neolithic period, the development of agriculture allowed humans to establish more permanent settlements. As communities became more sedentary, the significance of fertility rites and rituals centered around the annual planting and harvesting seasons emerged. Environmental factors such as the availability of fertile soil, water, and sunlight influenced the development of these belief systems. A notable example of this evolving spiritual focus can be seen in GÃ¶bekli Tepe, Turkey, a site known for its megalithic structures adorned with carved animals and geometric shapes, many of which are believed to symbolize fertility and abundance. Additionally, the construction of monuments and sacred spaces to influence or appeal to the deities responsible for the health and fertility of crops and livestock can be seen in sites like Stonehenge in England, suggesting a strong spiritual connection to the environment.

Considering these case studies together, the nexus between geography, environment, and occult practices in the Three Ages of Mankind becomes clear. The specific climate, terrain, and resource availability for each society shaped the emergence, evolution, and dissemination of esoteric and occult practices in distinct ways. The combined examination of the shamanic practices in the Paleolithic, astral reverence in the Mesolithic, and fertility rites in the Neolithic periods encapsulates the profound influence of environmental factors on both the development and expression of occult practices throughout human history.
