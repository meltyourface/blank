  Title: The Rite of Entropic Rebirth
  
  Stage 1: The Decay of the Old
  
  1. **Preparation**: The ceremony begins at the dusk of a new moon. The participants wear black mourning garments and adorn themselves with symbols of decay like skulls, withering flowers, and tattered cloth. The ritual space is prepared within a grove of dying trees, where an earthen altar is set. Upon the altar, place a single rose with wilted petals, a human skull as a symbol of mortality, and a vessel filled with dark, murky water. The air is heavy with the scent of decay and Eucalyptus leaves.
  
  2. **Chant of Dissolution**: Participants gather around the altar, forming a circle. They begin to chant an ominous incantation, invoking the forces of Decay. With the ancient words, they beseech the energies of the dark realm to break down the walls between life and death, sinking weaker elements into the depths of decay.
  
  3. **Sacrifice of the Old**: Each participant holds a small token representing a facet of their life they wish to leave behind, allowing it to decay. These tokens are cast into the vessel of murky water, which, absorbing the energy of those aspects, becomes a potent symbol of decay. The chanting intensifies as the process of relinquishing the past begins.
  
  Stage 2: The Liminal Phase
  
  1. **The Veil**: With the completion of the Sacrifice of the Old, the ritual transitions into the Liminal Phase. A gossamer veil of black cloth is draped over the altar, symbolizing the thin barrier between life and death. The participants continue their chant, but it now transforms into a hum, a mournful dirge of loss and longing.
  
  2. **The Seance**: Remaining seated in a circle, the participants focus their energy on the entropic force, communing with the spirits and energies entwined with Decay. They seek guidance from these spectral entities, who will guide them through the transformational process of the rite.
  
  3. **The Contemplation**: As the seance ends, participants fall into a deep state of contemplation. In this liminal state, they draw upon the knowledge gleaned from the spirits and their communion with the entropic force, taking time to understand the gravity of their own funeral ceremonies to decay the old and yield to the new.
  
  Stage 3: The Rebirth of the New
  
  1. **The Dawning**: As the midnight hour arrives, participants begin to emerge from their contemplative state. The veil is lifted from the altar, signifying the passage from death back to life. The dying rose is replaced with a newly budding one, a symbol of rejuvenated existence taking root within the domain of Decay.
  
  2. **Resurrection Chant**: The participants join hands and begin a new chant, one that extols the virtues of rebirth, metamorphosis, and the cyclical nature of life and death. The darkness around the ritual space begins to wane, and with its departure, the atmosphere of mourning dissipates.
  
  3. **Inversion**: Each participant retrieves their token from the vessel of murky water and witnesses its transformation, now marked by an energy that resonates growth and new beginnings. The ritual culminates in a collective release of the energies of rejuvenation and decay, enveloping the participants in tendrils of transformational force.
  
  Conclusion: The Rite of Entropic Rebirth closes with the dawning of a new day. Participants embrace the cyclical nature of life and death, understanding that Decay is not only an ending but also a powerful beginning. Life, death, and rebirth are intertwined, each reliant on the others for the energy that drives the cycle forward. The entropic release of withering growth and the sinister summoning of rejuvenated existence within the domain of Decay are honored, respected, and embraced as the eternal cycle that governs life.
