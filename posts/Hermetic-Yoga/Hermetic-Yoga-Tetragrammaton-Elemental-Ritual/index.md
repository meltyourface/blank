## Title: Tetragrammaton Hermetic Yoga Ritual

**Preparation**:
- Prepare the space by clearing it of any energies or objects that might distract from the practice. Cleanse the area with sage or frankincense, and create a sacred boundary around the space using salt or a white cord.
- Set up four altars or stations, one for each cardinal direction (North, East, South, and West). Each station will represent an aspect of the Tetragrammaton, an element, and a specific purpose within the ritual.
- The Eastern station represents the letter Yod (י) or YHVH, the element of air, and the faculties of the intellect. Decorate this station with feathers, incense, and yellow or gold-colored items.
- The Southern station represents the letter Heh (ה) or YHV(Y), the element of fire, and the vibrancy of life energy. Adorn this station with candles, fiery imagery, and red or orange-colored items.
- The Western station represents the letter Vav (ו) or - H, the element of water, and emotions and intuition. Decorate this station with seashells, cups of water, and blue or aqua-colored items.
- The Northern station represents the final letter Heh (ה) or V-, the element of earth, and the grounding of spiritual energy into the physical body. Adorn this station with stones, soil, and green or brown-colored items.
