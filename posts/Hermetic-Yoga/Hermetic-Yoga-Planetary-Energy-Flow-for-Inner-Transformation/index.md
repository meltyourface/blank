Surya Namaskar is a set of 12 dynamic asanas, performed in sequence, to invoke the energy of the sun. Begin by standing in Tadasana (Mountain pose) and recite the mantra while focusing on the fiery energy of the sun. Perform each asana in the sequence with measured breaths, inhaling and exhaling, feeling the energy of the sun flow through you.

Chandra Namaskar is a set of fluid, cooling asanas, performed under the moon's influence. Stand in Tadasana and recite the mantra, focusing on the soothing energy of the moon. Perform each asana in the sequence, inhaling and exhaling, allowing the moon's energy to replenish and nurture. Complete the sequence in Tadasana with hands in prayer position.
