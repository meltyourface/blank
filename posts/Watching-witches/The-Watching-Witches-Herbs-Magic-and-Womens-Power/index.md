The Watching witches, a secretive group of practitioners adept in the mastery of herbalism, medicine, and the occult, have long navigated the complex web of magical practice, cultural beliefs, and social dynamics. Their use of herbal and medicinal knowledge in crafting potent spells for both healing and hexing purposes is renowned, carving out an intricate relationship between these domains. This exploration delves into the specific herbs and rituals employed by Watching witches while shedding light on the wider cultural and societal implications of their practices.

Notable Herbs and their Roles:

1. **Belladonna (Atropa belladonna)**: Also known as Deadly Nightshade, Belladonna was employed by Watching witches in both medicine and their magical workings. Rich in the tropane alkaloids, it could ease pain when used in small doses, such as in ointments for joint pain or poultices for wounds. However, in larger doses, Belladonna was known to be used in curses and other malevolent spells due to its toxic and hallucinogenic properties.

2. **Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris)**: Widely used by the Watching witches, Mugwort straddled the realms of healing and divination. As an herbal medicine, Mugwort has been used to treat digestive issues and irregular menstruation. In magical rites, Mugwort was implemented in clairvoyance, lucid dreams, and astral projection.

3. **Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)**: A versatile herb, Yarrow plays various roles in the Watching witches' practices. Its use as a wound healing agent earned it the nickname "soldier's woundwort," while its astringent properties assisted both in reducing fevers and promoting love spells.

Cultural and Societal Implications:

The role of women as practitioners of herbalism, medicine, and witchcraft is an important aspect of Watching witches' history. Women often served as midwives, healers, and counselors. The considerable knowledge they possessed in these areas conferred a degree of power upon them, which was perceived as a threat by the male-dominated societies of the time. This perception contributed to the persecution of women who practiced medicine or were suspected of witchcraft.

One noteworthy example of persecution was the witch trials in Europe between the 15th and 18th centuries. Thousands of women accused of practicing witchcraft were executedâ€”most of them skilled in herbalism and midwifery, and some likely members of the Watching witches.

The Comprehensive Overview:

The Watching witches wove their expertise in herbalism and medicine into their magical practices, creating a complex interplay between domains. Their mutual understanding and use of specific herbs allowed them to craft powerful spells, which became a defining aspect of their work. Believing that balance must be forged between forces of light and dark, they wielded their knowledge for both healing and hexing purposes.

The societal landscape, particularly the role of women, exerted a profound impact on the Watching witches' practices. Many women were targeted as suspected witches due to their skills in herbalism and medicine, leading to persecution and the increased secrecy surrounding the Watching witches.

In conclusion, the Watching witches' mastery of herbalism, medicine, and occult practices is tightly interwoven with the wider context of historical witchcraft. Their survival and success as practitioners testify to the potency and adaptability of their knowledge. This unique group of witches offers invaluable insights into the intricate relationship between herbal practice, healing, magic, and the broader societal dynamics that have shaped perceptions of witchcraft throughout history.
