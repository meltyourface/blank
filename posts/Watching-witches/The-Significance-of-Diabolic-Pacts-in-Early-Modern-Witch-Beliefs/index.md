The diabolic pact, also known as a "deal with the devil," is a recurring theme within early modern Watching witch beliefs, stemming from Christian lore and the notion of sin. The diabolic pact holds a central role in the framework of these beliefs, as it represents the ultimate betrayal of religious faith and the pursuing of one's desires through malevolent means. This essay will investigate the significance of the diabolic pact in early modern Watching witch beliefs and delve into specific historical cases, while also examining the rituals, communication methods, and supernatural elements associated with these agreements.

One such historical case that exemplifies the prominence of the diabolic pact in witch trials is that of the accused Scottish witch, Isobel Gowdie, in 1662. Gowdie confessed to making a pact with the Devil, receiving supernatural powers and participating in various acts of malevolence against her fellow villagers. This case demonstrated how the diabolic pact was embedded in trial proceedings and played significant roles in the persecution of witches, often resulting in harsh punishments such as execution.

As far as rituals and communication methods surrounding the diabolic pact are concerned, it was commonly believed that a person wishing to make a pact would summon the Devil, either through incantations or by visiting a crossroad during specific lunar phases. Upon summoning, the person would renounce their Christian faith and swear allegiance to the Devil, often signing their name or making a mark in blood. In return, the Devil would bestow supernatural abilities and offer protection to the individual, enabling them to wreak havoc on their enemies or fulfill their desires.

Early modern Watching witches were typically associated with a supernatural familiar, such as an imp or animal, which served as a conduit for the diabolic powers granted through the pact. These familiars were responsible for carrying out the witches' malevolent acts and played a vital role in their occult practices. Additionally, the stories of diabolic pacts often alluded to the witches' engagement in nocturnal gatherings, known as sabbats, where they would engage in ritualistic practices, receive guidance from the Devil, and pay homage to demonic entities through various acts, such as dancing or kissing the Devil's behind, known as osculum infame.

The diabolic pact features prominently as a source of fascination and trepidation in early modern witchcraft beliefs due to underlying societal fears. Namely, the anxiety concerning religious devotion and the fear of losing one's salvation. These fears were further exacerbated by the duality of human nature and the potential for moral corruption, as well as the temptation that comes with the promise of power. The diabolic pact symbolized the danger of succumbing to one's selfish desires at the cost of their eternal soul, and hence, was a central component in religious and moral education of the time.

In conclusion, the diabolic pact held a significant position within the framework of early modern Watching witch beliefs, as it encapsulated numerous societal fears and anxieties surrounding religious devotion, moral corruption, and the allure of power. By examining historical cases, such as that of Isobel Gowdie, and the rituals, communication methods, and supernatural elements associated with diabolic pacts, we gain valuable insights into the darker aspects of human nature and the complex relationship that early modern societies had with the occult and the concept of evil.
