Answering this knowledge challenge requires an in-depth understanding of the esoteric, occult, and the Mysteries of Death's fell garden in relation to the cyclical nature of life, the transmutation of consciousness, and the journey of the soul. The key to this challenge lies in deciphering the symbolism of various plants, herbs, and flowers and their respective roots, leaves, and blossoms.

To begin with, the esoteric significance of a plant is typically associated with its various parts. Each plant in Death's fell garden, despite their ominous surroundings, possesses qualities relevant to the initiation into the Mysteries of Death.

1. Mandrake (Mandragora Officinarum): The Mandrake is often associated with powerful magical and protective qualities. Its roots resemble a human figure, representing the connection between humanity and the earth. In this context, the Mandrake root signifies the grounding of the soul and can help initiates in their spiritual journey. The leaves of the Mandrake signify the expansion of awareness, and the fruit represents forbidden knowledge – a nod to the biblical Tree of Knowledge.

2. Belladonna (Atropa Belladonna): Also known as Deadly Nightshade, Belladonna is linked to the realms of the supernatural, transformation, and transmutation. The roots are often used as an ingredient in flying ointments for witches, symbolizing a transition into altered states of consciousness. The leaves, when ingested, are poisonous, signifying the potential danger of delving too deeply into the unknown. However, the dark purple flowers of Belladonna symbolize spiritual insight, teaching us the importance of balance when navigating the mysteries of death.

3. Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger): Associated with communication with the dead and underworld, Henbane is a powerful hallucinogenic. Its roots are the foundation for opening the door to the afterlife. The leaves symbolize the path toward understanding and reconciling our mortal existence with what lies beyond, while the blossoms can aid in divination and prophetic dreams.

4. Yew (Taxus baccata): The Yew tree, a symbol of immortality and regeneration, has long been associated with graveyards and the afterlife. Its roots delve deep into the underworld, connecting the realms of the living and the dead. The leaves, evergreen, are symbolic of eternal life and spiritual growth, while the red berries signify the alchemical transmutation one must undergo to penetrate the Mysteries of Death.

5. Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium): Traditionally linked to psychic abilities and divination, Wormwood’s roots teach us about delving deep into our psyche to uncover hidden truths. Its feathery leaves signify the wings of transformation that allow us to move beyond physical limitations, and the bitter blossoms encapsulate the challenging aspects of initiating oneself into the mysteries of death, mirroring the bitterness of mortality.

Taking these associations and symbolisms into account, we can see that the plants of Death's fell garden play an essential role in unveiling the mysteries surrounding death and spiritual growth. Each plant embodies specific aspects of the cyclical nature of life and beyond.

In summary, the key themes present in this exploration include the cyclical nature of life, transmutation of consciousness, initiation into the mysteries of death, and symbolism associated with various flora. By understanding the critical associations between these plants, herbs, and flowers and their roots, leaves, and blossoms, one can gain deep insights into the journey of the soul and the occult significance that connects life and death.
