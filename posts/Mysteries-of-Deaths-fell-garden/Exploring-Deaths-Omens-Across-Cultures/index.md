In order to complete the task thoroughly, it is essential to embark upon a vast, meandering journey through the shadowy and convoluted passageways of Death's fell garden. Herein lie ancient secrets, impossibly tangled roots, and vegetation dripping with the viscera of time. Therefore, I shall categorize the exploration into four main facets: Spectral visitations, inauspicious animals and plants, aberrant celestial phenomena, and uncategorized omens.

1. **Spectral Visitations**

- The Banshee (Ireland): The procession of this female spirit accompanied with wails warns of an impending death. It is believed that the Banshee's appearance signals the end of a family line.
- La Llorona (Mexico): A remorseful apparition of a woman who regrets drowning her children, La Llorona cries out for her lost little ones, and any who approach her risk suffering a similar fate.
- Will-o'-the-Wisps (Various cultures): These ethereal, shape-shifting beings, usually seen as glowing orbs of light, can lure travelers deep into haunted, perilous locations, never to be seen again.

2. **Inauspicious Animals and Plants**

- The Black Dog (England): This ominous, black canine with glowing red eyes is said to bring misfortune and even death upon those who cross its path multiple times.
- Owls (Various cultures): The haunting hoots of owls, specifically the appearance of a barn owl, often signal the approach of death, as these enigmatic birds are associated with wisdom and the ability to see beyond what is easily perceived.
- The Mandrake Plant (Europe): A plant with a human-shaped root that was believed to scream upon being uprooted. The shrieks could cause insanity and even death, thus mandrakes became associated with curses and witchcraft.

3. **Aberrant Celestial Phenomena**

- Comets (Various cultures): Comets have long been viewed as harbingers of doom. Many ancient civilizations, including the Romans and the Chinese, considered their appearance to be a precursor of sickness, death, and destruction.
- Eclipses (Various cultures): The sudden disappearance of celestial bodies foretells tragedy and disruption. The Maya believed that an eclipse could lead to famine, death, and the arrival of malevolent forces.

4. **Uncategorized Omens**

- Meteors (Various cultures): Though often stunning to behold, the appearance of meteors has been feared for millennia. They are frequently regarded as an omen of disaster or even the end of the world.
- The Death Watch Beetle (Various cultures): The ominous ticking of this tenacious insect's mandibles foretells the demise of a loved one of the dwelling's residents.

It becomes clear that omens of death, as varied as they may seem across cultures, share eerie commonalities. Whether a manifestation of spectral forewarning or a portent grounded in the natural world, these omens captivate the human psyche as a testament to the eternal presence and power of Death's fell garden in our shared experience.
