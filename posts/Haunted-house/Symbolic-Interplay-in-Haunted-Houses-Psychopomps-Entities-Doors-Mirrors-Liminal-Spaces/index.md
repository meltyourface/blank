To fully understand the symbolic relationships between the psychopomp and the entity haunting the house, it is important to first establish what these concepts actually represent. The term "psychopomp" essentially translates to "guide of souls," and within the esoteric and occult practices, it refers to those beings, supernatural or deific, which guide spirits to the afterlife. These beings act as intermediaries between the physical and spiritual realms, and can be found in numerous cultural traditions such as Hermes in Greek mythology or Anubis in Egyptian mythology. In the context of a haunted house, the psychopomp may act as a guide for the lost or trapped spirits, leading them out from the earthly plane.

On the other hand, the entity haunting the house symbolizes a restless or trapped spirit that has, for one reason or another, failed to move on to the afterlife. These entities can manifest in various forms, with differing motives and characteristics, from malevolent to benign. The haunting entity may be trapped due to unresolved issues, unwillingness, or failure in life or death, or simply lost and confused.

Now that we have established the roles and attributes of both the psychopomp and the entity haunting the house, let's consider the symbolism of doors, mirrors, and liminal spaces within the esoteric and occult traditions.

Doors, in the esoteric and occult context, represent opportunities, transitions, and passages between different states of being or existence. They serve as thresholds and portals to other realms, and are often depicted as gateways to the afterlife or other dimensions. Within a haunted house, a door can symbolize the opening to unresolved memories, hidden emotions, or the actual barrier that separates the entity haunting the house from the afterlife.

Mirrors, on the other hand, are often regarded as magical or mysterious objects, capable of revealing deep truths, hidden secrets, or reflecting one's true self. They can also act as portals to other dimensions or realities, allowing travel between realms or communication with entities. In a haunted house, mirrors may be the medium through which the haunting entity communicates or reveals itself, possibly trapping the spirit within its reflection as it tries to reach out to the living world.

Liminal spaces refer to those locations that exist at the boundaries or intersections of two different realms. These areas are often considered "in-between" spaces, where the rules and boundaries that govern everyday reality are blurred or suspended. Examples of liminal spaces include crossroads, shorelines, and twilight hours. In the context of a haunted house, liminal spaces may serve as the connecting points, where communication or manifestation between the haunting entity and the physical world is more easily facilitated.

Within haunted houses, there exists a complex interplay between the psychopomp, the entity haunting the house, and these objects or spaces of symbolism. The psychopomp may guide or oversee the haunting entity's attempts to move on or resolve its unfinished business. At the same time, the spirit may try to manipulate or interact with these symbolic objects and spaces to enable its transition to the next realm or to communicate with the living world.

To sum up, the symbolic relationships between the psychopomp and the entity haunting the house lie in the guiding role of the psychopomp and the trapped spirit's attempts to communicate, escape, or resolve its issues. Doors, mirrors, and liminal spaces stand as symbols and facilitators of this interaction, representing passages, gateways, and points of connection at the boundary of life and the afterlife. These relationships highlight the inherent tension and struggle between the need for resolution and the struggle to let go, complex interactions between different realms, and the allure of the mysterious and unknown. Ultimately, the haunted house serves as the stage upon which these relationships, dramas, and spiritual yearnings play out, resonating with our deeper human understanding of life, death, and the need for closure.
