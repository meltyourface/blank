Verse I:
In darkness, silence, the temple stands,
Where sacred gnosis whispers soft commands,
Upon the altar, flames flicker bright,
The Gnostic Mass commences, clothed in night.

Verse II:
The Priestess embodies, our Lady Nuit,
The endless sky, where stars in union suit,
Her presence graced, all veiled and mystic,
Ready to usher in, the rite euphoric.

Verse III:
The Priest approaches, Hadit unwinds,
In heart of hearts, the fire ever binds,
He lifts the veil, and greets the deity,
Their union blessed, a sacred Trinity.

Verse IV:
The Deacon enters, bearing light and word,
The congregation heeds, the truth conferred,
Through proclamation, sacred texts are shown,
The Law of Thelema, now carved in stone.

Verse V:
With every step, a ritual unveiled,
Exalted figures, in essence unassailed,
The Priestess summons, Ra-Hoor-Khuit aglow,
Triumphant sun, to whom all secrets bow,

Verse VI:
The Mass continues, gestures rich in meaning,
Consecrated elements, for souls' redeeming,
The Congregation partakes, of Cake and Wine,
Through symbols shared, their essences entwine.

Verse VII:
As Nuit and Hadit unite in revelry,
The world unfolds, in sweetest harmony,
The play of forces, Love and Will collide,
In cosmic dance, no truth can e'er divide.

Verse VIII:
The Gnostic Mass, an allegory concealed,
Enigmatic worship, hidden truths revealed,
Each role a symbol, in mystical array,
Through power of Thelema, serenades display.

Verse IX:
And thus concludes, the ceremony grand,
Within the temple, secrets understand,
As shadows fade, the darkness takes its leave,
Each soul enlightened, by what they now perceive.
