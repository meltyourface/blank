Pointed arches

In the context of 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture, pointed arches were particularly influenced by medieval design and held significant symbolic meaning within the nature of the occult, while also representing critical aspects of the time period.

The Gothic Revival movement was primarily a reaction against the Neoclassical architecture of the time, which was considered plain and prosaic. Gothic Revival sought to evoke the grandeur, mystery, and spirituality of the medieval era, which was seen as a time of true faith and artistic expression. This style took its inspiration from medieval Gothic architecture, particularly the religious structures, such as cathedrals and churches.

Pointed arches were a defining characteristic of medieval Gothic architecture, with their popularity peaking in the 12th to 14th centuries. The shape of the arch was both functional and symbolic. Its structural properties allowed for more flexible and versatile construction, as well as improved load distribution. This enabled designers to create larger and more elaborate buildings with increased window space, allowing for natural light to flood through stained glass windows and create a divine atmosphere inside the church.

Symbolically, the pointed arch held great significance within the nature of the occult and the wider Gothic aesthetic. Its upward-pointing shape was seen as a representation of the ascent towards Heaven or the divine, serving as a visual metaphor for the religious aspirations and spiritual inclinations of the people. The pointed arch's resemblance to the sacred geometry found in nature, such as crystals and natural formations, gave it further connections to esoteric and mystical knowledge.

While the other architectural elements, such as vaulted ceilings with ribbed details, thrust-reducing structures in flying buttresses, and gargoyles and grotesque sculptures, were also significant components of Gothic Revival architecture, they did not hold the same level of symbolic meaning with regards to the occult as the pointed arch did. Vaulted ceilings and flying buttresses primarily served as structural advancements, while gargoyles and grotesque sculptures held a more decorative function and represented superstitious beliefs or served as artistic expressions of the medieval craftsmen.

To conclude, it was the pointed arch that truly encapsulated the essence and ideals of the 18th-century Gothic Revival movement: the evocation of the mystical and enigmatic nature of the medieval past combined with a sense of harnessing the knowledge of the occult. Through its symbolic and structural properties, the pointed arch acted as a gateway to understanding the intricate and fascinating world of Gothic Revival architecture and its connection to the esoteric arts.
