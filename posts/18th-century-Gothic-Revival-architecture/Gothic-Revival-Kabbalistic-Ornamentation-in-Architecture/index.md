The correct answer is:

The incorporation of hidden symbols and patterns inspired by the Kabbalah in building ornamentation.

In the context of 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture, the incorporation of hidden symbols and patterns inspired by the Kabbalah in building ornamentation demonstrates a deep understanding of the influence of the occult and esoteric practices on architectural design. The Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism that originated in the 12th century. It is based on the belief that divine secrets can be discovered through the investigation of texts, numbers, and symbols in the Hebrew Bible and other Jewish writings. 

The Gothic Revival movement, which began in the mid-18th century, sought to bring back the highly romantic and mystical elements of medieval Gothic architecture. This movement emerged partly as a reaction against the rationalism and symmetry of the Enlightenment-era Neoclassical style. Design principles from esoteric and occult sources, such as the Kabbalah, played a role in shaping the overall aesthetic and philosophical framework of Gothic Revival architecture, forging connections between religion, mysticism, and art.

Of the other options:

The prevalence of square and rectilinear designs as opposed to traditional Gothic circular forms, influenced by the sacred geometry principles, is not a defining characteristic of Gothic Revival architecture. While sacred geometry did play a role in some architectural movements, the connection between the square forms and esoteric practices is not unique to the 18th-century Gothic Revival movement.

The use of pointed arches, rib vaults, and flying buttresses to create a mystical atmosphere within the structure was a hallmark of Gothic architecture from the 12th to the 16th century. Although these elements were also used in Gothic Revival architecture, they were derived from traditional Gothic architectural design and were not influenced directly by esoteric or occult practices.

An increased focus on darker color palettes and dimly lit interiors to evoke the feel of ancient rituals and spiritual ceremonies may have been present to some degree. However, this aspect is more a consequence of the overall aesthetics of Gothic Revival architecture rather than a conscious reflection of occult influences. Elements such as stained-glass windows, which filtered in colored light, did create a spiritual atmosphere, but they were not directly related to occult practices.

Overall, the most accurate representation of the influence of occult and esoteric practices on 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture can be seen in the incorporation of hidden symbols and patterns inspired by the Kabbalah. This deliberate infusion of mystical elements contributes to the distinct and powerful spiritual aura of Gothic Revival structures.
