The correct answer is: Pointed arches, reflecting the aspirations toward the heavens and spiritual elevation.

The Gothic Revival movement, which began in the mid-18th century and continued into the 19th century, sought to revive the aesthetics and symbolism of medieval Gothic architecture. Architects during this time were purposefully incorporating stylistic elements from medieval designs into their works. The aim was to evoke a sense of mystery and spirituality associated with the past, lending an air of ancient wisdom to the modern world.

Pointed arches, one of the most characteristic features of Gothic architecture, were highly popular in this era. They can be found not just in religious buildings but also in secular structures such as libraries, universities, and private homes. Apart from their aesthetic appeal, pointed arches also served a practical purpose: they distributed the weight of a building more evenly, which allowed for taller and more slender structures. This upward orientation, reaching towards the heavens, is symbolic of spiritual elevation and divine aspirations.

While flying buttresses, gargoyles, and cruciform floor plans are also components of Gothic architecture, they do not carry the same depth of symbolic meaning as pointed arches in the context of the Gothic Revival movement.

Flying buttresses are an important structural element, designed to provide support for the walls and prevent them from buckling. However, their adoption during the Gothic Revival was largely based on their aesthetic appeal and connection to the past, not on their symbolic meaning.

Gargoyles, as functional and decorative elements, served multiple purposes in Gothic architecture, such as diverting rainwater away from buildings and fending off evil spirits. Their incorporation during the Gothic Revival might symbolize a continuity of these medieval beliefs, but they were not the central element used to evoke spirituality and mystery.

Cruciform floor plans, which resemble the shape of a cross, were common in ecclesiastical architecture. Although they represent a religious symbol, their adoption during the Gothic Revival was more aligned with a secular focus on time and space, rather than the deep spiritual symbolism and transcendence suggested by pointed arches.

In summary, pointed arches not only reflect the aspirations toward the heavens and spiritual elevation but also demonstrate a deep understanding of the stylistic and symbolic elements that originated from medieval Gothic designs and were intentionally incorporated by architects during the 18th-century Gothic Revival.
