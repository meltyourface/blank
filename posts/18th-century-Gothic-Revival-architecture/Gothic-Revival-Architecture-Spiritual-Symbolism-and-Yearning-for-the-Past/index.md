Introduction:
In order to fully understand the intricate relationship between 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture and its esoteric symbolism, it is important to first define and explain the fundamental concepts of this topic. Gothic Revival architecture refers to an architectural movement that emerged in the 18th century, heavily inspired and characterized by the elements of medieval Gothic architecture. Esoteric symbolism, on the other hand, encompasses the use of secret or hidden meanings and messages within various forms of art, including architecture.

Influential Designers:
Two of the most influential designers who played a crucial role in the development of Gothic Revival architecture were Horace Walpole and Augustus Pugin. Walpole, an English writer, art historian, and politician, is often credited as the "father" of Gothic Revival architecture, as he embraced Gothic elements in his own home, Strawberry Hill. This personal architectural project sparked interest and appreciation for Gothic architecture, resulting in a surge of revivalist designs. Augustus Pugin, an English architect and designer, was an ardent advocate of reviving the Gothic style. Through his designs (such as the Houses of Parliament) and theoretical writings, he emphasized the superiority of Gothic architecture over Neoclassical styles.

Gothic Revival Architecture and Esoteric Symbolism:
Now that we have established the importance of Walpole and Pugin in promoting Gothic Revival architecture let's analyze the connection with esoteric symbolism. Gothic Revival architecture was not just a stylistic preference, but it embodied a deeper sense of spiritualism, mysticism, and a longing for the past.

The Gothic Revival style relied heavily on the use of symbolism through elements such as pointed arches, intricate designs, and a focus on verticality. These esoteric symbols were often of religious or spiritual significance, reflecting the architecture's connection with early Christian churches. This affinity towards the symbols of the past was, in part, a reaction against the Enlightenment's rationalist approach that favored reason and empirical evidence over spiritual understanding.

Enlightenment-era Beliefs and Values vs. Gothic Revival Esoteric Symbolism:
The 18th-century Enlightenment period, also known as the Age of Reason, placed great emphasis on secularism, reason, and liberality, challenging traditional religious beliefs and authorities. The Gothic Revival architecture's esoteric symbolism can be seen as a response to this shift in cultural values, as it aimed to reintroduce a sense of spirituality and mysticism.

Implications for the Interpretation of Gothic Revival Architecture:
When examining the broader implications of the relationship between 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture and the esoteric symbolism it employed, several conclusions can be drawn:

1. Gothic Revival architecture can be viewed as a manifestation of the human desire for transcendental knowledge and a connection with the spiritual realm, as it promotes the use of symbolism as a means of conveying hidden meanings.

2. The use of esoteric symbolism in Gothic Revival architecture is not merely a stylistic preference, but rather a reflection of the historical, cultural, and intellectual context in which this architectural movement emerged, emphasizing the importance of understanding the broader context to fully appreciate and analyze the architecture.

3. The contrast between the Enlightenment-era beliefs and values, and the spiritualism and mysticism promoted by the Gothic Revival architecture highlights the dynamic nature of cultural values and the shifting priorities and interests of society across time.

In summary, the 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture movement was characterized by its intricate connections to esoteric symbolism, spiritualism, and a yearning for the past. This affinity was partially in response to the Enlightenment-era beliefs and values, emphasizing secularism and reason. Designers like Walpole and Pugin promoted this style and their works became an embodiment of human pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Finally, fully understanding Gothic Revival architecture requires examining it within the broader historical, cultural, and intellectual context.
