Introductory Context:
In order to approach this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the key concepts and elements involved. The Gothic Revival architecture style emerged in the 18th century, inspired by the medieval Gothic style. This period was marked by the Romanticism movement, which greatly influenced art, literature, and intellectual thought. Awe and terror as a psychological component played a significant role in the aesthetics of this period, and the architectural theories of Vitruvius were still considered foundational to the discipline of architecture. By exploring these elements, we can delve into the intricacies of how 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture embodies their intersection.

The Romantic Period:
The Romantic period (around 1800-1850) was characterized by a shift in focus from reason and logic to emotion, individualism, and the value of personal experience. This movement was in many ways a reaction to the intellectual ideals of the Enlightenment and the societal changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. The Gothic Revival emerged as part of this cultural movement, reinterpreting the aesthetics and values of medieval architecture suited to the new spiritual, emotional, and social desires of the time.

Psychological Components - Awe and Terror:
The Romantic imagination was naturally drawn to the notions of awe and terror. This interest stemmed from the fascination with the sublime, which is a form of aesthetic pleasure derived from observing overwhelming natural or artistic phenomena that inspire both fear and admiration. Gothic Revival architecture incorporated these sensations through its structures, which often featured towering spires, dramatic contrasts between light and shadow, and intricate ornamentation. These design elements were meant to invoke a sense of awe and terror in the observer, reflecting the broader cultural interests of the period.

Advancement of Vitruvius' Architectural Tenets:
Vitruvius, a Roman architect and engineer, formulated principles that guided architecture for centuries. These principles, as recorded in his treatise De Architectura, can be summarized as the concepts of utilitas (function or utility), firmitas (durability or strength), and venustas (beauty or aesthetics). Although 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture seemed to diverge from classical Roman styles, it remained grounded in Vitruvius' tenets. The reimagined Gothic structures adhered to the fundamentals of providing functional spaces, ensuring structural stability, and achieving a visually appealing form. In doing so, they managed to incorporate the contemporary values of Romanticism and the medieval era into their designs while still following the inherited architectural wisdom of Vitruvius.

Reimagining of Ideals and Values of the Medieval Era:
The 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture sought to reconnect with the cultural, religious, and artistic values of the medieval era, which were regarded as more in touch with emotional and spiritual aspects of human life. As a result, this architectural style often drew on the designs of medieval Gothic cathedrals, with their pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and ornate sculptures, as sources of inspiration. By weaving together the interests of Romanticism, the psychological components of awe and terror, and the architectural principles of Vitruvius, the Gothic Revival managed to reinterpret these medieval elements into new expressions that appealed to the 18th-century sensibilities.

Key Themes, Ideas, and Conclusions:
In conclusion, the development of 18th-century Gothic Revival architecture exemplified an intricate interplay among several intersecting factors: the socio-cultural context of the Romantic period, the psychological aspects of awe and terror, the architectural tenets of Vitruvius, and a reimagining of ideals and values of the medieval era. The Romantic emphasis on emotion, individualism, and the sublime influenced the aesthetics and function of Gothic Revival structures, which sought to evoke feelings of awe and terror while adhering to Vitruvius' architectural principles. By reinterpreting and amalgamating these diverse influences, Gothic Revival architecture succeeded in creating a distinctive style that embodied both the spirit of the 18th century and a revitalized appreciation for medieval aesthetics, culture, and values.
