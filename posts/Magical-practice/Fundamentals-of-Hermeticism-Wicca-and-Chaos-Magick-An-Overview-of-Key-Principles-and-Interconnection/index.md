In response to the knowledge challenge, I will analyze the fundamental principles of three significant magical traditions, namely Hermeticism, Wicca, and Chaos Magick. I will demonstrate their interconnectedness, evolution, and highlight key differences in their approaches and ethics regarding magical practice. 

1. Hermeticism

Hermeticism is a philosophical and spiritual tradition that stems from the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, an ancient Egyptian sage. It has had a significant influence on Western magick. The tradition's primary text is the Corpus Hermeticum, a set of religious-philosophical treatises. 

**Fundamental Principles**: 
- The most fundamental principle of Hermeticism is the concept of correspondence, captured in the phrase, "As above, so below." This emphasizes the interconnections among all aspects of reality, whether physical, mental, or spiritual.
- The doctrine of the Seven Hermetic Principles, which describe the underlying mechanics of the universe and how they operate. These principles include mentalism, correspondence, vibration, polarity, rhythm, causation, and gender.
- The ultimate goal is spiritual transformation and the attainment of divine wisdom. Many practices, including magick, are seen as tools for self-improvement and attaining spiritual awareness.

2. Wicca

Wicca, founded in the mid-20th century by Gerald Gardner, is a modern Pagan, witchcraft magical tradition. It emphasizes the worship of a dualistic deity, the God and Goddess, and the use of rituals and spells to establish a harmonious relationship with the natural environment.

**Fundamental Principles**: 
- The belief in the polarities of the divine, represented by the God and Goddess, embodying masculine and feminine energies.
- The Wheel of the Year, which is divided into eight Sabbats. These festivals mark the changing of the seasons, and rituals and celebrations take place accordingly.
- The Wiccan Rede, a moral code that states, "An' it harm none, do what ye will," emphasizing ethical conduct and personal responsibility.
- The Law of Threefold Return, which suggests that whatever energy one sends out into the world, whether good or bad, will come back threefold.

3. Chaos Magick

Chaos Magick is a contemporary magical tradition developed in the 1970s by Peter J. Carroll and others. It emphasizes the use of personal experience and experimentation over dogma and beliefs, focusing on practical, results-oriented techniques tailored to the individual practitioner.

Fundamental Principles:
- Practitioners of Chaos Magick are encouraged to utilize whatever symbols, practices, and beliefs they find most useful and compelling.
- The concept of belief as a tool rather than an absolute truth. Practitioners use techniques such as "paradigm shifting" to switch between belief systems temporarily as needed.
- Use of sigils, visual or symbolic representations of intent, fuelled by the magician's willpower and energy, as a means to manifest desired outcomes.

Interconnectedness and Evolution:
- Hermeticism has influenced the development of various magical traditions, including Wicca and Chaos Magick. The principle of correspondence and the ideas of self-improvement and attaining spiritual awareness are present in both traditions.
- Wicca, along with other forms of modern witchcraft, has been influenced by Hermeticism and incorporates many of its concepts, such as the correspondence between the microcosm and the macrocosm.
- Chaos Magick developed as a reaction against the perceived rigidity of traditional systems like Wicca and Hermeticism. However, it often borrows or adapts elements from these traditions, leading to an evolved synthesis of different magical paradigms.

Key Differences in Approaches and Ethics:

- Hermeticism is focused on spiritual transformation through divine wisdom and emphasizes the importance of understanding the theoretical principles underlying magick. Ethical considerations tend to center around the pursuit of divine knowledge and spiritual development.
- Wicca is a religion-based magical tradition that incorporates ethics such as the Wiccan Rede and the Law of Threefold Return, insisting on personal responsibility and a harmonious relationship with the natural world.
- Chaos Magick is more practical, experimentation-based, and relativistic, allowing practitioners to adapt and tailor their practices as they see fit. Ethics are more subjective, determined by individual preferences rather than a rigid moral code.

In summary, the magical traditions of Hermeticism, Wicca, and Chaos Magick all share a common thread of interconnectedness and evolution while differing in their approach and ethical considerations. Hermeticism is more focused on the attainment of divine wisdom, Wicca centers around the worship of nature and personal responsibility, and Chaos Magick emphasizes individual experience and practical results.
