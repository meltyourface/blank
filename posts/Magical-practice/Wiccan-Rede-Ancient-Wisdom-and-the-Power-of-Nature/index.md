  Craft a spellbinding and enchanting poem centered on the core principles and ethos of the Wiccan Rede, infusing the verses with symbolism and metaphors representing the elements, the Triple Goddess, and the Horned God. Expound upon the interconnectedness of all things, delve into the moral guidance of "An ye harm none, do what ye will," and manifest the cyclical nature of life through the poem's structure and rhythm.

In the twilight of the crescent moon's gleam,
Whispers the wind with secrets to redeem,
Unveil the verse, a map for those unseen,
To walk the path between shadows and the dream.

By earth and air, fire, water entwined,
The elements dance in circle, aligned,
For through their union, the mysteries unwind,
In shadows of the sacred, truth we find.

Beneath the wax and wane, the Triple slumbers,
Maiden, Mother, Crone â€” by three, in numbers,
Each holding keys to fortune and the tides,
All things connected, to their cycle binds.

The Horned God, in woodland shadows roams,
His music seethes with life, the sapling's moans,
Together with the Triple, two-made-one,
A love divine from which all life has sprung.

Untainted streams carry this code to heart,
In soaring eagle's wing, all life takes part,
In every creature's cry, in roots that grip,
And in the sea's lament, as tides do rip.

An ye harm none, do what ye will, it calls,
This truth engraved upon the twisting walls,
The labyrinth's core where balance is found,
By understanding's gift, we shall be bound.

Our lives in tune with the turning of the wheel,
Like season's kiss upon the sunlit fields,
We rise and fall like waves upon the shore,
Yet find rebirth in life's eternal door.

Through hidden verse, the Wiccan Rede implores,
Insight to the heart of nature, restores,
So chant these words and let the magic flow,
Connected by invisible threads, we grow.

As night enfolds the day and new moon rises,
From life, rebirth, and death, we find our prizes,
We honor Earth, our Mother's luscious skin,
Awakening the power that lies within.
