Designing the Talisman for Personal Transformation and Protection:

The talisman is designed with the utmost consideration for metaphysical properties, symbolism, and harmony. Its purpose is to facilitate personal transformation and provide protection on one's journey of self-change. 

**Materials**:
1. ****Copper****: As a powerful conductor of energy, copper serves as the base material for this talisman. It strengthens the channels of energy flow, enhancing the talisman's ability to harness and direct power.
2. ****Amethyst****: This powerful and protective crystal promotes spiritual growth and development. It helps in dispelling negative energy and improving one's intuition, making it an essential component of the talisman.
3. ****Quartz****: Known as the "master healer," quartz amplifies the energies of all the elements present in the talisman. It clears away any energetic or emotional blockages and strengthens the connection with one's higher self.
4. ****Moonstone****: A stone of new beginnings, moonstone stabilizes emotions and promotes inner growth. It fosters inspiration and helps in navigating life transitions, making it an important part of the talisman's purpose.

**Symbols**:
1. ****The Spiral****: As a timeless symbol of growth and evolution, the spiral represents the ever-changing, never-ending process of personal transformation. Placed at the center of the talisman, it serves as a reminder of the journey towards the development of one's true self.
2. ****The Ouroboros****: This ancient symbol depicts a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, signifying the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. This reinforces the idea that personal growth requires the release of old habits and patterns and embracing new experiences and ways of thinking.
3. ****The Seed of Life****: As a symbol of creation and fertility, the Seed of Life represents the potential for growth and advancement in one's life. Positioned within the talisman, it promotes the development of skills, talents, and a deeper understanding of oneself.
4. ****The Eye of Horus****: Known to offer protection, the Eye of Horus safeguards the wearer from both physical and spiritual harm. By including this symbol, the talisman aims to ensure a safe and secure journey of self-change.

Visual representation:

Picture a circular talisman with a diameter of 2 inches, made of copper with an aged patina finish, giving it a sense of timeless wisdom. Engraved at the center is the spiral, with the Ouroboros forming a border. Along the outer edge is a continuous line of Seed of Life symbols. 

The Amethyst, Quartz, and Moonstone crystals form an equilateral triangle around the central spiral. In the empty spaces between the triangle's points, symmetrically placed are three Eye of Horus symbols.

The talisman's design exudes harmony, balance, and precision. ****Each material and symbol plays a crucial role in manifesting its purpose****: to foster personal transformation and provide protection throughout the journey of self-change.
