  Spirits of the shadows, I convoke you,
  In nomine potestatis, darkness I pursue.
  
  Ancient deities gather 'round,
  Combine your forces, salvation unbound.
  
  From blood-soaked corners enshrouded deep,
  Where mist and fog o' er tombstones creep,
  
  Atropa belladonna, plant of malediction,
  Lend me your blight, conjure dread and affliction,
  Poisoned lashes, nightshade's bane,
  Embody desire, suffering, and pain.
  
  Mandragora officinarum, sorcerer's root,
  Whose screams in death's embrace our senses pollute,
  Unearthed by moon's bewitching glow,
  Lend your essence for the waking blow.
  
  Artemisia absinthium, wormwood deceitful,
  Spawn of Hades, bitter and lethal,
  Thespian visions, whispered lies,
  Grant us secrets, veiled in moonlit skies.
  
  Tertium conjugate, in fablis quondam,
  Succumb to the call, nomen infernum.
  
  By the powers of the trinity united,
  The malevolent essence, by blood the pact is cited,
  The diabolic thoughtform, whose presence awaits,
  Incerpicor thy chthonic malice, enslave our fates.
  
  Dum nocte silentium throbs,
  Voco te advenire, bring forth the force that robs.
  
  Let fire burn and shadows dance,
  Summon the form that transcends the ensorcelled trance,
  In nomen Atropa, Mandragora, Artemisia,
  Thoughtform malignant, heed my incantation obscura.
  
  Come forth, o spirit, let wickedness entwine,
  Rise from the depths, seep from the cobblestone's spine,
  Quod chori ad celebrationem, an offering to the nameless doom,
  From the roots' union, let the malevolent thoughtform consume.
  
  In cadaveros cadentibus, we chant,
  By the twisted thorns, this incantation implant,
  Anima connecta, in dominion's key,
  Spirit of the night, ascend, and grant our sinful plea.
