Occult Terminology: A Grimoire Glossary

1. ****Alchemy****: An ancient mystical and philosophical discipline that sought the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, primarily gold, as well as the creation of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance capable of bestowing eternal life and enlightenment. Alchemy has also been interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual transformation.

2. ****Astral Plane****: A non-physical realm, or plane of existence, that overlaps with the physical world. It is said to be populated by various spirits, angels, demons, and other entities, as well as accessible through methods such as astral projection, meditation, and altered states of consciousness.

3. ****Divination****: The practice of seeking knowledge of the future, hidden events, or other esoteric information through various means, such as interpreting signs and symbols or through direct communication with spiritual entities. Common methods of divination include tarot card reading, astrology, and scrying.

4. ****Egregore****: A thought-form or collective energy, created and sustained by the focused intentions and emotions of a group of individuals. Egregores can influence and manifest events in the physical world or empower rituals and spells in the practice of magick.

5. ****Hermeticism****: A philosophical and religious tradition focused on the study of the hidden mysteries of nature, the cosmos, and the self. Hermeticism has its roots in Hellenistic Egypt and teaches principles of mentalism, correspondence, vibration, polarity, rhythm, cause and effect, and the existence of the spiritual plane.

6. ****Invocation****: The act of summoning or inviting spiritual entities, such as deities, angels, or other. Invocations are generally performed to ask for help, guidance, or blessings, and are an essential aspect of ritual magick and theurgy.

7. ****Magick****: The practice of using and manipulating occult forces and energies to create change in accordance with one's will. Magick encompasses various techniques, including visualization, ritual, symbolism, and the use of talismans, amulets, and sigils.

8. ****Occult****: A term that refers to the study and practice of hidden, secretive, or esoteric knowledge. In a broader sense, the term encompasses various disciplines such as astrology, alchemy, magick, and divination, as well as secret societies and mystical traditions.

9. ****Sigil****: A symbol, usually created by the practitioner, that holds a specific intention, desire, or power. Sigils can be charged and activated through various methods, such as meditation, visualization, or ritual, and are often incorporated into spells and other magickal workings.

10. ****Theurgy****: A form of ritual magick that seeks to establish a direct connection with the divine, usually through the invocation or evocation of deities, angels, or other spiritual entities. Theurgy is often regarded as a form of spiritual ascent, providing the practitioner with enhanced wisdom, power, and spiritual transformation.
