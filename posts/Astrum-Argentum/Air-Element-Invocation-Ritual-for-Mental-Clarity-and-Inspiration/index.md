(d) Touch the left shoulder and intone: "ve-Gedulah" (and the Glory)
(e) Fold hands upon chest and intone: "le-Olahm, Amen" (forever, Amen)

3. **Trace the Sigil of Air in the air with the Ceremonial Sword or Dagger while reciting the following invocation**:
"I invoke and call upon the element of Air, the Exalted Wind, Ruach, the Breath of Life. By the power of the Holy Names YHVH, I command thy presence and blessings."

4. Make the following ritual gestures with the Sword or Dagger, in alignment with the Air element:
(a) Trace a sweeping horizontal line from left to right.
(b) Trace a gentle upward spiral, symbolizing the upward movement of Air.
(c) Make a series of quick, sharp thrusts to represent the precise, cutting nature of Air.

"Zephyros, Notus, Boreas, Eurus â€“ Spirits of the Four Winds, be present and attune me to your essence. Grant me the wisdom of Athena, the eloquence of Hermes, and the inspiration of Apollo."

6. Meditate on the connection with the element of Air and visualize the energy surrounding and permeating your being.

7. Perform the Qabalistic Cross once again, sealing the energies invoked during the ritual.
