## I. The Summoning of Otherworldly Beings

By the waxing crescent, in the twilight hour,
Utter the name from the astral tower.
Call forth the creature, born of shadow and mist,
Its form shrouded in an obsidian abyss.

With obsidian blade and serpent's heart,
Purge the sigil on parchment, impart
The language forgotten, the words of despair,
Borne from the whispers of the timeless lair.

The circle of salt, the blood of the lamb,
Drawn from the solstice when Sirius am.
Ignite the darkness, the candle of bone,
Reveal the doorway, the cosmic unknown.

### II. Forbidden Tomes and Grimoires

In the catacombs buried, where echoes now dwell,
Lies the Muspelheim Manuscripts, keys to darkest spell.
Parchments of knowledge, penned by forgotten hands,
Reveal the true nature and the fate of the lands.

By the bloodmoon's rise, its cipher's decoded,
Releasing the wisdom of aeons eroded.

### III. Astral Projection and Ethereal Exploration

To float through the veil, the spirit untethered,
Unbind from the flesh, become light as a feather.
Drink of the potion, the distillation of larkspur,
Place crystals of power, encircling the murmurs.

Open thy chakra, breathe in transcendental air,
Close your eyes, and in blackness declare,
"I walk among stars, my spirit unbound,
To traverse the cosmos, no barriers surround."

### IV. The Art of Divination

With Tarot unveiled, the mysteries unfurl;
Scrying in the mirror, a reflection of the whorl.
Tossing the bones, omnipotent fate reflects,
Revealing the pathways our lives intersect.

The knowledge is cryptic, the messages seething;
The seer engages with energies breathing.

### V. Sacred Geometry and Sigil Creation

In angles and lines, the cosmos converge,
Forming the symbols, where the meanings emerge.
From Metatron's cube, to the pentagram spinning,
The sigil takes life, its magic beginning.

Drawing with intent, and precision of form,
Give birth to the symbols, the sacred transform.

### VI. Dark Alchemy and the Pursuit of Immortality

Elixir of life, forged from mercury's touch,
Transmute baser metals, to gold in our clutch.
Distilled, concentrated, the essence divine,
In pursuit of immortality, we drink of the brine.

Philosopher's stone, the key to eternal binding,
Unlock the secret, through clandestine refining.

### VII. Cursed Relics and Enchanted Artifacts

From catacombs ancient and tombs long forgotten,
We seek out the relics that whisper, begotten.
A chalice, enchanted, or staff of great might,
We venture to find them, in darkness and light.

Beware the cursed object, malevolent and dire,
For those who possess them, awaken the ire.
