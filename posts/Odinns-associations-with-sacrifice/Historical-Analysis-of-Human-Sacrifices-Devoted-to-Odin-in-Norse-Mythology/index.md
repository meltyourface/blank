In order to accurately investigate the historical veracity of human sacrificial rituals dedicated to Odin, it is essential to first delve into the various available sources that provide insight into these practices. Throughout the investigation, the methodologies used, the purpose behind each sacrifice, and any prevailing societal factors that may have influenced these practices will be the primary focus. Upon examining these aspects, the sacrificial practices devoted to Odin will be compared and contrasted with those dedicated to other deities within the Norse pantheon.

One of the most significant primary sources that provide a detailed account of human sacrifices dedicated to Odin is the Ynglinga saga, part of the 13th-century work Heimskringla by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson. The Ynglinga saga contains a description of the Temple at Uppsala, a major religious center in what is now modern-day Sweden, where nine-yearly sacrifices dedicated to Odin took place. The saga reports the sacrifices of nine males from each of the different species, including humans, during the ritual.

Another account worth mentioning is the description by the 10th-century Arab traveler, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who witnessed a Viking ship burial where a slave girl was sacrificially killed as part of a funerary ritual. Though it is not explicitly linked to Odin, ship burials were often reserved for high-ranking individuals and could indicate the presence of warrior elites closely linked to Odin – as he was the chief god and one associated with war and death.

Archaeological evidence, such as the discovery of the bog bodies at Tollund Man and Grauballe Man in Denmark, suggests the use of sacrificial rituals in Norse societies. Although the connections to Odin are not directly evident, the manner of death – specifically death by strangulation, stabbing, or hanging – shows similarities to the way Odin was depicted as sacrificing himself to himself, hanged, and pierced by a spear on the World Tree Yggdrasil in the Hávamál.

As for the purpose behind these sacrifices, it varied, but often revolved around seeking victory in battle, recovery from illness, protection, or divine guidance. Odin, being the god of war, wisdom, and poetry, would receive sacrifices to fulfill these specific desires. There also exists the idea that sacrifices to Odin were meant to maintain the cosmic balance and ensure the continuity of divine favor.

Other deities in the Norse pantheon also received sacrifices, though the methods and purposes varied. In the case of the Vanir gods – like Frey, the god of fertility, and Njord, god of the sea – the sacrifices aimed to secure fruitful harvests, peace, and prosperity. These sacrifices could take the form of animal offerings, votive objects, and, in some instances, human sacrifices; however, detailed data regarding these rites are sparse and open to interpretation.

In conclusion, the practice of human sacrificial rituals dedicated to Odin, although not completely unambiguous, appears to have a historical basis backed by primary and secondary sources and archaeological evidence. The methodologies varied but showed certain trends, particularly in relation to hanging, stabbing, or strangulation. While the purpose of these sacrifices aimed to achieve divine favor or personal gains in various arenas, societal factors such as status, the importance of maintaining cosmic balance, and communal gatherings likely played an influential role. The sacrificial practices dedicated to other Norse deities display both similarities and differences in terms of the methodologies, purposes, and emphasis of the rituals, highlighting the complex and multi-faceted nature of Norse religious practices.
