In the intricate angelic hierarchy, the avenging angels hold a unique position due to their primary roles as divine enforcers and agents of divine justice. While this hierarchy is complex and varies across different belief systems, some of the most notable avenging angels include Michael, Raguel, and Samael.

Avenging angels are often responsible for the administration and execution of divine judgment. In essence, they serve the dual purpose of maintaining balance within celestial realms and ensuring that the natural order of the multidimensional universe remains intact. They are charged with addressing cosmic imbalances, correcting moral injustices, and executing divine wrath upon evildoers, both human and supernatural. 

The relationship between avenging angels and other celestial beings is primarily defined by their status in the hierarchical order. While they hold significant power and authority, avenging angels generally operate within the bounds of divine directives and report to higher-ranking angels or directly to the divine source. However, their duty to maintain cosmic balance means they often work collaboratively with other angels, such as guardian angels or archangels, to achieve their goals.

In terms of duties, avenging angels' key responsibilities range from guarding sacred spaces and objects to watching over and combating those who transgress divine law. They also serve as cosmic protectors against dark forces and entities that seek to disrupt the proper functioning of creation. However, their most crucial function is to be the divine instruments of judgment and retribution, ensuring that those who defy the will of the divine pay the consequences of their actions. 

The impact of avenging angels on the balance of the multidimensional universe is profound. They uphold divine law and morality, ensuring that good and evil stand in equilibrium. By delivering divine justice, they deter potential wrongdoers, thus preserving the harmony and sanctity of creation. Their vigilant presence also offers reassurance and protection to virtuous beings, highlighting the significance of these angels in maintaining order across dimensions. 

When compared to other members of the angelic hierarchy, avenging angels stand out in several key aspects. While most angels serve as guardians, messengers, or divine attendants, avenging angels hold distinctly combative and punitive roles. Their primary responsibility of enforcing divine justice distinguishes them from other celestial beings who offer guidance, healing, knowledge, or inspiration. 

Moreover, avenging angels are often portrayed as more assertive and stern compared to other celestial beings, reflecting their warrior-like nature and unwavering dedication to ensuring adherence to divine law. This steadfast determination sets them apart from other angelic beings, whose roles and functions may expose them to more lenient or compassionate qualities.

In conclusion, the avenging angels are vital members of the intricate angelic hierarchy whose unique roles, functions, and relationships within this celestial order serve to preserve balance, uphold divine morality, and enforce justice across the multidimensional universe. Their comparative distinction from other members of the angelic hierarchy manifests in their warrior-like nature, stern demeanor, and primary role as executioners of divine judgment.
