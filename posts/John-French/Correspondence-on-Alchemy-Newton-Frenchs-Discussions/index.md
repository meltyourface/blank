Letter 1: John French to Sir Isaac Newton
Date: June 12, 1666

Esteemed Sir Isaac Newton,

I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and spirit. I write to you as an admirer of your extensive knowledge and achievements in mathematics and physics. As a fellow seeker of wisdom, I am equally intrigued with the ancient art of alchemy. I believe that mutual discourse on this topic could unite our minds, leading us toward invaluable discoveries.

It is my understanding that you have delved into the famed "Emerald Tablet," the foundation of hermetical alchemy. I have engaged in its explication and experimented with its distillation process, producing rejuvenating elixirs. On the subject of the cornerstone of our art, the Philosopher's Stone, I have pondered the cryptic message "Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem," or "Visit the interior of the earth, and by rectifying, you shall find the hidden stone." 

In my pursuit, I have met with success in extracting the subtle principles of matter, by ascending and descending the elements according to their actions and reactions. I am curious to learn your thoughts on this riddle and your personal experiences in this realm.

Your comrade in the Great Work,

John French


Letter 2: Sir Isaac Newton to John French
Date: June 28, 1666

Dear Master John French,

Indeed, I am thrilled to discuss the alchemical arts with a fellow adept. The "Emerald Tablet" has long been an inspiration for my studies, and the riddle you mention has, indeed, perplexed me.

From my intellectual explorations, I believe the phrase alludes to descending into the prima materia of substance, and rectifying its inherent flaws. This, in turn, would pave the way towards achieving the Magnum Opus.

In my experiments, I have analyzed the three alchemical principles of Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt. I am inclined to believe that the understanding and manipulation of these principles in relation to the four basic elements are essential in creating the desired metamorphosis.

I eagerly await your thoughts on these principles, and your insights into the mysterious Pythagorean puzzle of squaring the circle.

Yours in the quest for knowledge,

Sir Isaac Newton


Letter 3: John French to Sir Isaac Newton
Date: July 15, 1666

My Illustrious Sir Isaac Newton,

Your words align with my own thoughts on the riddle. **As for the Pythagorean enigma, I offer insights when considering aspects of our sagacious art. Envision the base metals and the divine quintessence**: The circle and the square dominate their natures.

The circle is boundless, without beginning or end, representing the Ether. The square, though possessing a clear limit, symbolizes solid matter. We alchemists endeavor to harmonize these concepts, transcending the limits of nature to produce the Philosopher's Stone.

Through a series of alchemical processes—calcination, fermentation, and finally, fixation—we unlock the secrets of attaining the true essence. Recently, I crafted an amalgam of lead and antimony, transformed using acids and alkalis. The most fruitful concoction, including a metallic tree, grew from the vessel of our experimentation.

Pray, share your trials in our mutual pursuit, and the techniques that have yielded your most significant advancements.

In unity, striving towards knowledge,

John French
