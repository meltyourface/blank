To fully understand the connections between John French's work in alchemy and his contributions to education during his time, as well as the influences of hermetic and neoplatonic thoughts on his educational approach, we must first briefly delve into the historical and philosophical context in which he was working. John French was a 17th-century English physician, chemist, and author, best known for his works on alchemy and iatrochemistry, which is the application of chemistry to medicine.

Hermeticism is a philosophical, religious, and esoteric tradition that covers various beliefs and practices based on the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary sage from Hellenistic Egypt. The central tenet of Hermeticism is as above, so below, which implies a correspondence between the macrocosm (the wider universe) and the microcosm (humankind or an individual person).

Neoplatonism, on the other hand, is a philosophical system that developed in the late Roman Empire (3rd century AD). It is based on the works of Plato and his followers, and it synthesizes elements of mysticism, spirituality, and metaphysics. Neoplatonism posits a transcendent One or Infinite as the ultimate source of all existence and emphasizes the soul's ascent towards union with this divine principle.

Now, let's explore how these philosophical traditions tie into John French's work and his contributions to education.

French's alchemical works, such as "The Art of Distillation" (1651), emphasize the importance of understanding and mastering the underlying principles and operations that govern natural processes to derive practical applications in areas like medicine, chemistry, and even agriculture. In his time, alchemy was considered a noble pursuit that could lead to profound insights into the nature of the universe. In this pursuit, knowledge of hermetic principles would be essential, as they establish connections between different spheres of reality.

French's educational approach could be seen as a reflection of both hermeticism and neoplatonism. Hermeticism influenced his emphasis on the relationship between the macrocosm and microcosm, while, with neoplatonism, he believed in the inherent capacity of the human mind to ascend and grasp higher truths. This would lead to an educational approach that stressed not only on practical applications but also on nurturing the intellect and fostering a deep understanding of subjects.

For example, in his alchemical texts, he carefully explains the underlying principles and processes, encouraging students to observe, analyze, and understand the larger contexts and correspondences that govern the workings of the natural world. He guides readers through each step of experimentation, demonstrating that in various phenomena, hermetic and neoplatonic principles play an essential role.

By providing a comprehensive exposition of the subject and making it accessible to a wide range of readers, John French significantly contributed to spreading the knowledge of alchemy and its principles. The fact that his work was translated into multiple languages and republished numerous times attests to the impact he made as an educator during the period. In doing so, he helped to lay the groundwork for a more scientific and empirical understanding of the natural world.

In conclusion, John French's work in alchemy and his contributions to education were deeply intertwined with the hermetic and neoplatonic philosophical principles of his time. He was inspired by the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm, which guided his educational approach and fueled his desire to elucidate the deep connections that govern the natural world. By synthesizing hermetic and neoplatonic ideas into his alchemical texts and educational methods, he managed to bring these esoteric concepts to a wider audience, benefiting the budding scientific community greatly during the period.
