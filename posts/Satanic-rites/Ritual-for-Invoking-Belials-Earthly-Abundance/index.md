## The Rite of Belial's Earthly Abundance

**Purpose**: To invoke Belial as the guardian of the Earth element, manifesting wealth and diabolical abundance through dark forces.

**Preparation**:

- Timing: This ritual should be performed during the waxing moon, on a Saturday night, ideally at midnight to maximize alignment with the energies of Belial. If possible, perform it during the astrological sign of Capricorn for added power.

- Ritual space: Prepare a space outdoors or indoors with a connection to the Earth element (e.g., a cave, a room with an earthen floor, or a space with soil and plants). Cleanse the area using a broom, then burn sage or other purifying herbs to banish unwanted energies.

- Altar: Set up an altar facing North, the cardinal direction associated with the Earth element. Decorate it with objects symbolizing Earth, such as stones, crystals (particularly emerald, hematite, and obsidian), soil, or plants.

- Symbols and sigils: Draw Belial's sigil on a piece of parchment paper or etch it into a gold or obsidian disk. Surround the sigil with a circle of salt to symbolize the binding of Belial to the Earth. Prepare a chalice with red wine, symbolizing Belial's blood, and a plate containing an offering of soil, a gold coin, and fresh bread or cake made with earthy ingredients (such as nuts, seeds, or grains).

- Incense and candles: Burn patchouli or sandalwood incense, and light four green candles to represent Belial's power over the Earth element.

- Tools: Obtain an athame or ritual dagger (preferably made of iron), a divination tool like a pendulum or a scrying mirror, and a piece of parchment and ink for taking notes.

**Ritual**:

1. Begin the ritual by casting a circle around your ritual space. Call upon the four elemental powers, starting with Earth to the North, then Air to the East, Fire to the South, and Water to the West.

2. **Stand before the altar and chant the following invocation to awaken the energies of Belial**:

"Belial, mighty demon of the Earth,
I summon thee by the sigil that bears thy name,
I beseech thee to arise and be my guardian,
In this ritual of wealth and diabolical abundance,
Grant me thy guidance and protection,
As I bind thee to the power of the Earth,
Infernal lord, heed my call,
Manifest thy presence and make thyself known!"

3. **Take the athame or ritual dagger and trace the shape of Belial's sigil over the drawn or etched sigil on the altar while reciting this binding incantation**:

"Belial, powerful demon, bound to my will,
As I wield this blade and trace thy mark,
Submit and lend me thy control over Earth,
Guide the dark forces to manifest wealth,
Bind thyself to the element which you reign,
In this rite of abundance, may all be gained!"

4. **Offer the items on the plate to Belial while saying**:

"Belial, dark lord, I honor thee with an offering,
May this soil, coin, and nourishment please thee,
Accept it as a sign of my devotion,
In return, grant me the wealth and abundance I seek,
As the Earth provides, let so does thy diabolical power."

5. Drink from the chalice of wine, feeling its warmth and power fill you, and share a portion with the Earth as an offering to Belial.

6. Use the divination tool or scrying method of your choice to establish contact with Belial. Confirm his presence and the completion of the binding.

7. Ask Belial for guidance and assistance in manifesting wealth and abundance. Take notes of his messages on the parchment.

8. **When the working is complete, thank Belial for his presence and assistance. Release him by stating**:

"Belial, mighty demon of the Earth,
I release thee from this binding,
Go forth and fulfill the workings I have set before thee,
I release thee with gratitude and respect,
Hail Belial!"

9. Close the ritual by extinguishing the candles, snuffing out the incense, and releasing the elemental powers. Close the circle, ensuring to leave no traces behind.

10. In the days and weeks following the ritual, pay close attention to signs and synchronicities around you, and keep a record of your experiences â€“ they may hold the key to unlocking your desired wealth and abundance.

Remember that this rite harnesses potent dark energies and must be practiced with care and respect for the forces invoked. The practitioner must maintain control and assert their authority, always holding Belial to the task at hand and the completion of the given instructions. Be mindful of the consequences of such powerful dealings and proceed with caution.
