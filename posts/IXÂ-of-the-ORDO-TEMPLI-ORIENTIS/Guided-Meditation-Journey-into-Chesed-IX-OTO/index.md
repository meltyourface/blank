## Journey into Chesed - A Guided Meditation for IX° of the ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS

Introduction:
Welcome, fellow initiate of the IX° of the ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS. This guided meditation is designed to facilitate your journey into the mystical Sephirah of Chesed, the fourth emanation on the Tree of Life. We will encounter esoteric symbols, Qabalistic concepts, and evoke the guiding presence of the archangel Zadkiel. As we delve into the depths of Chesed and its energies of mercy and compassion, we shall expand our spiritual growth within the framework of Thelemic teachings. 

Preparation:
Sit or lie down in a comfortable position, ensuring you have enough room to move and breathe freely. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, grounding yourself in the present moment. As you inhale, visualize a radiant sphere of brilliant white light descending upon you, purifying and energizing your body and spirit. As you exhale, release any tensions or negative energies from within you.

Meditation:

1. Settling into the Sephirah of Chesed:
As your mind grows quiet, visualize yourself standing at the entrance to a great, ancient temple. This is the Temple of Chesed, where mercy, compassion, and loving-kindness abound. With each step you take into this sacred space, feel yourself becoming lighter, more open to receiving the wisdom and energies that Chesed offers.

2. Evoking the Archangel Zadkiel:
In the center of the Temple of Chesed, visualize a vast, glowing sphere of deep, azure blue light. This sphere is the manifestation of the archangel Zadkiel, a guiding presence within the realm of Chesed. Call upon Zadkiel with utmost reverence, saying:

"Zadkiel, great Archangel of Chesed, I humbly entreat your presence and guidance. Illuminate my path within the mysteries of Chesed. Enable me to embody the energies of mercy, compassion, and loving-kindness, as I walk the path of the IX° of the ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS. So mote it be."

3. Activation of the Tree of Life and Chesed:
As Zadkiel's radiant energy permeates the temple, visualize the Tree of Life with its intricate network of Sephirot and paths. Feel your consciousness ascending through the realms of Malkuth, Yesod, and into the gentle embrace of Chesed. The Temple becomes a microcosm of the Tree of Life, with the energies of all other Sephirah flowing in perfect harmony.

4. Exploration of Qabalistic Concepts:
Take a moment to meditate on the essence of Chesed and its Qabalistic correspondence - the number Four, which represents stability, structure, and the foundation upon which the universe is built. Ponder the Hermetic axiom, "As above, so below," and contemplate how the energy of Chesed permeates every aspect of existence.

5. Integration of Thelemic Teachings:
Allow yourself to be immersed in the wisdom and teachings of Thelema. Invoke the spirit of the Great Work, reminding yourself of your dedicated pursuit of self-realization and mastery within the ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS:

"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will. Let my every action be a reflection of the True Will, the guiding force of my spiritual path."

6. Cultivating Mercy, Compassion, and Empowerment:
As you bask in the energies of Chesed, feel a growing sense of empowerment, fueled by the lessons and experiences gained throughout your journey. Know that when you carry these energies within you, you radiate mercy, compassion, and loving-kindness to all those whom you encounter.

Closing:
As your meditation draws to a close, express your gratitude to the archangel Zadkiel for his guidance and wisdom. Begin to ground yourself in the present moment, breathing deeply as you bring awareness back to your physical body. When you feel ready, open your eyes, knowing that you have truly experienced the transformative power of the Sephirah of Chesed within your spiritual practice.
