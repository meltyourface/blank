In answering this knowledge challenge, we must first explore the esoteric principles of the four classical elements, understand the formation of Elemental prayers, and then determine how the consistent practice of these prayers leads to a deep symbiotic understanding with the fundamental forces of nature and spiritual growth.

The esoteric principles of the four classical elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) originate from ancient philosophies, most notably those of the Greeks, Egyptians, and Babylonians. Each element plays a crucial role in understanding the physical and metaphysical aspects of the world and ourselves:

1. Earth: This element symbolizes physicality, steadfastness, and materiality. In the esoteric traditions, Earth is the foundation of life, representing our tangible experiences and the physical plane of existence. 

2. Air: The element of Air represents intellect, communication, and mental capacity. It allows for the cultivation of ideas, stimulating the mind, and encouraging a rich environment for thought and expression. In the esoteric context, Air is often linked to the breath, which connects directly with life itself.

3. Fire: Fire symbolizes the transformative power of creation and destruction, embodying the concept of change and willpower. In many esoteric traditions, Fire is also associated with passion, energy, and the intangible force that ignites creativity and spiritual growth.

4. Water: As the fourth element, Water represents emotions, intuition, and the fluidity of life's experiences. Water is connected to the subconscious mind and is known for its cleansing and healing properties. In the esoteric world, Water is said to represent the deep reservoir of human potential and wisdom.

With these fundamental principles in mind, we can now comprehend how the four classical elements intertwine in the formation of Elemental prayers. These prayers are designed to communicate with and harness the energies of the respective elements, seeking their guidance, wisdom, and power. In doing so, practitioners delve into the very fabric of the natural world and their own spiritual essence, creating a harmonious blend of Earthly and ethereal energies.

For example, a person practicing Elemental prayers might begin with Earth, appealing for strength and stability in turbulent times. They might then seek guidance from Air, asking for the clarity of thought and the ability to communicate their needs effectively. Afterward, they might pray to Fire, requesting the transformative power and courage needed to change their circumstances and attain personal growth. Finally, they might turn to Water, seeking healing, emotional balance, and an intuitive understanding of their emotions and subconscious mind.

Through consistent practice of Elemental prayers, two primary outcomes emerge. First, a deeper symbiotic understanding with the fundamental forces of nature is attained. By communing with the elements regularly, practitioners form a profound connection with the natural world and develop a heightened sense of awareness to the subtle energetic interplay present in all things.

Second, spiritual growth ensues. As individuals continually engage with the elements, they foster archetypal qualities within themselves – strength from Earth, intellect from Air, transformative power from Fire, and emotional wisdom from Water. This process cultivates personal insights and wisdom, expanding one's spiritual capacities and connections to otherworldly energies.

In conclusion, the esoteric principles of the four classical elements – Earth, Air, Fire, and Water – underpin the foundation of Elemental prayers. By consistently practicing these prayers, individuals cultivate a symbiotic understanding with the fundamental forces of nature and promote their own spiritual growth. The result is a deepened connection to the natural world, an awakening to the interplay of energies, and the embracing of powerful archetypal qualities within themselves.
