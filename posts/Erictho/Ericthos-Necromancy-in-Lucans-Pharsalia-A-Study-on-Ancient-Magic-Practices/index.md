  Answer:
  
  To properly address the knowledge challenge and analyze the scene in Lucan's "Pharsalia" where Erictho reanimates a dead soldier, it's essential to first delve into the historical background of the text. "Pharsalia," also known as "De Bello Civili," is an epic poem written by the Roman poet Lucan in the first century. It chronicles the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great and serves as a critical source for information on ancient magic practices, particularly in the scene involving Erictho.
  
  Having established the background of the text, we can now examine the scene in question. Erictho is a witch and necromancer who is enlisted by Sextus, the son of Pompey, to foretell the outcome of the battle against Caesar. To achieve this, she raises the spirit of a dead soldier to reveal the future. In analyzing this scene and identifying three specific elements that demonstrate her position as a necromancer, we can establish the following:
  
  1. **Mastery over life and death**: A hallmark of necromancy, the ability to exert power over life and death, is exemplified in Erictho's actions. She defiles graves, tears apart corpses, and reanimates the dead to serve her purposes. The process of reanimation, which requires an intricate understanding of spirits and sorcery, reveals her as a formidable presence in the world of necromancy.
  
  2. **Relationship with the spirits and gods of the underworld**: For Erictho to summon the spirit of a dead soldier, she must first establish contact with the gods and spirits of the underworld. This demonstrates her ability to navigate the divine hierarchy, as well as her knowledge of appropriate rituals and offerings. Through these interactions, her exceptional status as a practitioner of the dark arts becomes evident.
  
  3. **Use of arcane rituals and symbols**: The scene demonstrates Erictho's use of complex rituals, sacrifices, and incantations to animate the corpse and compel the spirit to reveal its secrets. Lucan's descriptions of her unique spells and incantations highlight her mastery of necromantic techniques.
  
  Comparing these elements with other historical esoteric figures and necromantic practices, several points of divergence and similarity emerge. For example, Erictho's ability to reanimate the dead distinguishes her from other necromancers, who may have only been able to communicate with spirits or raise immaterial forms. Additionally, her unorthodox methods, which involve violating graves and disfiguring corpses, deviate from the standard practices of other contemporary Platonist or Neoplatonist traditions, where respect for the sanctity of graves was paramount.
  
  While certain aspects of her character and methods align with those of other necromantic figures in esotericism – such as the use of elaborate rituals, offerings, and communion with spirits – Erictho's sheer power and ruthlessness set her apart. Her malignant and antisocial nature challenges the typical "wise-woman" or "helpful magician" archetype, suggesting a more sinister representation of the necromantic tradition.
  
  To summarize, the scene in Lucan's "Pharsalia" highlights three specific elements of Erictho's character that indicate her position within the framework of ancient necromancy: her mastery over life and death, her relationship with the gods and spirits of the underworld, and her use of complex rituals and symbols. A comparison with other historical necromantic figures and practices reveals both shared elements and significant divergences, most notably in terms of her unorthodox methods and relentless pursuit of power.
