## I. **Introduction to Theistic Satanism and Luciferian Knowledge**:

1. **Pre-Christian and Pagan Roots (circa 500 BCE – 1 CE)**:

- Ancient societies such as Babylonians, Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks worshipped various gods and goddesses, some of which later became associated with Satan or the Devil in Abrahamic traditions.
- In the Roman Empire, the cult of Mithraism featured a god with similarities to the later concept of Lucifer. Mithraism was popular among soldiers and merchants, making it a potential influence on theistic Satanism and Luciferian practices.

2. **Christian Period (1 CE – 1400 CE)**:

- Development and persecution of Gnostic sects, such as the Cathars and Bogomils, who held dualistic beliefs in the struggle between good and evil, with Satan or Lucifer as a powerful entity.
- The rise of the concept of the Devil within Christianity, which was connected with older pagan beliefs and deities.

3. **Renaissance (circa 1300 – 1600 CE)**:

- A renewed interest in ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, mysticism, and the occult, which provided a foundation for the development of theistic Satanism and Luciferian Knowledge.
- The emergence of secret societies and intellectual circles, such as the Rosicrucians.

4. **Early Modern Period (1600 – 1800 CE)**:

- The witch trials and persecutions in Europe and the American colonies, which were fueled by the belief in the Devil, demonic pacts, and sorcery.
- The founding of Freemasonry, with its own rituals and symbolism that would later influence other secret societies and occult traditions.

5. The 19th Century (1800 – 1900 CE)

- Incorporation of Lucifer as a symbol of enlightenment by various figures such as Romantic poet William Blake and French occultist Eliphas Levi.
- Helena Blavatsky's Theosophical Society, which emphasized the development of spiritual wisdom and was an influence on later strains of theistic Satanism and Luciferian Knowledge.

6. **The 20th Century to Present (1900 CE – today)**:

- Aleister Crowley's development of the religion Thelema, which incorporates elements of ceremonial magic, occultism, and the worship of the deity Hadit. Crowley is also identified with the concept of the Beast 666 and influenced later Satanists and Luciferians.
- The founding of the Church of Satan (1966 CE) by Anton LaVey, which combined elements of the occult, philosophy, and psychology to form a new form of theistic Satanism.
- Michael Ford's creation of the Luciferian tradition (2003 CE) within the modern occult movement, emphasizing the pursuit of knowledge, personal transformation, and spiritual exploration in the service of the Adversary.
- Several significant schisms and branches within the tradition, such as the Temple of Set and the Church of Azazel, have evolved or enhanced the depths of Luciferian Wisdom.

7. Key Luciferian Figures, Sources, and Practices:

- In addition to the aforementioned figures, additional important figures in the development of Luciferianism include John Dee, Austin Osman Spare, Kenneth Grant, Charles Manson, and Peter J. Carroll.
- Primary sources for the study of Luciferianism include the writings of these figures, as well as foundational texts such as The Satanic Bible, The Compleat Witch, and the Luciferian Manifest.

In conclusion, the development of theistic Satanism and the foundation of Luciferian Knowledge is a complex and dynamic process that spans centuries of changing cultural and political contexts. Key events, figures, practices, and sects have all contributed to shaping the modern understanding of Satanism and the pursuit of esoteric wisdom.
