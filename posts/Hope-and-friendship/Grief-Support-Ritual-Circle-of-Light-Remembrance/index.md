## The Circle of Light and Remembrance

**Objective**: To uplift and console a grieving companion through the exploration of stages of grief and shared memories, interconnected with symbols and gestures illustrating unity, hope, and friendship.

Materials needed:
1. A comfortable, quiet space
2. Cushions or chairs for seating
3. Two candles (preferably white or any comforting color)
4. A small table or altar
5. A photo or cherished item of the lost friend
6. Tokens of friendship (e.g., bracelets or small gifts)
7. Pen and paper or other writing materials

**Participants**: Grieving companion, supportive friends, and/or loved ones

The Ritual:**Step 1**: Preparation
Create a safe and serene environment by arranging the seating in a circular formation. Place the table or altar at the center and lay the photo or cherished item upon it. Arrange the two candles beside the image.
**Step 2**: Initiation
The initiator lights the first candle, symbolizing the eternal bond of friendship. As they do so, they will say, "In the memory of [Lost Friend's Name], we light this candle to honor the love and friendship we shared." The group responds, "May this light guide us through the darkness."
**Step 3**: Empathetic Dialogue - Stages of Grief
Each participant takes turns sharing their emotions and experiences connected to each stage of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). The initiator encourages everyone to be honest and empathetic during the process. This step allows the grieving companion to realize they are not alone in their journey.
**Step 4**: Remembrance
Each participant shares a cherished memory that highlights the bond shared with the lost friend. The initiator writes these memories down, validating each recollection, and emphasizing the everlasting nature of these shared experiences.
**Step 5**: Lighting the Path
The initiator lights the second candle, symbolizing hope. They will say, "In honor of [Lost Friend's Name], we light this candle to represent the hope that shines within each of us." The group responds, "May this light guide us to healing."
**Step 6**: Exchange of Tokens
Participants exchange tokens of friendship between one another, reinforcing the connections that remain despite the loss. If desired, participants may contribute a token to place on the altar in commemoration of the departed friend.
**Step 7**: Closing the Circle
The group holds hands, forming a circle. The initiator leads the group in a final statement, "In unity and friendship, we remember [Lost Friend's Name] and find hope in our path forward. May our hearts be comforted by the love we now share and the memories that bind us." The group affirms, "The circle remains unbroken."

Encourage everyone to take time to embrace or exchange comforting words with one another. The Circle of Light and Remembrance symbolizes the everlasting nature of love and friendship, demonstrates the healing potential of shared memories and understanding, and sparks the flame of hope during a challenging time.
