  In the practice of Nocturnal spirit-flight, how does the synchronicity of the moon phases, the elements, and the practitioner's chosen symbolic anchors all intertwine to impact and enhance the astral journey, while taking into consideration the significance of liminal spaces and timing?

To provide a comprehensive response to this knowledge challenge, let's first break down the different components involved: Nocturnal spirit-flight (astral travel), synchronicity of moon phases, elements, symbolic anchors, liminality, and timing. We will then explore the relationship between these components and how they come together to impact and enhance the astral journey.

Nocturnal spirit-flight, also known as astral travel or astral projection, is a practice in the esoteric and occult fields, where the practitioner consciously enters an altered state of consciousness to separate their astral or subtle body from their physical body, in order to explore astral realms, gain insights, and communicate with various non-physical entities and energies. 

Moon Phases:
The moon has always held a significant place in the occult, esoteric, and magical practices. **The various phases of the moon represent different types of energy, which can be harnessed by the practitioner to enhance their spiritual work. The lunar cycle is divided into four primary phases**: New Moon, Waxing Moon, Full Moon, and Waning Moon.

1. **New Moon**: Represents new beginnings, initiation, and intention setting. This phase is ideal for beginning new spiritual practices or journeys.
2. **Waxing Moon**: Represents growth, expansion, and manifestation. This phase is helpful for building energy and focusing on personal development.
3. **Full Moon**: Represents power, culmination, and celebration. This phase is best for harnessing the peak energy of the lunar cycle and performing powerful rituals.
4. **Waning Moon**: Represents release, healing, and reflection. This phase is conducive to letting go of what no longer serves and focusing on inner healing.

Elements:
In many esoteric and occult traditions, the four elements (Earth, Water, Air, and Fire) are considered fundamental building blocks of reality, each with its unique qualities and attributes. By connecting with and harmonizing these elements within the practitioner themselves, they can create a balance that supports and enhances their astral journey.

Symbolic Anchors:
Symbolic anchors, also known as talismans, tokens, or fetishes, are physical objects that represent an idea, entity, or power. They act as a conduit for energy, facilitating the connection between the physical and astral realms. Practitioners typically use these anchors as a focal point for their intent, often incorporating them into rituals, meditations or carrying them during astral travel to maintain a strong connection to their physical body.

Liminal Spaces:
Liminal spaces are moments or locations of transition, existing between two states or worlds. This concept is integral to many occult and esoteric practices, as they represent the 'in-between,' which allows easier access to the astral realms. Examples of liminal spaces include doorways, twilight, and the boundary between sleeping and waking states.

Timing:
Timing is crucial in esoteric and occult practices, as it is believed that specific times, dates, and astrological alignments can have a considerable impact on the outcome of rituals and practices. As such, practitioners often choose to perform their astral journeys during specific lunar phases, planetary alignments, or hours of the day/night that are most conducive to success.

Now that we have broken down these components, let's explore how they intertwine to impact and enhance the astral journey in Nocturnal spirit-flight.

1. **Synchronicity of Moon Phases and Elements**: By synchronizing the practitioner's activities with the right moon phase and the qualities of the elements, they can harness the optimal energy for their desired outcome. For example, if a practitioner wishes to strengthen their astral body, they might choose to work during a waxing moon (growth energy) and focus on the fire element (energy and vitality).

2. **Symbolic Anchors and Liminal Spaces**: The combined power of symbolic anchors and liminal spaces allows the practitioner to create a potent portal between the physical and astral worlds. This can be achieved by placing or carrying the anchor in a liminal space, thereby strengthening the connection between the two realms and aiding in their astral journey.

3. **Timing and Astral Journey**: The proper timing of an astral journey, in alignment with the lunar cycle, the elements, and symbolic anchors, creates an energetic atmosphere that enhances the practitioner's ability to access the astral realms and achieve their desired results.

To summarize, the synchronicity of moon phases, the elements, and the practitioner's chosen symbolic anchors play a significant role in impacting and enhancing the astral journey in Nocturnal spirit-flight practice. When combined with the understanding of liminal spaces and proper timing, this creates a powerful synergy that aids the practitioner in successfully navigating the astral realms, while acquiring deep insights and understanding in the process. This intricate web of synchronicity and alignment serves as a potent reminder of the interconnected nature of reality and the importance of harmonizing our practices with the natural world around us.
