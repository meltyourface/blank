As a text-based AI, I am unable to compose an actual symphonic masterpiece. However, I can provide you with an outline for creating a Gothic symphony that is rich in themes and atmosphere derived from the esoteric, supernatural, and dark beauty of Gothic culture.

Title: Symphony of Lamenting Shadows

### I. Awakening of the Vampyre (Allegro Misterioso)

The symphony begins with haunting melodies played by violin and cello, hinting at foreboding darkness that looms in the shadows. Then, the deep reverberation of the pipe organ introduces an ancient vampyre who awakens from a centuries-long slumber. Harpsichord and flute weaving in and out of the orchestrations evoke images of cobwebs and eerie winds. The main themes are about unrequited love and the inevitable passage of time.

### II. Romance by the Moonlit Grave (Adagio Espressivo)

A dark romantic movement that explores the theme of love lost through the passage of times represented by the melancholic strings playing a love theme. The harpsichord, with its soft and delicate tonality, evokes images of Victorian lace, while the lamenting trumpet solo tells a story of longing, desire, and bitter memories. In this movement, the ghostly presence of unrequited love is palpable amidst the shadowy landscape.

### III. The Dance of the Damned (Scherzo Maligno)

This scherzo movement represents a twisted and macabre dance, featuring strikingly rhythmic and ominous melodies from the string section, enhanced by subtle backing from timpani and pipe organ. The theme explores the seductive allure of darkness and its hold on the human psyche, as the damned congregate in a ballroom lit only by flickering candlelight. The Gothic influence beings the eternal night, as creatures long-hidden from the world of the living take their place on the dance floor.

### IV. Requiem for the Fallen (Largo Funerale)

The final movement is a somber requiem filled with the echoes of the past, as the full orchestra plays a funeral procession with mourning melodies. The pipe organ, once again, establishes a grandiose and solemn atmosphere, as the symphony reaches its climax, and a solo violin weaves a heart-wrenching requiem for the lost souls. The movement concludes with glimpses of hope and redemption, as a ray of moonlight pierces through the darkness, offering a faint glimmer of peace amongst the shadows.

By following this outline, one could create a symphonic masterpiece that evokes the Gothic realm's ethereal essence, resonating with listeners through haunting melodies, chilling orchestration, and deeply moving themes.
