Welcome, esteemed guests, to the forlorn halls of Castle Shadowsbane, where once great banquets enthralled the court, now fallen into the embrace of darkness and decay. Lit by the ghostly glow of candles flickering in the shadowy corners, feel the chill of thorny ivy creep up the crumbling walls and witness as the Gothic tapestries seem to come to life as if haunted by their own tales. Tonight, we invite you to indulge in a feast as haunting as the castle's history; a banquet wherein every morsel whispers of otherworldly delights designed to tantalize your senses and awaken the gothic soul within each of you. Journey with us through each morose course as it appears, draped in creeping mist and echoing with ethereal whispers.

Appetizers of Eldritch Splendor:
1. Stuffed Banshee Lament Mushrooms - Tender fungi plucked from the graves of sorrowful spirits, filled with a spectral blend of melted moon cheese, ghostly chills, and garnished with a touch of shredded werewolf thistle.
2. Abyssal Caviar - Served atop Poltergeist Bellinis, this fearful darkness-infused roe sourced from the Nether Sea serpents whisper sinister secrets each time the velvety orbs burst against your mortal tongue.

Eerie Entr√©es:
1. Blood Moon Risotto - A delectable crimson masterpiece, crafted from the sin-soaked tears of fallen angels weeping over forbidden love, blended meticulously with saffron strands handpicked under the muted glow of the blood moon, and infused with the ashes of immolated phoenix feathers.
2. Bansidhe Venison - Roasted slowly over embers of cursed elm and juniper from the fabled Darkwood Forest, every ounce of this luscious game soaked in the macabre essence of haunting banshee wails that float on the midnight breeze.
3. Hecate's Bounty - A somber medley of bewitched, root-bound vegetables grown in the scorched soils of the Witch Queen's secret garden, each tender bite seasoned with enchanted herbs and sear-kissed by the flame of a dragon's breath.

Dark Desserts:
1. Dolci della Nera Luna - A dessert as black as the Darkest Night, consisting of a medley of inky confections, including cobweb fudge, raven's breath mousse, and shadow sorbet, that meld together to form a whispered aria of the abyss.
2. Ectoplasmic Eclairs - These delicate pastries take their unnatural, unearthly glow from the ethereal ectoplasm milking from restless spirits who imbue each sumptuously filled confection with a hint of the great beyond.

A Toxical Tincture - The Finale:
1. Elixir of the Ebon Hour - To end this macabre feast, partake in a goblet of this bone-chilling and potent elixir, brewed with the essence of midnight plucked from the ebon wings of a spectral raven. Feel the heaviness of the potion settle into your very marrow, locking an eternal bond with the clandestine worlds unseen by mortal eyes.

We have no doubt that, once tasted, this Gothic-inspired banquet with its menagerie of supernatural ingredients and haunting preparation methods shall haunt your dreams for eternity. Hail the night, dear guest, and let the darkness consume you in its intoxicating embrace.
