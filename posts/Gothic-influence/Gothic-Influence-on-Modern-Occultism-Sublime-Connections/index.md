In order to meticulously analyze the impact of Gothic architecture and literature on the development of the modern occult tradition, we must first delve into the historical and artistic context of the Gothic movement, which spanned from the 12th to the 16th century in Europe, particularly focusing on its architectural and literary components. We will then examine the notion of the "sublime," as well as the emerging idea of an "occult sublime" as it is understood within the Gothic context and by key representatives, including Victor Hugo, Anton LaVey, Aleister Crowley, and Edgar Allan Poe. With these foundations firmly established, we will explore their connection to the modern occult tradition. 

The Gothic architectural movement, characterized by its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and intricate ornamentation, represented a significant departure from its predecessor, the Romanesque style. This artistic upheaval allowed architects to create soaring spaces flooded with light, inducing an overwhelming sense of awe and grandeur that evoked the presence of the divine. The Gothic style was driven by a renewed emphasis on spirituality, as it took hold primarily in the construction of churches and cathedrals – buildings intended to inspire individuals to contemplate the mysteries of the universe and their place within it. 

On the other hand, Gothic literature, born in the 18th century, often dealt with supernatural and macabre themes, reflecting the psychological and moral complexities of its protagonists as they navigated crumbling castles, haunted abbeys, and mysterious landscapes. Notable authors of this genre include Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, and Ann Radcliffe, among others. Both Gothic architecture and literature played a role in shaping the concept of the "sublime," which referred to the emotional response evoked by overwhelming, awe-inspiring, and potentially terrifying encounters with natural or human-made phenomena. 

As we turn to key representatives leading the development of modern occultism, we see the influences of the Gothic movement manifest in their works, ideologies, and personal lives. Victor Hugo, a French writer and poet, was entrenched in the Gothic revival. His work "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" can be considered as a tribute to Gothic architecture, particularly the titular cathedral itself. This novel also explores themes of darkness, passion, and yearning, emblematic of the Gothic literary tradition. By applying these themes within a medieval cathedral, Hugo inadvertently contributed to the growing concept of an "occult sublime" – a blend of awe and transcendence based on a hidden or secret knowledge.

Similar connections to the occult sublime can be traced in the works and beliefs of Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan. His Satanic Bible reflects the eclectic nature of Gothic literature by combining elements of magic and mysticism, dark romanticism, and transgressive ideas. LaVey’s embrace of pleasure, individuality, and a theatrical sense of aesthetics demonstrated the ongoing intertwining of the Gothic and the occult.

Aleister Crowley, an English occultist, mystic and poet, is considered one of the most iconic figures in modern occultism. While not directly associated with the Gothic movement, Crowley's work on the esoteric order called Thelema drew from the sense of the sublime. His provocative ideas and aesthetics bear a resemblance to the darker aspects of Gothic literature, with their fascination with mystery and magic.

Finally, Edgar Allan Poe, a master of the macabre, expertly navigated the emotional landscape of fear, suspense, and the supernatural within his stories and poetry. His exploration of the psychological and emotional spaces in which humans grapple with overwhelming experiences aligns with the notion of the sublime, subtly infusing his work with the flavor of an emerging occult sublime.

In summary, Gothic architecture and literature, through their unique ability to evoke powerful emotions and deep introspection, played a vital role in shaping the development of modern occult tradition. By examining the works and ideologies of key figures like Victor Hugo, Anton LaVey, Aleister Crowley, and Edgar Allan Poe, we can trace the evolving concept of an "occult sublime," which unites these seemingly disparate realms of influence. This occult sublime can be seen as an aesthetic, intellectual, and emotional bridge connecting the Gothic and the occult, resulting in a rich tapestry of ideas that continue to influence and inspire occult movements and practitioners to this day.
