All of the above

The realm of allegory and the occult is prominent in several literary works, with some of the most notable being The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, Paradise Lost by John Milton, and The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. All of these works utilize esoteric symbolism to convey deeper, hidden meanings that allow readers to undergo profound transformations in their understanding of the world.

The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri explores the journey of the poet through the realms of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. This allegorical work is filled with symbolism and hidden meanings that speak to the nature of sin, redemption, and the quest for divine understanding. One key symbol is the number three, which is a sacred number in the Christian faith and associated with the Holy Trinity. The Divine Comedy itself is divided into three parts, with each part consisting of thirty-three cantos, further emphasizing the importance of this number.

Paradise Lost by John Milton is an epic poem that covers the biblical story of the Fall of Man, dealing with the rebellion of Satan and the eventual expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Through the story, Milton explores themes of free will, divinity, and the perils of temptation. The poem is filled with allegories and esoteric symbolism, with the character of Satan himself embodying these traits. In Satan's rebellion against God, we see the dangerous allure of knowledge and the beauty that can exist within evil. The poem also uses numerological symbolism, with many instances of the number nine, a number often associated with the fall of mankind and the tribulations that come with it.

The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho tells the story of a young shepherd named Santiago who embarks on a journey to fulfill his Personal Legend, which is the realization of his dreams and ambitions. Throughout the story, Santiago encounters various characters and symbols that serve as allegorical guidance for him on his journey. The book is imbued with esoteric and occult symbolism that encourages readers to search for their own Personal Legends - that is, their true destinies - and to embrace their personal journeys of spiritual enlightenment, addressing perennial human questions related to the meaning of life, fate, and the power of the human spirit.

In conclusion, all three of these works - The Divine Comedy, Paradise Lost, and The Alchemist - utilize allegory and esoteric symbolism to convey deeper, hidden meanings. Readers who engage with these texts will find themselves transformed in their understanding of the world and their place within it, as they learn about the intricate and often obscure relationships between sin and redemption, free will and divine intervention, and personal ambition and spiritual enlightenment. These texts serve as invaluable gateways to the exploration of the human condition, as well as the mysteries and complexities of the esoteric and occult realms.
