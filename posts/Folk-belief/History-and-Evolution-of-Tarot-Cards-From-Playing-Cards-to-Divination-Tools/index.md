  The origins of tarot cards can be traced back to the 15th century in Europe when they were primarily used for playing games. Known as tarocchi in Italy, tarot cards have their roots in the traditional card games such as triumphs or trionfi, from which the modern game of taroc took its name. The cards were initially unconnected to the occult and mystical practice they are known for today.
  
  It was during the 18th century that tarot cards transitioned from being recreational possessions to divination tools. In France, Antoine Court de GÃ©belin, a noted Freemason and esotericist, became enthralled by tarot cards. He believed that the symbolism in the cards was influenced by Egyptian spirituality and proceeded to write a series of essays that related tarot symbolism to Egyptian mysticism. Consequently, the occult tarot was born, and the connection between tarot cards and divination practices solidified.
  
  Over the centuries, tarot decks have varied regionally and stylistically, with Italian, French, and Swiss decks differing in artistic presentation and the number of cards. One of the most famous early versions of tarot decks is the Visconti-Sforza, created around the mid-15th century for the ruling family in Milan. Another well-known deck is the Tarot de Marseille, which became the standard across many European territories in the 16th and 17th centuries. It had strong symbols that became the basis for the design of modern tarot decks.
  
  Emphasis on the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, created in 1909, is essential. Designed by occultist A. E. Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, it became an influential deck that combined elements from various tarot traditions. The cards' depictions were more detailed and focused on esoteric symbolism, which helped make the meanings and interpretations more accessible.
  
  Throughout history, interpretations of tarot card symbolism have evolved by blending diverse religious, mystical, and cultural perspectives. For instance, Christian, Jewish, and pagan mythologies all influenced the Major Arcana. The tarot card meanings have often been viewed through the lens of the society in which they were popular, with some societies focusing on moral themes, while others prioritized astrology, alchemy, or kabalist influences.
  
  Occultist movements and esoteric societies played critical roles in the popularization of tarot card reading. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a prominent secret society in late 19th-century England, incorporated tarot reading into its teachings and practices. Through influential members like Arthur Edward Waite, Pamela Colman Smith, and Aleister Crowley, the popularity and mystical reverence for tarot cards continued to grow. Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck is another vital deck in tarot history, as it has its unique symbolism and interpretations stemming from his deep interest in the occult.
  
  The artistic styles in tarot cards have been hugely impacted by social norms and political climates, ranging from medieval and renaissance to modern and abstract styles. Additionally, the cards have not only reflected the societal changes, but they have also served as a means to preserve and transmit cultural knowledge and values.
  
  In conclusion, the history of tarot cards is rich and multifaceted, shaping the evolution of esotericism, spirituality, and human creativity. From their beginnings as playing cards to their current status as symbolic tools for divination, tarot cards continue to captivate those interested in the occult and mystical. Their progression is a testament to the enduring appeal of the esoteric and the power of symbolism in human societies.
