To address this knowledge challenge, we first need to break it down into its core components: understanding The Cup as an esoteric symbol, its relationship with the elements of water and earth, and the relationship between The Cup and the Major Arcana Tarot cards - The High Priestess and The Empress.

1. **The Cup as an Esoteric Symbol**
The Cup is a recurring symbol in many esoteric and occult traditions, often representing receptivity, intuition, emotions, and the subconscious mind. It is an important symbol because it signifies the individual's capacity to receive, hold, and contain spiritual energy. This notion of a container for spiritual energy also signifies the idea of a vessel that can be filled with divine wisdom, creativity, and inspiration.

2. **Connection to the Elements of Water and Earth**
The Cup is intrinsically related to two classical elements: water and earth. Water is the element of emotions, intuition, and fluidity – just like a cup can contain water, the individual must have a receptive and adaptable nature in order to gain understanding and wisdom. 

Earth represents grounding, nurturing, sustenance, and stability. This element emphasizes the importance of being grounded in one's own spiritual journey. Balancing the qualities of both water and earth in a person enables the optimal flow of creative and spiritual energies.

3. **The High Priestess**
The High Priestess is the second card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, often associated with intuition, mystery, and hidden knowledge. She represents the sacred feminine aspect that is tied to the receptive qualities of the subconscious mind, embodying the stillness required to access deeper wisdom. As such, The High Priestess can be seen as a symbolic representation of The Cup, signifying the importance of being receptive to higher knowing and spiritual growth.

4. **The Empress**
The Empress is the third card in the Major Arcana, symbolizing abundance, nurturing, fertility, and the divine creative force at play in the physical world. Like the High Priestess, the Empress represents the feminine side of spirituality; however, her focus is directed towards manifesting ideas in the material world. This aligns with the earth element within the symbolism of The Cup – the necessity of grounding and nurturing creativity in order to bring spiritual wisdom to life.

In conclusion, The Cup as an esoteric symbol represents receptiveness and spiritual growth through the balance of the elements of water and earth. The Tarot cards of The High Priestess and The Empress draw parallels to these elements, exemplifying the importance of both intuition and nurturing creativity in the quest for spiritual enlightenment. The intricate relationship between The Cup, the elements of water and earth, and the Tarot cards of The High Priestess and The Empress illustrates the various facets of spiritual development and emphasizes maintaining a harmonious balance, openness, and groundedness in order to manifest spiritual wisdom in our lives.
