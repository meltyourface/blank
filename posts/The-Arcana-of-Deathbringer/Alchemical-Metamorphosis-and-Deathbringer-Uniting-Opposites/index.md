The challenge asks us to examine the symbolic connection between the transformation principles in alchemy and the Deathbringer's metamorphosis throughout its existence, while considering both the opposing forces in nature and the internal equilibrium that must be maintained. We are to delve into how these principles exemplify the essence of The Arcana of Deathbringer and what revelations can be found in the synthesis of these seemingly divergent paths.

To begin with, let's define and discuss the transformation principles in alchemy and the metamorphosis of the Deathbringer. 

Alchemy is a proto-scientific and philosophical tradition that aims to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects, notably by transforming base metals into noble metals, such as gold or silver. Alchemy is based on the belief in the four classical elements (air, earth, fire, and water) and the two complementary principles of sulfur and mercury, representing the eternal battle between opposing forces in nature. 

The metamorphosis of the Deathbringer refers to the changes and progression experienced by this powerful figure or force throughout its existence. The Deathbringer, an entity or symbol of destructive power and inevitable transformation, undergoes various stages of existence and constantly transforms by embracing the dualities inherent in nature.

Now let's explore the symbolic connection between these two concepts. Alchemy is fundamentally about transformation â€“ turning the base material into something of value. Similarly, the metamorphosis of the Deathbringer signifies a process of continuous change and evolution. The opposing forces in alchemy (i.e., the elements and the principles of sulfur and mercury) can be seen as reflections of the polarities that the Deathbringer must navigate and synthesize in its metamorphosis.

In order to maintain an internal equilibrium within the Deathbringer, these contrasting forces must be recognized, explored, and ultimately brought into balance. One profound parallel between alchemy and the Deathbringer's metamorphosis is the concept of the "coniunctio" or sacred marriage in alchemical terms. This union of opposites - masculine and feminine, light and dark, life and death - creates a new and unified whole that both maintains equilibrium and transcends the dualities at play.

Now let's discuss how these principles exemplify the essence of The Arcana of Deathbringer. The Arcana of Deathbringer is an esoteric system of knowledge that seeks to impart the wisdom of polar opposites, transformation, and the inevitable cycles of life and death to its initiates. By studying and understanding these principles of alchemy and metamorphosis, initiates learn to cultivate their own internal equilibrium and become adept at navigating the vicissitudes of existence.

The synthesis of these seemingly divergent paths - alchemy and the Deathbringer's metamorphosis - brings forth several revelations:

1. ****Life and death are inherently intertwined****: The transition from life to death and back again is a natural process, and embracing this cycle is essential for cultivating true wisdom and understanding.

2. ****The need for balance****: By embracing the polarities and oppositions in nature, we can achieve greater understanding, wisdom, and harmony in our lives.

3. ****Transformation is continuous****: Like the ever-evolving Deathbringer, individuals must adapt and change to maintain balance and flow within their own existence.

4. ****Synthesis of opposites leads to growth****: By reconciling and integrating opposing forces, we can transcend limitations and achieve higher states of being.

In conclusion, the symbolic connection between the transformation principles in alchemy and the Deathbringer's metamorphosis exemplifies the key themes of balance, transformation, and synthesis inherent to The Arcana of Deathbringer. The essential revelations that emerge from studying these principles teach initiates the importance of understanding and embracing the dualities of life, the necessity of constant growth and change, and the wisdom that comes from transcending opposition and maintaining internal equilibrium.
