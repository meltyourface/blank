I

Upon the hearth of ancient fire,
Where suns and stars themselves inspire,
A sacred dance, a primal tale,
Of six divine, their powers regale.

The Empyream Flame, their kinship binds,
Unto their realm, no mortal finds,
Woven in cosmic tapestry,
An endless song of unity.

II

First, Radios, lord of ember gleam,
Whose burning heart does brighten dream,
His fiery mane bestrides the night,
Awake the shadows from their flight.

In warmth and hope, his influence felt,
A golden sun upheld, unbelt,
In whispers soft, of Radios' light,
Resides the brilliance of his might.

III

Next, Solaris, who guardeth day,
With astral spear, ye shadows flay,
And keep the ebon darkness sparse,
Upon his steed, with starry ars.

His burning gaze, a beacon warm,
Doth guide the hearts, through storms transform,
Ever-present, e'er steadfast,
Solaris stands as solid mast.

IV

Yet soft, the gentle flare of Luna,
She who maintains both high and nether,
The tides of time obey her grace,
Her silvern glow, the night embrace.

In Luna's light, do secrets lie,
Of hidden truths she doth untie,
Weaving dusk and dawn as one,
Her cosmic thread hath ne'er undone.

V

Celeste, imbued with cosmic dance,
Within her embers, life's romance,
A flame of passion fuels desire,
As kindling hearts transform in fire.

She flows within each living breath,
As eons hum a tune unmet,
Her undying pulse, a strain surreal,
Ignites the pathways of the ethereal.

VI

And next, the currents of Astrala,
Who weaves connections that shan't unravel,
Connecting fates, aligning stars,
Her sacred nexus spans afar.

Her unseen strings the heavens sway,
As celestial bodies obey,
Unfurling fates intrinsically,
Astrala's web enshrouds mystically.

VII

Lastly, Atarax, keeper of serene,
Who calms the fire in realms unseen,
As chaos seethes within the blaze,
His gentle touch restores lost phase.

His silent presence heals the bane,
Quenching the ardor's fervent strain,
Thus, Atarax, in balance be,
A bastion firm, unwavering tree.

VIII

Oh, praise unto these six divine,
Whose cosmic threads forever twine,
The Empyream Flame unfeigned,
Their unity transcends, unrestrained.

Each deity embodies grace,
Within the flame, they find solace,
An ethereal tale embellished by time,
These six immortal, radiant, prime.
