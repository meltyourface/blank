The connection between Sleipnir and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess, as a reflection of a shared European mythological legacy.

In examining the possible connections between Odin's eight-legged horse, Sleipnir, and a non-Norse cultural counterpart, the relationship between Sleipnir and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess, is particularly compelling. This is due to the shared European mythological context, where both tales, symbols, and deities were likely to influence neighboring cultures. 

From a historical perspective, both the Norse and Celtic cultures coexisted within similar timelines and geographies, with populations of Celtic and Norse people living in close proximity in various regions of Europe, including the British Isles and mainland Europe. As a result, cultural exchanges between these groups were highly probable, with beliefs and mythological constructs filtering between communities. This cultural diffusion could have led to the development of Sleipnir being influenced by Epona or vice versa.

While the Zoroastrian connection would be fascinating from a universal symbolism perspective, this Persian-origin belief system is less likely to have had significant contact with the Norse culture due to its more eastern geographical origins. Similarly, Hindu and Buddhist traditions also pose intriguing links, but these belief systems were geographically concentrated in South Asia, making them far less likely candidates for directly influencing or being influenced by Norse mythology.

The similarities between Epona and Sleipnir are also notable. Both are horse figures associated with powerful divinities and exhibit exceptional abilities. Epona was widely revered as a protector of horses, their riders, and stable hands, denoting a similar functionality as Sleipnir - the mount of Odin, the chief god in Norse mythology. Additionally, both figures are associated with travel and journeys, further illustrating their connective potential.

In conclusion, by analyzing the historical context, geographical proximity and similarity of the tales and symbolism involving the two horse deities, the most plausible link between Sleipnir and a non-Norse counterpart is found in Epona, the Celtic horse goddess. This demonstrates the potential of shared mythological legacies throughout the interconnected communities of European cultures that may have influenced each other during their development and evolution.
