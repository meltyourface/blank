Answer: Symbolizing mastery over the boundaries between realms

Explanation and Lesson:
In the context of the Re-interpretation of Sleipnir, Sleipnir - Odin's eight-legged horse, serves as a symbol of mastery over the boundaries between realms. This connection to the deeper occult and esoteric implications of the myth reveals how Sleipnir is not merely an animal companion but exemplifies a fundamental aspect of the occult and mysticism. 

The eight legs of Sleipnir have a notable significance in Nordic mythology. **They are believed to represent the eight main directions**: north, east, south, west, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. In this context, Sleipnir effectively connects, unifies, and transports Odin across different realms and dimensions. This mastery is particularly significant in the esoteric and occult world, as crossing these boundaries represents the ultimate goal of spiritual growth and transformation.

Sleipnir's role in symbolizing mastery over the boundaries between realms is also evident in its frequent depiction when traveling with Odin. **These myths often portray Odin journeying through the nine realms in Norse cosmology**: Asgard, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Midgard, Jotunheim, Svartalfheim, Nidavellir, Niflheim, and Muspelheim.

When examining the Re-interpretation of Sleipnir and its modern significance, it's important to consider the historical context for this symbolism. In ancient Norse society, the image of a horse held significant spiritual importance. Horses were believed to possess an innate ability to traverse between different worlds and communicate with deities, spirits, and other supernatural beings. This belief in the horse's spiritual power aligns with Sleipnir's role as a bridge between different realms.

Additionally, Sleipnir's connection to the boundary between realms is relevant in the modern occult context of psychopomp figures, guides, and spirits that help souls navigate the afterlife and transition between planes of existence. This connection demonstrates Sleipnir's continued role in contemporary esoteric and occult practices.

In summary, the key element of Sleipnir's modern significance that connects to the deeper occult and esoteric implications of the myth is its symbolism of mastery over the boundaries between realms. This concept is particularly poignant in Norse mythology, historical context, and modern occult practices. Moreover, it highlights the importance of spiritual growth and transformation in the pursuit of esoteric knowledge.
