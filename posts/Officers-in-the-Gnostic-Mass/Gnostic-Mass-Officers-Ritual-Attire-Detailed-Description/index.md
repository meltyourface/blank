1. **Priest**:
Robe: The Priest's robe is an intricately embroidered, floor-length garment made of deep red velvet. The robe symbolizes authority and passion. It has long, flowing sleeves with golden linings, signifying nobility and spiritual power.

Emblems/Embroideries: The robe features intricate gold embroideries of the Eye of Horus on the chest and solar symbols that represent the Sun (i.e., the Solar Cross). The lower hem is adorned with serpents and intertwined roses, signifying the integration of dualities and the path of enlightenment.

**Accessories**: A stole made of red silk with gold fringes is worn over the robe, with the Priest's corresponding magical glyphs hand-stitched on both sides. He also wears a golden crown or headpiece that incorporates the symbol of the Ankh and a lapis lazuli gemstone, embodying both eternal life and wisdom.

2. **Priestess**:
Robe: The Priestess's robe is an elegant, floor-length gown made of shimmering blue silk, signifying the Divine Feminine, the night sky, and the mysteries of the moon. The gown has long, draped sleeves, and silver linings, representing lunar light and intuition.

Emblems/Embroideries: The gown is adorned with embroidered silver crescent moons, stars, and images of goddesses on the chest and sleeves. The lower hem features waves and chalice symbols, symbolizing the connection to water and mysteries of the subconscious.

**Accessories**: To complement the gown, the Priestess wears a stole made of blue silk with silver fringes and corresponding magical glyphs. She also wears a silver tiara or diadem featuring the Triple Moon symbol, alongside pearls and sapphires to represent the nurturing and intuitive aspects of her role.

3. **Deacon**:
Robe: The Deacon's robe is a floor-length garment made of rich, vibrant yellow silk. Yellow is the color of intellect, knowledge, and communication. It has moderately wide sleeves with green linings, signifying the harmonizing powers of the Deacon.

Emblems/Embroideries: The robe features gold embroideries of the Caduceus, symbolizing the balance between opposing forces and the transformative power of spiritual work. There are also intricate emblems of eagle wings for the element of Air, relating to the intellect and the role of communication.

4. **Two Children**:
Robe: The robes for the two Children are made of white linen, signifying purity and innocence. For the Child with the Sword, a red sash represents active energy, while for the Child with the Cup, a blue sash signifies receptive energy. Both robes have simple yet elegant gold linings.
