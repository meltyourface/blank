description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Syncretic rite, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose an invocatory prayer or mantra for a Syncretic rite, amalgamating attributes from at least three distinct deities originating from diverse cultural pantheons. Ensure the prayer or mantra adeptly honors these divine figures by weaving their mythological narratives and sacred symbols into the text, while maintaining the profound and esoteric nature of the invocation. Additionally, address how the amalgamated deities work in harmony to offer specific blessings or protections in the realm of the Syncretic rite.

I invoke the union of the divine trinity: Nyx, the Greek goddess of the night; Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of wind, wisdom, and creation; and Anubis, the Egyptian god of death and the afterlife. In this sacred and syncretic confluence, I place my faith and seek their protection, wisdom, and guidance.

Nyx, who births the darkness and dances in its depths;
Quetzalcoatl, the plum√®d serpent who weaves and breathes life's breath;
Anubis, the Guide of Souls and Guardian of the weighing scales.

Three spirits bound by their cosmic ties, resplendent in their constellations, behold our plea:
Blend thy currents, meld thy essences, and purify our inner soul.

As the cloak of Nyx enshrouds our mortal selves, may we commune with the depths unknown,
So too, may the whispers of Quetzalcoatl, the bringer of knowledge, empower our hearts and minds,
Finally, as Anubis, protector of the dead, weighs our deeds and lighter than the feather, may his guidance lead us to transcendence.

Oh divine Syncretic Rite, we call thee, 
By the shadows of night, the breath of Quetzalcoatl, and the passage of souls.

Divinely unified, your powers of darkness, wind, and afterlife entwine,
To bestow upon us clarity, wisdom, and impartiality, in trials of our time.

Deep as Nyx's journey, spanned over celestial seas,
Is our gratitude for this sacred weaving, of the trinity's decree.

By the light of the moon and serpents' flight,
With jackal's wisdom and night's embrace,
May we traverse the path less traveled, unearthing the layers of truth and grace.

In the name of the united Syncretic Rite, we seek thy guidance and protection,
Bless our every step, enlighten our spirits, and transform our intentions.

So mote it be.
