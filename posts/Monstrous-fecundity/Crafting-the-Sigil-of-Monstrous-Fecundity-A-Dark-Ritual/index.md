To craft the potent sigil of Monstrous fecundity, a meticulous process must be followed, taking every aspect into consideration. By combining the amplifying powers of fertility with the unhallowed union of otherworldly creatures, a powerful sigil will come to life. 

Begin by acquiring a parchment made from the pitch-black hide of a chthonic creature – perhaps the Nether Scourge that roams the depths of the underworld, for its skin is both robust and steeped in malevolent energy. This surface will perfectly fuse with the dark arts at play.

Start the sigil design by painting the spiraling horns of a mythical beast, such as the alicorn of a Nightshade Alicanto – the essence of this horned creature will evoke a strong foundation for the sigil. Use a brush crafted from the quills of a Lunar-Moth, dipped in ink mixed with blood from a fertile Nightshade Alicanto. This will allow the brush to glide effortlessly, creating a compelling design on the parchment.

Next, intricately draw the coiling tail of a serpentine entity. The tailbone of a Leviathan Dragon works best, as its chimeric nature will add a potent force to the sigil. Depict each scale and coil in great detail, intertwining it with the spiraling horns to symbolize the fusion of their energies.

Incorporate the engorged roots of a forbidden flora, such as the Infernal Bloodroot tree. The roots should pierce through the soil like tendrils, ensconced within the very essence of life and fertility. Weave these roots around the serpentine tail and spiraling horns, further amplifying the interconnected powers of each element.

Once the sigil is complete, imbue it with eldritch energy. Light a taper made from the tallow of an abyssal chimera, and let the slow, crimson wax drip onto the surface of the sigil. As the wax pools and cools, chant the ancient incantations – those that echo with the voices of beings long forgotten – to instill the sigil's mesmerizing power.

Lastly, carefully wrap the sigil in cloth woven from the silk of the Shadow Widow's web. This will protect the sigil from prying eyes and preserve its malicious energy.

With every element in place, the Monstrous fecundity sigil will be a powerful tool capable of ensnaring the minds of those who gaze upon it, amplifying fertility, and invoking the unhallowed union of otherworldly creatures.
