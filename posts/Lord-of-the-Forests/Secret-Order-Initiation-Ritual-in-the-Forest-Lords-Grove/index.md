## Initiation Ceremony into the Secret Order of the Forest Lords

### I. Preparation
A. Sacred Grove
1. ****Location****: Deep within the ancient and secluded Gladerend Forest. The sacred grove is marked by a circle of nine towering oak trees, each adorned with emerald moss and ivy.
2. ****Secret Path****: The path to the grove is veiled by natural illusion, known only to the initiates and requires the use of a lodestone etched with the Forest Lords' sigil to navigate successfully.

B. Lunar Phase Requirements
1. ****Timing****: The ceremony must take place during the Waxing Gibbous Moon, symbolizing growth and the gaining of power from the woodland spirits.
2. ****Moonrise****: The initiation begins at the exact moment the moon crests above the horizon, ensuring the celestial energies align with the ceremony.

C. Offerings to Forest Entities
1. ****To the Forest Lord****: A carved and polished wooden statuette depicting the Forest Lord, placed under the largest oak within the grove.
2. ****To the Guardian Spirits****: Sprigs of yew, holly, and mistletoe, to be burned as incense during the initiation.
3. ****To the Nymphs****: A silver bowl filled with pure water drawn from a nearby enchanted spring, garnished with white rose petals.

D. Ritualistic Tools
1. ****Staff of Initiation****: A wooden staff adorned with symbols representing the path of the Forest Lord and topped with a quartz crystal, used to channel and direct energies.
2. ****Cloaks****: Initiates are given the cloaks of the Forest Lords, dyed in deep forest green, signifying their commitment to the order.
3. ****Silver Athame****: A small ritual dagger used to etch the initiate's name in the bark of a sacred oak tree as a symbol of their bond with the woodland spirits.

### II. Ceremony
A. Opening Invocation
1. The initiator raises the staff to the Waxing Gibbous Moon, calling upon the Forest Lord, guardian spirits, and nymphs to bear witness to the ceremony.
2. The initiator presents the offerings, reciting prayers and calls to action to each forest entity.

B. Initiate's Consecration

C. Oath and Bonding

2. Using the silver athame, the initiator carves each initiate's name into the ancient oak tree.
3. The initiator channels the energies of the sacred grove through the staff of initiation, directing it towards the initiates, symbolically enhancing their connection to the woodland spirits.
