Ritual Name: The Five Dragon Aspects Metamorphosis

Goal: To harness the energies of the five revered Dragon aspects (Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Spirit) and catalyze profound personal metamorphosis.

Essential components:
1. Symbolic items
2. Ancient incantations
3. Specific summoning methods

### I. Preparation

A. **Gathering Symbolic Items**:
1. Earth - Five small stones, ideally from a place of personal significance
2. Fire - A fireproof cauldron or dish to safely hold a small, controlled flame
3. Water - A chalice filled with pure spring water
4. Air - A feather from a bird that resonates with your own energy
5. Spirit - A crystal that you feel drawn to for its spiritual properties

B. **Preparing the Sacred Space**:
Select an indoor or outdoor location where you can create a sacred space free from interruption. Ideally, this place should have some connection to each of the five natural elements. Make sure the area is clean and organized.

C. **Consecrating the Items**:
Cleanse each symbolic item by running it through the smoke of sage or other sacred herbs and placing it in the appropriate orientation within your sacred space. **Each item will represent one cardinal direction**:

1. Earth - North
2. Fire - South
3. Water - West
4. Air - East
5. Spirit - Center

### II. Invocation - Summoning the Five Dragon Aspects

A. **Earth - Terra Drakonum**:
Stand at the northern point of the circle, holding the stones:
Incantation: "O' mighty Terra Drakonum, embodiment of Earth, grant me the grounding and stability to undergo this metamorphosis."

B. **Fire - Ignis Draconis**:
Stand at the southern point, lighting the fire in the cauldron:
Incantation: "O' blazing Ignis Draconis, spirit of Fire, ignite the transformative flames within my soul."

C. **Water - Aqua Dracónis**:
Stand at the western point, holding the chalice of water:
Incantation: "O' flowing Aqua Dracónis, essence of Water, cleanse me of fear and doubt and prepare me for rebirth."

D. **Air - Ventus Draconem**:
Stand at the eastern point, holding the feather:
Incantation: "O' soaring Ventus Draconem, breath of Air, infuse my spirit with clarity and wisdom."

E. **Spirit - Anima Draco**:
Stand at the center, holding the crystal:
Incantation: "O' divine Anima Draco, eternal Spirit, guide me through this transformation and unite these aspects within me."

### III. Transformation

A. **Balancing and Harmonizing**:
Sit or stand in the center of the circle meditating upon each of the five aspects and their unique qualities. Visualize them merging within you, creating a perfect balance within your being.

B. **Releasing and Accepting**:
Release past traumas, negative thought patterns, and all that no longer serves your growth. Open yourself up to accepting the gifts, wisdom, and strength from the five Dragon aspects.

C. **Final Incantation**:
Chant the following invocation three times while holding the crystal close to your heart:
"By the power of Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Spirit, I welcome this metamorphosis, and the wisdom and strength of the five Dragon aspects. Let it be so."

D. **Closure**:
Thank each of the Dragons individually, starting from the center with Anima Draco and proceeding counterclockwise. Finally, put out the flame in the cauldron and leave the sacred space.

### IV. Aftercare

Integrate the energies and insight from the ritual into your daily life as you undergo transformation. Remember that growth is a process and to honor the changes as they unfold.

Note: This ritual can be adapted or expanded to include additional details or symbolism that resonate with your personal journey. Just ensure the harmony between the five Dragon aspects is preserved.
