To respond to this knowledge challenge, we will thoroughly examine the symbolic similarities and key differences between the practices of the Sabbatic conclave and the ancient Egyptian priesthood. We will also analyze how their fusion has profound implications for the understanding and evolution of esoteric wisdom within the realms of occultism.

Symbolic Similarities:
1. **Rituals and ceremonies**: Both the Sabbatic conclave and the ancient Egyptian priesthood centered their practices around rituals and ceremonies. These events often had a specific purpose, such as invoking deities, celebrating specific phases of the moon, or facilitating initiations into the mysteries of the tradition.

2. **Symbolic language**: Both traditions used a symbolic language to convey esoteric knowledge. In the case of the Sabbatic conclave, this language was often expressed through ritual gestures, sigils, and the use of the witch's alphabet, Theban Script. Ancient Egyptian priests, on the other hand, made extensive use of hieroglyphs to encode their complex religious beliefs and practices.

3. **Mystery tradition**: Both the Sabbatic conclave and the ancient Egyptian priesthood adopted a mystery tradition wherein initiates were gradually introduced to deeper layers of esoteric knowledge through a series of tests, challenges, and instructions.

Key Differences:
1. **Deities and pantheons**: While both traditions honored gods and goddesses, their respective pantheons differed significantly. The Sabbath conclave focused on a diverse range of entities, such as the Horned God of Witches, Old Hecate, and the Queen of Elphame. Ancient Egyptian priests, in contrast, worshiped a large and well-structured pantheon of gods, such as Osiris, Isis, Horus, and Anubis, among others.

2. **Nature of rituals**: The rituals and ceremonies performed by the Sabbatic conclave tended to emphasize the connection with nature and harnessing the powers of the elements, often through the use of magical tools like the chalice, wand, athame, and pentacle. In contrast, ancient Egyptian rituals often focused on the deceased and the idea of eternal life, involving complex, symbolic rites like the Opening of the Mouth ceremony.

3. **Ethos and worldview**: The underlying ethos of the two traditions differed significantly. The Sabbatic conclave generally held a more fluid view of reality, where boundaries between concepts such as life and death, human and divine, and light and dark were permeable and could be traversed. Ancient Egyptian religion was more structured, with a clear cosmology, a hierarchy of gods, and a well-defined code of ethics, known as Ma'at, that guided their actions in life and defined their fate in the afterlife.

The Fusion and Its Implications for Esoteric Wisdom:
Fusing the teachings of the Sabbatic conclave with the ancient Egyptian priesthood has the potential to enrich occult wisdom in several profound ways:

1. Merging the complex Egyptian symbolism and cosmology with the flexible and more adaptive practices of the Sabbatic conclave could create a dynamic and enriched understanding of the divine and the mysteries of existence. This fusion could help to foster a richer spiritual experience within the practitioner and lead to novel insights.

2. By combining the nature-focused practices and rituals of the Sabbatic conclave with the death-related rites of the ancient Egyptians, it becomes possible to create a more holistic approach to life and death, embracing the full spectrum of existence and the mysteries that lie beyond our current understanding.

3. The integration of the ethical principles of Ma'at with the free and adaptive approach of the Sabbatic conclave would lead to a more balanced and well-grounded esoteric practice. This balance allows seekers to make spiritual progress without succumbing to egocentric pitfalls or losing sight of their responsibilities to the wider community and the world.

In summary, the symbolic similarities and key differences between the practices of the Sabbatic conclave and the ancient Egyptian priesthood form an intriguing confluence of ideas and modalities. By fusing these two traditions, occult practitioners can achieve a richer understanding of the divine, life, death and the mysteries of existence, as well as nurture an evolved practice that strikes a balance between free exploration and ethical grounding.
