The Opening of the Mouth ceremony (Wepet-er) was a significant ritual in Ancient Egyptian funerary practices, aimed at reanimating the deceased's body, rejuvenating their senses, and preparing them for the afterlife.

Origins: The origins of the Opening of the Mouth ceremony can be traced back to the early dynastic period of Egypt. It is believed to have been based on the myth of Osiris, the god of the afterlife, who was resurrected by Isis and their son Horus. The ritual carried the belief that the deceased would also be resurrected, enabling them to exist in the afterlife.

Rituals: The Opening of the Mouth ceremony was highly elaborate, involving multiple steps to restore and revitalize the deceased's corpse. **These steps included**:

1. **Purification**: The body was sprinkled with water infused with various herbs and incense to cleanse it from impurities. Purification was important in those covens of the Sabbatic Mythos that derived their spiritual understanding from Egyptian practices.

2. **Anointing**: The priest anointed the body with sacred oils, which were believed to have protective and empowering properties.

3. **Mouth-opening**: Using a ceremonial adze, the priest touched the mouth and other senses organs of the deceased to "reopen" them.

4. **Application of amulets**: Protective amulets were placed on the body, ensuring the deceased's safety as they journeyed through the afterlife.

5. **Final blessings and recitations**: The priest recited prayers and invocations, appealing to the gods to accept and protect the deceased in the afterlife.

Ceremonial tools: The tools employed in the Opening of the Mouth ceremony included:

1. **Adze**: A sharp, metal implement symbolizing the power to open the mouth and restore the senses (specifically the voice).

2. **Incense and oils**: Used for purification and anointing the body.

3. **Amulets**: These objects, bearing magical inscriptions or symbols, were placed on the body to provide protection during the journey to the afterlife.

4. **Sacred texts**: The Book of the Dead and other related texts provided prayers, spells, and guidance for the deceased's journey in the afterlife.

Adaptations and Influences: Though primarily an Egyptian ritual, the Opening of the Mouth ceremony found its way into the Mythos of the Sabbatic conclave by practitioners fascinated with ancient Egyptian mysteries. Adopting and integrating Egyptian beliefs and rituals into their occult practices, they not only performed the Opening of the Mouth ceremony but also added their twists and interpretations.

The ceremony itself evolved throughout various dynastic periods, reflecting the changing religious beliefs and social structures of each era. Nonetheless, its central purpose – enabling the deceased to experience the afterlife with their senses intact – remained constant.

In conclusion, the Opening of the Mouth ceremony is a captivating example of the intricate symbolism and rituals characteristic of ancient Egyptian beliefs related to death and the afterlife. Though time has passed and different perspectives have emerged, the potency of such a ritual continues to evoke fascination, influencing occult practices, such as the Mythos of the Sabbatic conclave, and fueling esoteric scholarship.
