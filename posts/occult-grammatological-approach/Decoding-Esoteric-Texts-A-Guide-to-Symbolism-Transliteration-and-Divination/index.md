To fully address this knowledge challenge, we must first break down the main components of the question and establish their definitions and significance within the context of the occult grammatological approach. ****These components are****: symbolism, transliteration, divination, esoteric texts, hidden correspondences, meanings, and multilayered nature.

Symbolism refers to the use of symbols to represent ideas or qualities, which can be understood on different levels. In occultism, symbols carry esoteric meanings and act as links between the visible and invisible realms. Transliteration is the process of converting letters or words from one writing system into another, often to make a text accessible to a different language or culture. Divination is the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by various means and often involves interpreting signs, symbols, or patterns.

Esoteric texts are writings containing hidden or secret teachings meant for a select group of individuals who possess the necessary knowledge or understanding to comprehend and apply their contents. Hidden correspondences are occult links or connections between seemingly unrelated entities or concepts that reveal a deeper meaning or significance when understood in the proper context. Meanings refer to the messages or information conveyed by a text, which can vary depending on the level of understanding and interpretation applied to the material. The multilayered nature of esoteric texts refers to the various levels of interpretation or understanding that can be derived from a single passage, based on the reader's background, skills, and intuitive insights.

Now that we have established the key components of the question, let us discuss the step-by-step reasoning process to explore the interrelation of symbolism, transliteration, and divination to uncover hidden correspondences and meanings in esoteric texts.

1. ****Discovery of symbols****: The first step involves identifying the symbols present in the esoteric text. These symbols can be characters, glyphs, diagrams, or even patterns woven into the structure of the text itself. This may require knowledge of symbology, mythology, and comparative religion to correctly recognize and interpret these symbols.

2. ****Transliteration of symbols****: Once the symbols are identified, they may need to be transliterated into a form that can be more easily understood or interpreted. This may involve converting characters from one language or script to another or making associations between symbols from different cultural or historical contexts. The process of transliteration can open up new perspectives and reveal previously hidden layers of meaning within the text.

3. ****Divination and intuitive interpretation****: Having obtained a clearer understanding of the symbols and their possible meanings through transliteration, the next step is to employ divination methods, such as Tarot, I Ching, or scrying, to explore the subtle dimensions of the text. Divination and intuitive interpretation allow the reader to delve deeper into the text by tapping into their subconscious mind and establishing a direct link with the hidden knowledge encoded within the symbols.

4. ****Uncovering hidden correspondences****: By combining the insights gained through symbolism, transliteration, and divination, the reader can begin to recognize hidden correspondences within the text. These connections may involve linguistic patterns, numerological relationships, or symbolic links between different elements of the text. By understanding these correspondences, the reader can begin to grasp the multilayered nature of the text and the deeper meanings contained within.

5. ****Integration of knowledge and insights****: The final step involves integrating the newfound knowledge and insights into one's personal understanding and worldview. This personal transformative process is ultimately the goal of engaging with esoteric texts and the occult grammatological approach.

In conclusion, the interrelation of symbolism, transliteration, and divination within the occult grammatological approach allows for the discovery of hidden correspondences and meanings in esoteric texts. This process reveals the underlying multilayered nature of these texts and provides insights into the subtle influences they contain. By engaging in this process, the reader is able to gain a deeper understanding of the wisdom and knowledge encoded within esoteric texts, leading to personal transformation and spiritual growth.
