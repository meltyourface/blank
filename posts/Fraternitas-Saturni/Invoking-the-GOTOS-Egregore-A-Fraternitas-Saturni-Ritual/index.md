  Design a ritual for invoking the Fraternitas Saturni egregore into a group working by incorporating the foundational principles, symbols, and esoteric lore specific to the Fraternitas Saturni tradition. Develop a series of precisely sequenced ritual steps blending the use of astral projection, sigil crafting, and planetary invocations. The ritual should include elaborate ceremonial attire, designated roles for participants, and incorporate the use of Saturnian correspondences such as lead, obsidian, and the hexagram seal.

## Title: The Ritual of the GOTOS Egregore

**Objective**: To invoke the Fraternitas Saturni egregore into a group working by incorporating the foundational principles, symbols, esoteric lore specific to the Fraternitas Saturni tradition.

**Preparation**:
1. Select a secluded and quiet location where the ritual will take place.
2. Choose a day that corresponds with Saturn, traditionally Saturday, during a waning moon phase.
3. Prepare the ritual space with a consecrated altar facing North, where the energies of Saturn are strongest.
4. On the altar, place a black, six-sided obsidian crystal as a representative of Binah's black light, a lead Sigillum Fraternitas Saturni, and a hexagram seal beneath the sigil.
5. Each participant should wear elaborate ceremonial attire, preferably black robes adorned with planetary symbols, especially those related to Saturn.
6. Participants should prepare themselves by fasting for 24 hours prior to the ritual and abstaining from any sexual activity.

Roles for participants:
1. **The Saturnian Magus**: Leads the evocations, guides the astral projection, and directs the energies of the egregore.
2. **The Sigil Bearer**: Holds the crafted sigil during the ritual to focus the group's collective energy.
3. **The Guardian of the Portal**: Guards the entrance to the ritual space, ensuring no unwanted energies or distractions enter.

Ritual Steps:
1. All participants sit or kneel in a circle around the altar, with the Saturnian Magus in the North and the Sigil Bearer in the South.
2. The Guardian of the Portal sweeps the ritual space with a consecrated broom or staff, symbolically clearing any negative energies. Afterward, they stand at the entrance to the space.
3. The Saturnian Magus begins the ritual by invoking the energies of Saturn by reciting "Agios O Satanas, Veni Kether Binah Ghagiel!" ("Holy Satan, come, Crown, Understanding, and Gagiel!")
4. Light black and purple candles in a counterclockwise direction, beginning and ending in the North.
5. The Sigil Bearer presents the crafted sigil to each participant, for them to imbue with their intentions and energies.
6. All participants, led by the Saturnian Magus, perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram.
7. The Saturnian Magus guides the group in deep meditation, preparing them for astral projection.
8. As each participant reaches the astral plane, they visualize the sigil and call upon the GOTOS egregore by chanting "Egregoros GOTOS Thagirion!" ("Egregore GOTOS, come forth from Thagirion!")
9. Participants feel the energies of the Fraternitas Saturni egregore fill the ritual space.
10. The Saturnian Magus offers a final invocation, calling upon the egregore to imbue the group with wisdom, power, and guidance in their workings.
11. All participants thank the egregore and Saturnian energies through a collective Hallelujah.
12. The Guardian of the Portal signals the conclusion of the ritual.
13. Record the experience in the group's magical journal for future reference and analysis.

**Reminder**:
Remember to maintain focused intention throughout the ritual, ensuring that all participants are in harmony with the egregore's energies. After the ritual, the group's bond with the GOTOS egregore will strengthen their collective Fraternitas Saturni practices and manifest profound magickal effects.
