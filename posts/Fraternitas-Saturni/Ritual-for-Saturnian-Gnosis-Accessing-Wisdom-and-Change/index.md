## Rite of the Stellar Gnosis

Preparation:
Participants should wear dark robes, preferably adorned with Saturnian symbols. Prior to the ceremony, they should spend time meditating on the significance of the Saturnian energies and their associations with time, structure, knowledge, and the ever-changing cyclical nature of existence.

### I. Construction of the Altar

1. Choose a space where the altar will be central to the ritual area.
2. Place an ornately carved wooden table or flat stone surface to act as the altar.
3. Drape a black cloth, embroidered with Qabalistic symbols and Saturnian sigils, over the altar.
4. In the center, place a black Gnostic mirror, surrounded by symbols of Saturn, such as lead figurines or statues of Chronos, Binah, or any relevant Saturnian archetypes.
5. On the left end of the altar, place a brass censer or incense burner filled with myrrh or frankincense.
6. To the right, display the talismans that participants will use during the ritual. Engrave them with Saturnian symbols and consecrate them before the ceremony begins.

### II. Cleansing and Consecrating the Ritual Space

1. Create a smoke by igniting the myrrh or frankincense incense. Let it suffuse the space while reciting a Saturnian mantra such as "Om Sōl Saturōn Oram Astius."
2. Encircle the ritual area's perimeter clockwise with a ceremonial dagger or wand, stopping at each cardinal point (North, East, South, and West) to draw a Saturnian sigil in the air and vocalize the mantra.
3. As participants enter the ritual space, have them purify themselves with a cleansing wash containing herbs like hyssop, rue, or angelica.

### III. Talismatic Magick

1. Each participant chooses a talisman, placing it on the altar.
2. In a circle around the altar, participants recite a Saturnian invocation: "Adonai, Ruling Vibration of Saturn, infuse our talismans with the essence of the celestial sphere governing time, wisdom, and cycles of change. Grant us the power to utilize these energies in the pursuit of Gnosis."

### IV. Invoking the Saturnian Forces

1. Participants form a circle around the altar, facing inward.
2. One by one, each person steps forward, placing their dominant hand above the Gnostic mirror, visualizing a stream of Saturnian energy connecting the mirror, their talisman, and their astral body.
3. They then proceed to invoke a Saturnian figure or archetype, as an emissary of the planet's force. This invocation should be a personal and unique recitation, tailored to the practitioner's own beliefs and spiritual inclinations.

### V. Advanced Astral Work and Evocation

1. Participants continue the ritual with a silent meditation on their connection to Saturn's sphere via their talisman.
2. Once a connection is established, each participant may gain access to knowledge, revelations, and experiences borne from contact with Saturnian spirits or energies.

### VI. Sharing Gnosis and Recommitment

1. Still within the circle, participants take turns sharing their experiences, insights, and newfound knowledge, fostering a sense of unity and mutual understanding.
2. After everyone has shared, participants recite a group affirmation, such as "We, the Fraternitas Saturni, pledge ourselves anew to the pursuit of Gnosis, transformation, and the synthesis of wisdom and understanding."

### VII. Closing the Ceremony

1. Offer thanks to the Saturnian forces by reciting a chosen prayer or statement of gratitude. Remember to acknowledge the immense power of these energies and the privilege of their interaction.
2. Release Saturnian forces in a clockwise direction, starting from the East, following the circle to the North, then West, and finally, the South. As each participant leaves the circle and the presence of the altar, they must perform a banishing ritual, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, to restore balance and dissolve the connection with Saturn's sphere.
3. Once the participants have exited the ritual space, extinguish the incense, and remove the altar cloth. Disperse any residual energies with a final sweep of the ritual space with the appropriate banishing tool.

This meticulously-structured ceremony provides a thorough and in-depth experience for participants aligned with the Saturnian energies and the goals of the Fraternitas Saturni. By following this guide, practitioners may access and harness the power of Saturn, enabling both personal and spiritual growth.
