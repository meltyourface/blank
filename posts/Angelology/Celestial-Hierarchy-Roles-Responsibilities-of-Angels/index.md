In Angelology, angels are organized into hierarchies and ranks, each with its distinct responsibilities and roles. In the celestial realm, the hierarchical structure and roles of angels are primarily based on the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a Christian theologian living during the 5th or early 6th century. His work 'The Celestial Hierarchy' details the order and rankings of angels.

According to Pseudo-Dionysius, the angelic hierarchy is divided into three spheres, which, in turn, are subdivided into three orders, totaling nine ranks of celestial beings. These are:

1. First Sphere (closest to God)
   - Seraphim
   - Cherubim
   - Thrones

2. Second Sphere (related to the cosmos)
   - Dominions (Dominations)
   - Virtues
   - Powers (Authorities)

3. Third Sphere (involved with human affairs)
   - Principalities (Rulers)
   - Archangels
   - Angels

While the Archangels are known for guiding humanity in religious, moral, and spiritual matters, they are not the highest-ranking beings in the celestial hierarchy. The highest order consists of Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones, which are directly involved in the worship and praise of God.

Additionally, it is important to mention that Dominions play a significant role in the angelic hierarchy. They are thought to preside over the lower ranks of angels, ensuring that the cosmos remains harmonious. However, it is widely acknowledged that Principalities, alongside Archangels, are entrusted with the task of protecting nations, cities, and leaders, making this the most accurate statement in the context of Angelology.
