In order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the roles and attributes of Archangels Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, we first need to understand the historical and religious contexts in which they have been presented. We will explore their scriptural accounts in both Abrahamic religions and noncanonical texts, as well as their significance in occult and esoteric traditions.

Archangel Gabriel:

Gabriel is an archangel primarily recognized in the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In the Hebrew Bible, Gabriel is mentioned in the Book of Daniel as a messenger who interprets Daniel's visions. In the Christian New Testament, Gabriel appears in the Gospel of Luke, where he announces the forthcoming births of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. In Islamic tradition, Gabriel (referred to as Jibril) is believed to have transmitted Allah's divine messages to the Prophet Muhammad, thus forming the Islamic holy book, the Quran.

In esoteric and occult traditions, Gabriel is often associated with the element of water, symbolizing emotions, intuition, and spiritual cleansing. As the messenger of divine revelations, Gabriel also represents the importance of communication with higher dimensions and spiritual awakening.

Archangel Michael:

Michael is portrayed as a warrior and protector in many religious texts. In the Hebrew Bible, he appears in the Book of Daniel as a "chief prince" who plays a significant role in the end times. In the Christian New Testament, Michael is mentioned in the Letter of Jude and the Book of Revelation as the leader of God's armies in the battle against Satan. In Islamic tradition, Michael (also referred to as Mikail) is considered the archangel of mercy, responsible for providing humans with sustenance, rain, and knowledge.

In esoteric and occult traditions, Michael is often associated with the element of fire, symbolizing protection, strength, and courage. As a warrior who defends against evil forces, he embodies the spiritual warrior within all humans who strive to overcome their inner and outer struggles.

Archangel Raphael:

Raphael is best known for his role as a healer in various religious texts. In the Hebrew Bible, he appears in the Book of Tobit, healing Tobit's blindness and helping his son Tobias on his journey. His name means "God heals" in Hebrew. Although not explicitly mentioned in the Christian New Testament, Raphael is identified as an archangel in various noncanonical Christian texts. In Islamic tradition, Raphael (referred to as Israfil) is considered the angel of resurrection, who will blow the trumpet that signals the Day of Judgment.

In esoteric and occult traditions, Raphael is associated with the element of air, symbolizing the mind, intellect, and healing. As the healer archangel, Raphael represents spiritual and physical healing, wisdom, and guidance on the path to self-awareness and enlightenment.

Interconnections and Insights:

1. Roles: Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael play distinct roles in religious texts – Gabriel as a messenger, Michael as a protector, and Raphael as a healer. However, they all share the common theme of serving as intermediaries between the divine and human realms, guiding, protecting, and nurturing humanity.

2. Attributes: In esoteric and occult traditions, they are each associated with different elements – Gabriel with water, Michael with fire, and Raphael with air. These associations reflect their distinct qualities and the areas of life they most closely influence.

3. Convergence and Divergence: Although they fulfill separate functions in religious texts, the actions of these archangels complement one another, working together for the greater good of humanity. Their distinct roles highlight different aspects of spiritual growth, with Gabriel representing communication and intuition, Michael embodying strength and courage, and Raphael exemplifying healing and wisdom.

In conclusion, the archangels Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael hold unique roles and attributes in their scriptural accounts and various occult and esoteric traditions. However, their essential nature as intermediaries between the divine and human realms unites their purpose. By analyzing their appearances in religious texts and occult associations, seekers can gain a deeper understanding of the spiritual principles these archangels represent, and harness their energies for personal growth and spiritual development.
