Archangels

In the study of Angelology, which is the branch of theology focusing on angels, the celestial hierarchy responsible for the implementation of Divine plans and in close relation to humans through dreams and visions is the Archangels. Archangels are ranked among the lower Hierarchies of angels but hold a critical role as messengers or attendants to God.

The concept of celestial hierarchy in Angelology comes from various religious beliefs and texts, especially Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. A significant source of our knowledge of angelic hierarchies is the work of Pseudo-Dionysius, a 5th-century Christian theologian, who categorized the angels into nine realms or choirs. These nine choirs are further divided into three tiers:

1. First Tier: The high-ranking angels who are closest to God
   - Seraphim: Often associated with purity, they are the highest-ranking angels, perpetually singing praises to the Divine.
   - Cherubim: Guardians of divine wisdom, they are associated with enlightenment and guardianship of sacred spaces like the Garden of Eden.
   - Thrones: Regarded as the symbols of divine justice, they serve as the seat of Godâ€™s throne and represent His authority.

2. Second Tier: The angels who rule over the heavens and maintain cosmic order
   - Dominions: Regulate the duties and roles of lower-ranked angels, making sure that divine orders function smoothly.
   - Virtues: Bestow blessings and miracles upon the world, collaborating with the Dominions to ensure that the cosmos remains in order and balance.
   - Powers: Protectors of the cosmos from evil and chaos, they have the primary duty of fighting against any demonic forces that threaten the divine order.

3. Third Tier: The angels who are closest to humanity, serving as protectors, guides, and messengers
   - Principalities: Guardians of nations and cities, responsible for inspiring human leaders and fostering the growth of culture, art, and science.
   - Archangels: Tasked with delivering important messages from the Divine to humans and carrying out God's will. This is the group of angels responsible for the implementation of Divine plans and working through dreams and visions. The most well-known archangels are Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel.
   - Angels: The lowest-ranking choir in the celestial hierarchy, they act as personal guardians for individual humans, guiding them in their everyday lives.

In conclusion, Archangels are responsible for implementing divine plans and working directly with humans through dreams and visions. Their role as messengers and facilitators of divine tasks makes them crucial in the celestial hierarchy, bridging the gap between humans and the divine realm.
