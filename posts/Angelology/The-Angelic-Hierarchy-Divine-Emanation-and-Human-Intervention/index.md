In order to fully comprehend and respond to this challenge, we must first understand the key concepts behind the angelic hierarchy, divine emanation, and grace. Pseudo-Dionysius, a Christian theologian and philosopher who lived in the late 5th to early 6th century, is largely credited with the creation of the celestial hierarchy as it is best known today. His works, such as "The Celestial Hierarchy" and "The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy," elaborated on and categorized angels, assigning them roles and responsibilities, and organizing them into a coherent structure. This question specifically asks us to delve into the angelic hierarchy outlined by Pseudo-Dionysius, elucidating its connections with divine emanation principles and exploring the influences within the human experience of divine grace and intervention.

First and foremost, let us explore the hierarchical structure designed by Pseudo-Dionysius. He organized angels into three sets, each containing three orders, thereby creating nine distinct orders, or "choirs," in total. The three-fold division characterizes the hierarchy as trinitarian and echoes the divine authority of the Holy Trinity. Each set extends from the highest-ranking choir down to the lowest-ranking choir, and each serves to illustrate the progression from the divine to the human realm. The hierarchy is as follows:

First Set:

1. Seraphim - These angels are known for their passionate love and adoration of God. They surround God's throne and continually sing his praises. The name Seraphim means "the burning ones" and signifies their intense devotion.

2. Cherubim - These beings represent divine wisdom, knowledge, and enlightenment. They protect God's presence from unworthy souls or entities. Cherubim are typically depicted with four wings, four faces, and the form of an ox, lion, eagle, and human.

3. Thrones - This order of angels consists of agents of divine justice, known for their great humility. They serve as a link between the first and second sets of the angelic hierarchy. 

Second Set:

4. Dominions - Strengthening the divide between the realms of angels and humans, Dominions govern over the other angelic choirs. They manage the flow of God's creative energy, maintaining order among the lower ranks of angels.

5. Virtues - These angels are responsible for administrating miracles and heavenly blessings in the human world. Virtues serve as intermediaries between the Dominions and the Powers.

6. Powers - The Powers are agents of divine intervention, providing heavenly balance. They protect our world from the influence of evil spirits and disharmony.

Third Set:

7. Principalities - Tasked with overseeing nations and other human collectives, Principalities work closely with those in the second set to ensure God's will is carried out among humans.

8. Archangels - Archangels are God's emissaries, responsible for delivering important messages and carrying out missions. These beings are more involved with human affairs as they serve as intermediaries between angels and humans.

9. Angels - This last choir is the closest to the human realm. They serve as guardians and counselors to individuals, guiding and assisting them in their spiritual journeys. Angels form a bridge between the human experience and the divine.

The architectonic structure of Pseudo-Dionysius's angelic hierarchy embodies the principles of divine emanation. God's divine energy or essence—referred to as "theophany" or "divine light"—flows through this hierarchy, diminishing as it moves from the highest to the lowest rank. As each angelic order, in turn, reflects the divine radiance, it does so in a way that adapts to the progressively lower realm. As the influence streams down the hierarchies, it links angels directly to God's creative energy, which they use to interact with humanity in various ways.

Regarding the human experience of divine grace and intervention, this angelic hierarchy acts as a conduit through which God's assistance can reach humanity. Each rank of angels has specific roles related to the human realm, be it overseeing nations, providing guidance, or delivering messages. The structure ensures the continuous exchange of divine energy between different levels of celestial beings, guaranteeing that the human world remains under the watchful care of higher echelons.

In summary, Pseudo-Dionysius's angelic hierarchy organizes celestial beings into nine distinct orders, which stem from the divine authority of the Holy Trinity. This structure manifests the principles of divine emanation, as God's divine light cascades through the hierarchies, ultimately reaching the human world. The system thus plays a central role in defining the human experience of divine grace and intervention by providing channels through which angels—acting as intermediaries—can intervene and assist humans in their spiritual quests.
