In the shadow of the Crimson Pyramid's glow,
Lie cryptic runes of fire, enigmatically bestow.
Seek the wisdom of the ancient Red Temple's might,
For only through riddles, you shall conquer the night.

Three verses await the seeker who dares,
Inscribed with calligraphic lines, perceived in pairs.
Let the Runic Fire Sigil ignite your core,
To unlock the codes and pass through the door.

The first verse whispers of the sanguine specter's reign,
Boundless power, when the azure moon doth drain.
Combine the sigils, and you shall conceive,
In its reflection, secrets of ages it shall retrieve.

Next look toward the fallen constellations' grievance,
As fiery ink doth mark the Red Temple's obedience.
The sun above splits in half, revealing a secret to behold,
Reversed and mirrored, offering guidance untold.

Finally, decode the riddles of aether and one's inner sight,
As the elements merge within the sacred chamber of light.
Look to the corners for symbols to accumulate,
For there lie the keys, gravitating to the artifact's fate.

Solve the enigma, the Red Temple's test of valor, pure,
To awaken the path and reveal the mysterium's allure.
Through the arcane whispers and the veiled labyrinth, delve,
And the sanctum awaits, bestowing the secret it shall shelve.

Take heed, brave seeker, tread with caution and grace,
For the Red Temple's wisdom can conceal, as well as embrace.
Learn from its power and harness its mysteries untold,
And the gates of the occult shall open, offering truths manifold.
