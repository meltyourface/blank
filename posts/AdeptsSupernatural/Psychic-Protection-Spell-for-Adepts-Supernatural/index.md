To craft an intricate, multi-layered protection spell against psychic attacks within the realm of AdeptsSupernatural, we will incorporate ancient sigils, astrological correspondences, and uncommon crystal combinations. The ritual that binds these elements together will include chants and gestures, demonstrating our in-depth understanding of supernatural lore and expertise in the esoteric arts.

Sigil Craft:
Begin by selecting three ancient sigils, each representing protection against specific types of psychic attacks. The first sigil, Aegishjalmur, symbolizes protection against mental manipulation and influence. The second, the Seal of Solomon, safeguards the caster against hexes or curses. The third, the Bindrune of Algiz and Ansuz, defends against spiritual or ethereal intrusions.

Astrological Correspondences:
Align the creation and casting of the spell with the most powerful astrological phases that promote protection and fortification of the self. Optimal times for constructing this spell align with the New Moon in Scorpio, which intensifies protection and transformative energies. Also, ensure that Mars – a planet of power and defense – is in a favorable position, such as being in its domicile (Aries or Scorpio) or exalted (Capricorn).

Crystal Combinations:
Assemble an uncommon combination of crystals that strengthen the spell's efficacy. Use black tourmaline, a powerful grounding stone that shields against psychic attacks; labradorite, a crystal that promotes intuitive abilities and guards against negative energy; and malachite, which amplifies protection from external threats while encouraging personal growth.

Ritual Procedure:
1. Choose a sacred space, cleanse it with sage or another purifying agent, and cast a circle.
2. Draw the protection sigils on a piece of parchment while focusing your intentions on shielding against psychic attacks.
3. Place the black tourmaline, labradorite, and malachite in a triangular formation around the parchment, with each stone touching one of the sigils.
4. Stand or sit within the circle during the New Moon in Scorpio, facing the direction of Mars in the sky.
5. Close your eyes, and take three deep breaths, centering your energy and grounding yourself.
6. Recite the following chant, imbuing each word with your intention of psychic protection:
   "By the sigils of ancient might,
    By the stars that guide the night,
    By the crystals, earth's own key,
    Psychic bounds, they bend to me.
    Aegishjalmur's helm of awe,
    Solomon's seal, divinity's law,
    Bindrune of Algiz and Ansuz, shield,
    Together guard me, defense they wield.
    As I will it, so mote it be,
    Protection's veil encircles me!"

7. After completing the chant, visualize a protective barrier surrounding you and emanating from the sigils on the parchment. This barrier pulses with energy from the astrological correspondences and the crystals selected.
8. Once you feel the shield is firmly in place, allow it to settle and become a part of your aura.
9. Carefully open the circle, knowing that the protection spell now resides within you.

By harmoniously integrating ancient sigils, astrological correspondences, uncommon crystal combinations, and a unique ritual that includes chants and gestures, a powerful multi-layered protection spell against psychic attacks within the realm of AdeptsSupernatural has been crafted, demonstrating mastery in the esoteric arts.
