The Heptameron, a seminal occult grimoire attributed to the Italian philosopher and physician Pietro D'Abano, is just as much a reflection of its author's intellectual pedigree as it is a manual for invoking the spirits of the natural world. Its subsequent influence on the European occult tradition can be traced through several key figures and periods, whose contributions have ensured that the grimoire's unique blend of Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, and Islamic thought continues to resonate with contemporary practitioners.

1. ****Pietro D'Abano (1250-1316)****: The foundation of our genealogy begins with Pietro D'Abano himself, who studied in Paris and received his doctorate in medicine from the University of Padua. As a physician and philosopher, D'Abano's work focused on reconciling Greek, Roman, and Arabic thought with Christian doctrine, often exploring the mystical aspects of religion, philosophy, and the natural sciences.

2. ****Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499)****: A fervent admirer of D'Abano, Ficino was a key figure in the Florentine Renaissance, responsible for translating the Corpus Hermeticum, Plotinus, and other Neoplatonic texts into Latin. His syncretic approach to spirituality and philosophy heavily influenced the Heptameron, particularly in its emphasis on the importance of correspondences between celestial and terrestrial phenomena.

3. ****Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535)****: Agrippa's monumental work "De Occulta Philosophia" (Three Books of Occult Philosophy) adopted and expanded upon many of D'Abano's principles and methods. As a German polymath, Agrippa's attempts to systematize various occult disciplines helped to consolidate the European tradition, and his canonization of the Heptameron further enhanced its influence.

4. ****Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486-1535)****: One of the preeminent figures in early modern European occultism, and a keen student of D'Abano's works. The influence of the Heptameron can be seen throughout Agrippa's De occulta philosophia libri tres, both in terms of content (e.g., angelic hierarchies and planetary influences) and philosophical underpinnings (e.g., Neoplatonism and Hermeticism).

5. ****John Dee (1527-1608)****: As the royal astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I and a renowned mathematician, Dee had a significant impact on the European occult tradition. Drawing on the Heptameron, along with other foundational texts, Dee's Enochian system of angelic communication further solidified D'Abano's ideas on correspondences and hierarchies within the intellectual milieu of the 16th century.

6. ****Arthur Edward Waite (1857-1942)****: A prolific scholar of the esoteric, Waite's work in translating, compiling, and interpreting occult texts helped to bring D'Abano's Heptameron to the attention of a wider audience during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Waite's version of the Heptameron notably influenced the design, content, and symbolism of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck, which remains a widely used divination tool today.

7. ****Aleister Crowley (1875-1947)****: The English occultist and ceremonial magician was heavily influenced by the Heptameron and other grimoires of the Solomonic tradition. Crowley's "Liber 777," a compendium of magical correspondences, is partly indebted to the Heptameron for its intricate network of astrological, elemental, and angelic attributions.

In conclusion, the legacy of Pietro D'Abano's Heptameron has been preserved and propagated across various influential figures and time periods, with key players adding and adapting elements of the text to suit their philosophical ideas and practical applications. From the Renaissance to modern occultism, the fundamental concepts and techniques found within the Heptameron remain a vital cornerstone of the European occult tradition.
