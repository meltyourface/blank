To fully grasp the synthesis of Necromantic practices with Enochian angelic communication, we must first delve into the history, essence, and intricacies of both practices individually, and how their amalgamation leads to a unique perspective on life, death, and spiritual dimensions in occult philosophy.

### I. Necromantic Practices:
Necromancy is an ancient form of sorcery devoted to communing with the spirits of the dead. Originating from the Greek term "nekromanteia," which combines the words "nekros" (corpse) and "manteia" (divination or prophecy), necromancy focuses on summoning, invoking, or controlling the spirits of the deceased to gain secret knowledge, hidden treasures, or the ability to influence the living world.

Some key aspects of necromancy include:
1. Divination: The spirits, due to their disembodied state, possess knowledge unknown to the living and help a necromancer foresee future events.
2. Rituals: Necromancers perform elaborate ceremonies to establish contact with the spirits, often involving invocations, offerings, and the use of sacred, symbolic objects.
3. Control: Some necromancers may seek to control or bind spirits to their will, using this power to affect material and spiritual realms.

### II. Enochian Angelic Communication:
Enochian magic is a comprehensive system of angelic communication, initially revealed to the English scholar and occultist John Dee and his seer, Edward Kelley, in the late 16th century. Rooted heavily in the hermetic tradition, Enochian literature focuses on intensive, structured, and systematic interactions with celestial beings through a unique angelic language that has become synonymous with the system itself. The Enochian system is designed to facilitate human ascension beyond the material world and reach higher realms of divine consciousness.

Key aspects of Enochian angelic communication include:
1. Celestial Hierarchy: Enochian magic acknowledges a well-structured hierarchy of angels, each with a specific role in the celestial order.
2. Language: The Enochian language, regarded as the original language of the angels, serves as the critical means of communication with these entities.
3. Ritual & Sigils: Practitioners utilize specialized rituals, invoking angelic names and using specific sigils, to foster contact with the divine beings.

### III. Synthesizing Necromantic Practices and Enochian Angelic Communication:
The combination of necromantic practices with Enochian angelic communication merges the traditionally dark and mysterious aspect of death with the ethereal, divine, and celestial aspects of angelic involvement. By merging these two practices, we derive a unique perspective on life, death, and spiritual dimensions that recognize the interconnected relationship between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead.

This synthesis can manifest in a variety of ways:
1. Collaboration: Ascended spirits within the necromantic tradition may be placed alongside Enochian angels within the celestial hierarchy, allowing communication and collaboration between the two systems.
2. Ascension: The transformative process of death grants spirits access to higher realms of existence typically reserved for angelic beings in Enochian magic, promoting a deeper understanding of the spiritual journey experienced after death.
3. Balancing polarities: Merging these practices represents a unification of opposing cosmic forces, that is the darkness of death and the light of celestial existence, which fosters a holistic approach to spiritual development.

### IV. Unique Perspective on Life, Death, and Spiritual Dimensions:
The integration of Necromantic and Enochian practices invites a unique and all-encompassing view on the nature of life, death, and the spiritual world. It serves to:

1. Illuminate the interconnectedness: Combining the two practices highlights the interconnected nature of life and death, emphasizing that spiritual growth is a continuous journey transcending material existence.
2. Enhance esoteric knowledge: Incorporating the interaction between the realms of the living, the dead, and the divine allows practitioners to better tap into the vast reservoir of knowledge and wisdom available through various ethereal entities.
3. Embrace duality: Fusing these practices supports the belief that duality, such as life and death or good and evil, are integral aspects of existence. This balance allows an individual to attain harmony and understanding through all phases of their spiritual journey.

In conclusion, the synthesis of Necromantic practices with Enochian angelic communication creates a unique perspective on life, death, and spiritual dimensions by unifying the realms of the dead and divine, cultivating an interconnected and balanced view of existence in both material and ethereal realms. This amalgamation facilitates spiritual development, promotes a deeper understanding of duality, and emphasizes the endless pursuit of esoteric knowledge through communication with both the spirits of the dead and celestial entities.
