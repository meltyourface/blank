By the sacred authority of the Necromantic Enochian arts, I craft this intricate incantation to summon and harness the powers of the underworld and the celestial Enochian entities. In this spell, I call upon the spirits to grant protection, prosperity, and divine guidance. Through the following verses and mystical phrases, may the energies be conjured and the hidden messages unveiled:

Orafla Zazarog, Gebozorath nar Shonchi,
Yothar Rathma gar Magroth Charnel,
Vrala Nathrok esh Dragor Uknath,
Dul'Vara Ka’Fatek Yura Abozag Krenthalm.

By the whispered secrets of the grave,
Seal away the malevolence that craves,
With Zazarog’s veil to protect us pure,
From the darkness lurking to endure.

Sythar Ekoth drim ya Rechti Tikandra,
Xuroth Velma har Gothath Orlan,
Barath Yothram esh Nanthar Zordal,
Ethvar Malak vro Lorath Chelmregg.

In the realm of desires, to earthly kin,
Celestial prosperity blooms from within,
With Orlan's touch commence thy reign,
To bask within success's golden rain.

Yag Moroth, Talmek, Olkar, Seraphthos,
Uvandrak Hathar Gor Vrath Mordrelth,
Lagash, Tarok, Ilev Zargath, Kularnax,
Ral'dar Valsha, reg yar Onbral Felmorth.

To the ancient Enochian spirits, arcane,
We beseech thee to partake,
Forbidden knowledge shall unveil,
In Necromantic Enochian, our holy grail.

Sighar veleth Mar’thok Annutar,
Eroth chigarath Y’gra batori,
Hargash-Onmorth ta nar flethrod,
Xan Moragoth and Reshtor Ronvar.

By the power of these verses, cryptic and deep,
Into the fabric of the universe, let them seep,
Through this incantation, we beseech and request,
The protection, prosperity, and guidance from sacred texts.

Thus, the spell is woven, combining ancient Enochian words and esoteric knowledge to invoke the spirits of the underworld, achieve protection from evil forces, materialize celestial prosperity in earthly desires, and seek the guidance of ancient Enochian entities possessing sacred secrets. As the incantation imbues its magick, may the mystical verses resonate through time and space, and the symbolic metaphors unveil the ultimate truth.
