Introduction
To fully understand and appreciate the answer to this knowledge challenge, it is important to first familiarize ourselves with the key concepts involved:

1. **Sacred Geometry**: This refers to the study and application of geometric shapes and proportions that are considered to be sacred, divine, or universally significant in understanding the patterns of creation and the nature of reality.

2. **Astrological Correspondences**: These involve the relationship between celestial bodies and events, such as planetary alignments, zodiac signs, and astrological houses, and their potential influences on human behavior, emotions, and experiences.

3. **Divine Names**: These are the various names attributed to gods, goddesses, and other divine entities across different mythologies, religions, and spiritual practices. Each divine name carries a specific vibration, power, and symbolism, which can be invoked to connect with its associated deity or energy.

Answering the Challenge
Now that we have established an understanding of these three key concepts, let us delve into the process by which an individual's understanding and application of these principles can exhibit the union of their innate power with the Divine power of the gods, resulting in a transformative experience for both the individual and the collective consciousness.
**Step 1**: Developing Awareness and Understanding
The first step in this process is for the individual to develop a deep awareness and understanding of the principles of sacred geometry, astrological correspondences, and divine names. This can be achieved through the study of sacred texts, attending workshops or courses, joining spiritual communities, or seeking guidance from experienced teachers and mentors.
**Step 2**: Integrating Knowledge into Personal Practice
Once the individual has gained a solid foundation in these principles, they must integrate this knowledge into their personal spiritual practices. This can involve meditation, visualization, chanting, or incorporating sacred geometric designs and astrological symbols into their personal space or body in the form of tattoos, jewelry, or artwork.
**Step 3**: Cultivating a Direct Connection with the Divine
As the individual's understanding and application of these principles deepen, they begin to cultivate a direct connection with the divine energies associated with the gods, celestial bodies, and sacred geometric patterns. This can be experienced as a heightened sense of intuition, greater creative expression, or even the ability to tap into healing or psychic abilities.
**Step 4**: Union of Innate Power with Divine Power
Over time, through continued practice and application of these principles, the individual's innate power begins to merge with the divine energies they have been connecting with, resulting in a powerful transformative experience. This union exemplifies the merging of personal will and divine will, or the integration of the microcosm (the individual) with the macrocosm (the entirety of creation).
**Step 5**: Transformative Experience for the Individual and Collective Consciousness
As the individual's inner transformation deepens, they begin to naturally embody and radiate the divine energies they have become one with. This spiritual evolution can have profound ripple effects on the collective consciousness, as others are inspired to seek their own connection to the divine and experience similar transformations, ultimately raising the vibration of the entire human race.

Conclusion
In conclusion, an individual's understanding and application of sacred geometry principles, astrological correspondences, and divine names can exhibit the union of their innate power with the Divine power of the gods by following a journey of increased awareness, integration, and ultimately the merging of personal and divine energies. This transformative experience not only deeply impacts the individual but also contributes to the evolution of the collective consciousness, raising the vibrational frequency of humanity as a whole.
