  Compose an intricately woven hymn in honor of the moon goddess, Selene, detailing her celestial journey and invoking her divine feminine power to infuse each stanza with the energies that govern fertility and intuition. Through rhythmic meter and haunting melodies, invoke her protective lunar force to shine upon the sacred spaces of the night and awaken ancient mysteries within the hearts of humankind, illuminating their spiritual path and invoking the powerful synergy of both waxing and waning moons.

Verse 1:
Oh radiant Selene, goddess of the night,
In silver-shining chariot you take flight,
We sing your praise, your lunar temples gleaming,
Embrace nocturnal hearts, your light redeeming.

**Chorus**:
Goddess of the Moon, Selene divine,
With sacred power of fertility and intuition,
Guide our hearts and souls,
Illuminate our paths, let moonlight reign.

Verse 2:
You grace the heavens, your lunation guiding,
As waxing crescent, your bright face confiding,
With gibbous birth, we see your might ascending,
Celestial force untold, your reach extending.

**Chorus**:
Goddess of the Moon, Selene divine,
With sacred power of fertility and intuition,
Guide our hearts and souls,
Illuminate our paths, let moonlight reign.

Verse 3:
The Moon in full, a heavenly sphere now glows,
As ancient secrets of the night bestow,
Awaken mysteries deep within our minds,
Great Selene, your lunar force enshrines.

**Chorus**:
Goddess of the Moon, Selene divine,
With sacred power of fertility and intuition,
Guide our hearts and souls,
Illuminate our paths, let moonlight reign.

Verse 4:
Your waning face to constricting darkness yields,
Yet wisdom gained lies dormant in the fields,
Your subtle whispers nurture intuition,
As crescent dwindles, darkness overtakes its mission.

**Chorus**:
Goddess of the Moon, Selene divine,
With sacred power of fertility and intuition,
Guide our hearts and souls,
Illuminate our paths, let moonlight reign.

**Outro**:
Oh Selene, goddess pure, your cycle nears its end,
Your once-lit path, in darkness now descend,
But rest assured, your latent power shall rise,
The waxing moon, rebirth to energize.

Goddess of the Moon, Selene we call,
In sacred spaces, let your moonlight fall,
Awaken truth and light in humankind,
In cyclic synergy we'll forge our might.
