To create a multifaceted sigil that combines the celestial energies of Aphrodite, Lakshmi, and Ra, I have devised a trinity of interconnected divine glyphs.

Glyph 1 - Aphrodite (Eternal Love):
The first glyph is a stylized heart intertwined with a blooming rose, representing Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Its petals curve into delicate spirals that meet at a central point, symbolizing the merging of souls in eternal love. The petals themselves have gentle waves and points to represent the ever-changing nature of love and affection.

Glyph 2 - Lakshmi (Bountiful Prosperity):
The second glyph is an abstract representation of a blossoming lotus flower with a golden coin at its center, signifying Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune and prosperity. The lotus petals are symmetrically arranged in a circle around the coin, signifying balance and harmony in the acquisition and use of wealth. Each petal has a dot at its tip, representing a stable foundation for prosperity.

Glyph 3 - Ra (Spiritual Illumination):
The third glyph is a stylized sun disk, with beaming rays of light emanating from its core, representing Ra, the sun god and a symbol of spiritual illumination. Within the sun disk itself is the Eye of Ra, displaying the watchful and protecting presence of the god. The rays expand outward, indicating the enlightenment and spiritual growth bestowed upon the wielder.

Runic Sequence (Attraction and Protection):
Surrounding the trinity of glyphs is an ancient runic sequence incorporating the runes Feoh (wealth and success), Wynn (joy and love), and Eolh (protection and guidance). These runes create a continuous chain, connecting the sigil's energies and enhancing its resonance with the universal frequency of attraction.

The runic sequence acts as a protective barrier, shielding the wielder from any potential unwelcome energies or repercussions as they tap into the divine energies of the sigil.

Together, these divine glyphs and the integrated ancient runic sequence create a powerful sigil that magnetizes eternal love, bountiful prosperity, and spiritual illumination. The sigil can be used by those seeking to enhance these forms of energy in their life while safeguarding them from any unwanted influence.
