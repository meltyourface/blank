The Scarlet Woman, also known as Babalon, holds a central position in Jack Parsons' occult practices, in particular, his connection to Thelema and the Babalon Working ritual. As an essential figure in Aleister Crowley's religion, Thelema, the Scarlet Woman is considered the divine feminine principle and the embodiment of both erotic desire and spiritual liberation. This duality is observed through her depiction as a sensual woman and the personification of divine love.

In Thelema, the Scarlet Woman is associated with the Whore of Babylon, a character found in the Bible's Book of Revelation, representing the antithesis of the restricting moral order imposed by Christianity. Babalon is perceived as the ultimate liberator, who encourages individuals to embrace their true desires and innermost spiritual nature, shattering the chains of conventional morality and societal constraints.

Parsons' engagement with the concept of the Scarlet Woman largely evolved from his collaboration with Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). His interests in Thelema, esotericism, and sexual magic culminated in the Babalon Working ritual, which aimed to invoke the goddess Babalon on Earth, achieving a symbolic union of opposites and ultimately paving the way for a new era of spiritual enlightenment.

The Babalon Working ritual, carried out by Parsons and his friend, L. Ron Hubbard, involved a series of complicated magical rites and sexual rituals. Their goal was to impregnate a female participant, who would give birth to a child embodying the spirit of Babalon. This ethereal being, also referred to as the "Moonchild," was expected to play a pivotal role in guiding humanity into a new Aeon and liberate individuals from the limitations imposed by religious and societal norms.

Over time, Parsons had several partnerships and encounters with women he believed embodied the Scarlet Woman's archetype. Among the most notable was Marjorie Cameron, an artist, actress, and fellow Thelemite. Describing Cameron as the physical embodiment of Babalon, they bonded over their shared spiritual aspirations and romantic affections. Together, Parsons and Cameron pursued the enactment of Babalon Working, with Cameron acting as the human vessel for Babalon's manifestation on Earth. While many speculate whether an actual child was conceived or not, their collaborative efforts marked a significant turning point in Parsons' spiritual journey and his occult practice.

In conclusion, the Scarlet Woman represents a powerful symbol and practical catalyst within Jack Parsons' occult practices, rooted in the principles of Thelema and the Babalon Working ritual. She personifies the divine feminine principle, sensual desire, and spiritual liberation, pushing against the constraints of conventional morality. Jack Parson's involvement with individuals embodying the Scarlet Woman archetype, most notably Marjorie Cameron, marked a pivotal moment in his spiritual exploration and demonstrated the essential connection between esotericism, sexuality, and human transformation.
