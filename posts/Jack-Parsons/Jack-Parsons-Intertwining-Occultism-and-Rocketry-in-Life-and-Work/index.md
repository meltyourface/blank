Jack Parsons, born as Marvel Whiteside Parsons, was an American rocket engineer, chemist, and a prominent occultist. He was one of the founding members of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and a pioneer in the development of solid rocket propellant technology. In addition to his work in rocketry, Parsons was also an influential figure in occult circles, aligning himself with the mystical system of Thelema, which was established by famed British occultist Aleister Crowley.

Parsons' performance of the Babalon Working ritual is a significant event in his life that closely ties his occult beliefs with his scientific pursuits. The Babalon Working was an elaborate and complex set of magical rituals conducted by Parsons and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1946, intended to manifest the divine feminine force or the Thelemic goddess Babalon onto Earth. In Thelema, Babalon is the personification of the supreme feminine principle, representing both universal love and indulgence in earthly desires, seeking to destroy the restrictions of ego and liberate humanity from societal constraints.

The Babalon Working was heavily influenced by Thelema, with Parsons invoking numerous deities and key concepts from Crowley's work. For example, the ritual draws upon the concept of the Holy Guardian Angel, a divine being representing the perfected or higher self, and the related "Knowledge and Conversation" of this entity, which signifies the attainment of a heightened state of spiritual awareness. 

Parsons' personal correspondences with Crowley, which are well-documented, provide further insights into the connections between his occult and engineering practices. In one letter, Parsons refers to his work in rocket technology as an "art approaching the religious," revealing his belief in the interconnected nature of the spiritual and material worlds. His dedication to the Thelemic creed, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," inspired him to pursue his passions in both science and magick, striving to realize their unification.

Parsons' involvement in the Babalon Working had a profound impact on his life and connections within the esoteric and scientific communities. As a result of the ritual, he believed to have successfully manifested Marjorie Cameron, a fellow occultist and eventual wife, as the human embodiment of Babalon. Furthermore, the Babalon Working is said to have caused a rift between Parsons and Hubbard, who eventually parted ways with Parsons claiming that Hubbard had defrauded him.

Parsons' integration of Thelema and rocket engineering had a profound impact on his career. His pioneering work in rocket science attracted attention from prominent scientific figures, such as Robert H. Goddard and Theodore von Kármán, as well as earning him the nickname "the father of American rocketry."

Despite the controversy surrounding his personal life and occult beliefs, Parsons' contribution to the field of rocket science and propulsion technology is undeniable. His work at JPL and the development of solid rocket propellants laid the foundation for major advancements in space exploration, including the launch of the first American satellite, Explorer 1, and the Apollo moon missions.

In conclusion, Jack Parsons' life and work serve as a testament to the intricate interplay between esoteric beliefs and scientific pursuits. His performance of the Babalon Working ritual, adherence to Thelema, and groundbreaking achievements in rocket engineering reveal a complex portrait of a man driven by a deep-seated passion for both spiritual and material pursuits. Parsons' legacy continues to inspire and enlighten those interested in the intersection of the occult and the scientific realms.
