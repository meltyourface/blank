The obscure Latin neologism in question is "athanochrysosis." To decipher its etymological origins and linguistic components, we must dissect the term into roots, prefixes, and suffixes, as well as consider the historical evolution of the Latin language. 

The term "athanochrysosis" can be broken down into three primary constituents: "athan," "chrys," and "osis." Each of these components holds a specific meaning, further assisting in the construction of the word's overall meaning.

"Athan," or "athanatos," originates from the Greek language and means "immortal" or "deathless." This term connects to the eternal nature of the alchemical processes explored in the manuscript, as well as the philosophical quest for eternal life.

"Chrys," derived from the Greek "chrysos," meaning "golden" or "gold," is a recognizable term in different alchemical texts. The central objective of alchemy is the transmutation of base metals into gold. Thus, it is understandable that this term would be integrated into the Latin neologism.

The suffix "–osis" is derived from Latin, which signifies a condition or process. In medical terminology, "–osis" is often used to describe a disease or abnormal condition.

Considering the esoteric influences surrounding the term, it is critical to acknowledge the shared roots and ideas in ancient Greek and Roman philosophical thought, as they were deeply interwoven with the development of Latin alchemical literature.

Taking the thematic context of the medieval alchemical manuscript, the term "athanochrysosis" appears to relate directly to the process and pursuit of generating eternal life through alchemical means. With "athan" referring to immortality, "chrys" denoting gold as a symbol of achieving the highest state in alchemy, and "–osis" signifying a condition or process, the neologism's most likely interpretation is "the process or condition of attaining immortality through the transmutation of base metals into gold."

The term's discovery within an alchemical text denotes the connection between spiritual enlightenment and the physical process of transmutation. The text's overall message could imply a deeper philosophical subtext, suggesting the belief in the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom as an avenue to immortality. Moreover, the term's creation demonstrates the flexibility of Latin as a language and its bridging with Greek concepts, reflecting the age-old pursuit of understanding through the merging of diverse cultural, philosophical, and esoteric influences.

In conclusion, "athanochrysosis" unveils a critical aspect of medieval alchemical philosophy and practice. The term signifies the pursuit of immortality through transmutation, highlighting the intersection of ancient Greek and Roman thought, language, and culture within the realm of esoteric Latin literature.
