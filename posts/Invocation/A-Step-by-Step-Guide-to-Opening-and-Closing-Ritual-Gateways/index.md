Step-by-Step Guide to Opening and Closing an Invocational Gateway

1. Preparation of the ritual space:
To create a controlled environment, start by cleaning and organizing the space. Consecrate the area with a mixture of salt and water, sprinkling it around the perimeter. Use smudging tools such as white sage or palo santo to clear away negative energy, and use sound cleansing with bells or singing bowls. Finally, cast a protective circle around the ritual space using a wand, athame, or your hand while visualizing a sphere of protective energy.

2. Selection of appropriate sigils, symbols, and language:
Incorporate symbols of power and protection into the ritual, such as the pentacle or ankh. Use sigils representing the energies or entities you wish to invoke. When choosing the language for your invocation, opt for a language that resonates with the entity or energy being summoned, such as Enochian for angelic invocations. Combine sigils and symbols in a harmonious pattern around the ritual space, enhancing their power and influence.

3. Proper timing and alignments:
The opening and closing of the gateway should align with favorable astrological, lunar, and planetary influences. For example, perform the ritual during a new or full moon, or when the planets Mars and Venus are converging, to amplify the energy. Consult an ephemeris or astrological calendar for the most auspicious dates and times.

4. Preparation of the Invoker:
The invoker should meditate to focus and clarify their intentions prior to starting the ritual. Engage in energy attuning exercises like deep breathing, visualization, and grounding to increase personal power and energetic control. Wear a protective talisman or amulet, such as a necklace or ring with a protective sigil or symbol, to ensure safety throughout the ritual.

5. Execution of the vocalized Invocation:
Begin by reciting a chant to establish the ritual's purpose and set the stage for the invocation. Use repetitive mantras or rhythmic phrases to raise energy, such as "I invoke the power of [Entity or Energy] to join me in this sacred space." Recite specific invocations tailored to the entities or energies being summoned, emphasizing their qualities and attributes.

6. Maintenance of the invocational gateway:
During the ritual, maintain control over the energies or entities by asserting authority and setting boundaries. Use visualization techniques to guide and direct the summoned energy, and utilize tools, such as an athame or wand, to assist in directing energy. Ensure the ritual's integrity is protected by regularly cleansing the space and reinforcing the protective circle.

7. Closing and sealing the gateway:
When it's time to close the gateway, thank the energies or entities for their assistance and direct them to depart. Gradually diminish the energy by visualizing the gateway closing, and use a chant or mantra, such as "The gateway now closes, leaving only peace and harmony." Strengthen the protective circle and perform a closing rite, extinguishing any candles or incense used in the ritual.

8. Post-ritual practices:
After the gateway has been closed, ground excess energy by touching the earth or eating a light meal. Practice energy cleansing techniques, like taking a bath infused with salt, herbs, or essential oils, to purify your aura. Reflect on the experiences of the ritual in a journal, and perform any necessary follow-up work, such as divination or meditation.
