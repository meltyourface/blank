To craft a meticulously-designed herbal concoction to invoke and establish communion with a preselected supernatural entity, I will consider the entity's known preferences, vibrations, and associations along with the safety, control, and amplification of psychic reach during the process.

1. ****Preparation****: Begin by gathering information about the target entity. Research its associations â€“ element, color, plants, animals, and other symbols. Once you have gathered the information, select herbs that resonate with the being's vibration and preferences.

2. ****Selection of herbs****: Based on the research, choose 7-9 herbs that not only amplify psychic reach but also resonate with the entity. **For this example, I'll assume our target entity is associated with the earth element, the color green, and the animals crow, wolf, and serpent. Some potential herbs to consider include**:

- Mugwort (for psychic vision)
- Wormwood (as an offering to spirits)
- Patchouli (for grounding and earth connection)
- Damiana (for enhancing spiritual visions)
- Sage (for cleansing and protection)
- Frankincense (for spiritual elevation)
- Mandrake (for deep connection with the spirit realm)
- Yarrow (for protection and courage in interacting with spirits)
- Juniper berries (for purification and protection)

3. ****Experimenting with proportions and synergies****: Start with a base blend of equal parts of the selected herbs. **For instance**:

- 2 parts Mugwort
- 1 part Wormwood 
- 1 part Patchouli
- 1 part Damiana
- 1 part Sage
- 1 part Frankincense 
- 1 part Mandrake 
- 1 part Yarrow
- 1 part Juniper berries

4. ****Crafting the blend****: Crush the herbs in a mortar and pestle while focusing on your intention, to establish a communion with the target entity. Take your time, blending with purpose, and chanting an invocation or affirmation to imbue your blend with your intentions.

5. ****Testing and refining the blend****: Place a small amount of the herbal concoction in a fire-safe container and light it with a pure intention, inhaling the fragrance and using a ritualistic method such as astral projection, meditation, or scrying to attempt to establish a connection to the entity. Based on the results, adjust the proportions or herbs if needed, and then test and refine again until you achieve optimal potency.

6. ****Storing the blend****: Store the herbal concoction in an airtight container, preferably made of glass or a material that won't react with the herbs, and keep it in a cool, dark place to preserve its freshness and potency.

Throughout this process, prioritize safety and control by maintaining proper grounding and protective measures. The meticulously-designed herbal concoction will become an indispensable tool in invoking and establishing communion with the preselected supernatural entity, increasing the likelihood of a vivid, interactive encounter.
