The knowledge challenge at hand demands an extensive exploration of various aspects related to Spellwork, including: the historical foundations in Hermeticism, energetic alignment of the practitioner, correspondences' role in shaping a cohesive spell, and the implications of the Law of Return (also known as the Threefold Law). Throughout this analysis, we shall decipher the keys to an effective and ethical approach to Spellwork.

Historical Principles of Hermeticism:
Hermeticism is a philosophical, mystical, and religious tradition that originates from Hellenistic Egypt. It is based primarily on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, who is considered the founder of the Hermetic arts, such as alchemy, astrology, and magic. The teachings of Hermeticism emphasize the goal of achieving spiritual and material unity with the divine. This unity is encapsulated within the principle of "As above, so below," reflecting the belief that the microcosm (individual) and macrocosm (universe) are mirror images of one another.

Energetic Alignment of the Practitioner:
Given the interconnectedness between the macrocosm and microcosm, energetic alignment plays a crucial role in successful spellwork. The practitioner's internal harmony, wisdom, and understanding impact their ability to create effective spells. A well-rounded practitioner is one that acknowledges the importance of internal balance; refining their physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual facets to enhance their manifestation abilities. The practitioner's alignment also impacts their ethical considerations within magic, as it exemplifies the necessity for self-awareness, self-mastery, and discernment.

Role of Correspondences in Crafting a Cohesive Spell:
Correspondences serve as the building blocks for constructing a cohesive spell by offering symbolic and energetic connections between various elements. These connections might include colors, crystals, plants, celestial bodies, and so forth, which hold specific and unique energies. The method of establishing correspondences draws upon the Hermetic axiom "As above, so below," and thus, finding relatedness between the various elements and the desired result creates harmony that empowers a spell. Correspondences not only strengthen the potency of a spell, but they also encourage the practitioner to delve into the esoteric understanding of the elements and their interconnected nature, fostering growth and wisdom in the process.

Implications of the Law of Return (Threefold Law) on Effectiveness and Ethical Concerns:
The Law of Return, or the Threefold Law, is a principle asserting that the energy one puts forth, whether positive or negative, will return to the practitioner threefold. **This law inevitably impacts both the effectiveness of the spell and the ethical ramifications of the caster's intentions. Ethically, the Threefold Law encourages the practitioner to reflect on their intentions and ensure they do not harm others or themselves. The consideration of this law aligns with the Wiccan Rede's central tenet**: "An it harm none, do what ye will."

Furthermore, understanding and respecting the Law of Return influences the efficacy of spellwork; as it encompasses the notion of intention, awareness, and responsibility, it directly influences the energetic alignment of the practitioner. By considering the possible consequences and ensuring the intentions are pure, the practitioner bolsters their energetic alignment, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of their spells.

To summarize, crafting a cohesive, effective, and ethical spell in the realm of occult Spellwork involves understanding and implementing the historical principles of Hermeticism, acknowledging the significance of the practitioner's energetic alignment, valuing the role of correspondences in shaping the spell, and thoroughly analyzing the implications of the Law of Return on the caster's intentions and Spellwork. By engaging in a multifaceted and introspective approach to magic, the practitioner can manifest spells that serve the greater good and bring them closer to unity with the divine.
