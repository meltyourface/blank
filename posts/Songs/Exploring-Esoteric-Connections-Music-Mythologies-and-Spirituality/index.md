In order to respond to this knowledge challenge, we must delve into various interconnected fields: ancient mythologies, music theory, and spiritual practices. **Let us first explain the three main aspects of the question**:

1. **The retelling of ancient mythologies in songs**: Mythologies from various ancient civilizations, such as Greek, Norse, and Egyptian, have long been the subject of countless songs, poems, and art pieces. They often serve as a cache of metaphorical wisdom and archetypes and help communicate powerful insights and teachings about the human condition, spirituality, and the nature of reality.

2. **Vocal and instrumental frequencies**: Music is a universal language that has the power to move people emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. The frequencies of sound generated through vocals and instruments can create a harmonious resonance or dissonance that can impact the listener's state of mind.

3. **Spiritual enlightenment or altered states of consciousness**: This refers to the experiences through which practitioners perceive and engage with reality in ways different from their ordinary states of consciousness. It may involve the expansion of one's consciousness, transcending the ego, or attaining a sense of oneness with the universe.

Now, with a clearer understanding of these aspects, let us explore the esoteric connection between them.

The esoteric connection between ancient mythologies retold through songs and spiritual states begins with the fundamental role of music as an expressive medium. Music, as a non-verbal form of storytelling, transmutes these ancient narratives into vibrations that directly communicate with the listener's emotional and spiritual faculties. Moreover, various cultural and spiritual traditions have employed specific scales, modes, and tunings to convey certain emotions or energies. For instance, the ancient Greeks used modes like the Dorian and Phrygian to invoke a sense of sorrow or spiritual longing.

The retelling of mythologies in song essentially "codes" the wisdom, archetypes, and universal themes within the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structures of the music. As a result, the listeners' subconscious and unconscious minds can tune into these encoded messages, bypassing the analytical faculties of the conscious mind. They may experience remarkable insights, emotional catharsis, or an enhanced sense of connection to the story being told.

When investigating the relationship between vocal and instrumental frequencies and spiritual experiences, we must examine the concept of resonance. In music, sympathetic resonance occurs when a vibrating object causes another object to vibrate at its frequency. This principle applies not only to physical objects but also to the listener's emotional and energetic states. When the frequencies of the music align with particular energetic or emotional states, they can induce resonance within the listener, potentially leading to profound spiritual experiences or altered states.

For example, some research suggests that certain frequencies, such as 432 Hz (in contrast to the today's standard of 440 Hz), are more harmonious with the human body and the natural world, which could promote healing, balance, or spiritual growth.

To summarize, the esoteric connection between ancient mythologies in songs, their corresponding vocal and instrumental frequencies, and the ability to facilitate spiritual enlightenment or altered states of consciousness, can be understood through the following key themes:

1. The non-verbal, expressive power of music to transmit wisdom and teachings from ancient mythologies.
2. The role of specific scales, modes, and tunings to convey emotional and spiritual energies.
3. The concept of resonance, creatively employed between the musical frequencies and the listener's emotional and energetic states, to induce transformative spiritual experiences.

Ultimately, when one skillfully combines the retelling of ancient mythologies through music and the proper utilization of vocal and instrumental frequencies, it is indeed possible to facilitate the practitioner's journey toward spiritual enlightenment or altered states of consciousness.
