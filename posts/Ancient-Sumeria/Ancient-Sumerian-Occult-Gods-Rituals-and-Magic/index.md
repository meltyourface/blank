## Occult Practices in Ancient Sumeria

Introduction

The occult practices of Ancient Sumeria are deeply rooted in the religious and cultural beliefs of the Sumerians, one of the oldest civilizations known to mankind. The Sumerians resided in the Mesopotamian region, which roughly corresponds to modern-day Iraq, around 4500 BC. This section will delve into the beliefs, rituals, deities, magical symbols, and practices that defined the Sumerian occult system. Knowledge of these ancient traditions can provide valuable insights into the magical practices that spread across the world since the dawn of human civilization.

Beliefs and Rituals

Sumerian occult practices were an integral part of the people's daily lives, serving as a connection to the divine. The Sumerians believed in a pantheon of gods, who controlled the forces of nature and the cosmos. Their magical rituals and spells were performed to evoke the power of these gods and to manipulate the natural world to their benefit.

Temples and ziggurats were built to pay homage to the gods and to serve as places to carry out rituals and offerings. Priests, priestesses, and other members of the society initiated in the occult would perform rites for healing, protection, divine communication, and blessings. These rituals involved a combination of chanting, dancing, offerings, and other ceremonial acts. The specific steps of a ritual depended on the deity it was performed for and the desired outcome.

Gods and Goddesses

The Sumerians worshipped a variety of gods and goddesses, each representing different aspects in the natural and spiritual realms. While there are many deities in the Sumerian pantheon, some of the significant ones in terms of occult practices include:

1. Anu: The supreme god, the ruler of the heavens, and the god of kingship. Priests would invoke Anu to maintain cosmic order and bestow divine authority over people.

2. Enlil: The god of air and storms, who held the Tablets of Destiny. Enlil was considered responsible for providing covenant and prosperity to the people.

3. Inanna/Ishtar: The goddess of love, fertility, and war. Inanna was invoked for protection, love, success in battles, and to communicate with the spirit world. The sacred marriage ritual, or hieros gamos, was performed annually to ensure agricultural fertility.

4. Enki/Ea: The god of wisdom, water, and creation. Enki was the keeper of the divine powers called "me," which governed various aspects of existence. He was known for his cunning nature and was invoked for the acquisition of knowledge, protection against demons, and for healing.

Magical Symbols and Practices

Sumerian magic relied on the belief in the power of words, names, and geometric shapes. They believed specific sounds, words, and names had inherent power, which could be harnessed to manifest reality. The cuneiform script, the first known system of writing, was central to expressing their magical knowledge. Certain magical symbols, called sigils, were common in Sumerian occult practices. These sigils, often derived from the names of gods or the forces they controlled, played a vital role in rituals, amulets, and inscriptions to call forth divine power.

Sumerian magic made use of various forms of divination, such as astrology, dreams, liver omens, and more. Astrology was seen as a way to understand the will of the gods, and dreams were considered messages from the divine. Liver divination, a popular Sumerian practice called "extispicy," was used to predict the outcome of events by examining the entrails of sacrificial animals.

Evidence of Sumerian Magic

Sumerian magic can be traced through various artifacts, texts, and historical events. One such artifact is the Burney Relief, a terracotta plaque dated around 1800 BC, depicting the goddess Inanna with owls and lions as her symbols. Additionally, the Sumerian incantation texts, such as the Maql√ª text, provide an extensive understanding of the spells and rituals employed by the priests.

In conclusion, the occult practices in Ancient Sumeria were sophisticated and elaborate, encapsulating a rich and diverse spiritual system. As the foundation of human civilization, the Sumerian magical system offers profound insights into the evolution of occult beliefs and practices across millennia. By studying these primary sources, we may delve deeper into understanding the magical knowledge that transcends time.
