The Sumerian mythological tale "Enki and the World Order" presents a rich tapestry of symbols and motifs intricately woven together to reflect the complexities of Sumerian society and its understanding of the cosmos. To fully grasp the significance of this myth, we must first appreciate its relation to the Sumerian pantheon, the importance of water and fertility, and the development of the early civilization. By analyzing these elements' convergence within the narrative, we can gain invaluable insights into Sumerian ideals and their perception of the world. 

1. The Sumerian Pantheon:
The Sumerian pantheon was characterized by an array of deities who personified different aspects of the natural world and human life. At the center of this myth is Enki, the god of creation, knowledge, and wisdom, whose role in the world order is paramount. Enki is portrayed as the organizer and distributor of various functions and responsibilities to other deities, thereby ensuring the smooth functioning of the cosmos.

In the tale, Enki assigns roles to deities such as Inanna, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, and Utu, the sun god responsible for ensuring justice. This process of assigning roles underscores the hierarchical and interconnected nature of the Sumerian pantheon, where each deity plays a crucial part in the maintenance of cosmic harmony.

2. The Importance of Water and Fertility:
The significance of water and fertility in the "Enki and the World Order" tale cannot be overstated. Enki, by virtue of being the god of freshwaters, abzu (subterranean waters), and the life-giving Tigris and Euphrates rivers, has a fundamental role in the myth. The story details how Enki filled the Tigris and Euphrates rivers with life-giving waters, in turn ensuring the fertility of the land and the success of agriculture and animal husbandry.

Additionally, the tale also highlights the significance of fertility in relation to certain deities, such as Inanna and Nanshe. Inanna is bestowed the responsibility of controlling marital and sexual unions, while Nanshe is given authority over fisheries and fertility of the marshland. By situating these deities within the narrative, the myth emphasizes the central role of water and fertility in the Sumerian worldview.

3. The Development of Early Civilization:
The "Enki and the World Order" myth also reflects the development and organization of early Sumerian civilization. Key themes such as the establishment of laws, the delineation of borders, and the formation of cities and temples all manifest within the story. Enki is portrayed as the wisdom-giving deity who bestows kingship and ensures the correct exercise of power in accordance with divine rules and regulations.

The creation and organization of a functioning world order, as depicted in the myth, can be seen as an allegory for the formation and establishment of early Sumerian society. The tale hints at the necessity of a harmonious balance between the spiritual and physical realms, as well as the importance of divine guidance in humans' pursuit of establishing and maintaining a functioning civilization.

In conclusion, the Sumerian mythological tale "Enki and the World Order" serves as an integrative narrative that weaves together diverse aspects of Sumerian culture, such as their pantheon, the role of water and fertility, and the development of a structured society. By assigning specific roles and responsibilities to individual deities, the myth establishes a hierarchy within the pantheon, illustrating how each god contributes to maintaining the cosmic order. Furthermore, the emphasis on water and fertility underscores the fundamental importance of these elements in sustaining life and ensuring a prosperous civilization. Lastly, through the depiction of Enki as the architect of divine rule, the tale signifies the pivotal role of the gods in guiding human affairs and shaping the course of human history.

Key themes from this analysis reveal the interconnectedness and interdependence of the Sumerian pantheon, the central role of water and fertility in sustaining civilization, and the need for divine order and regulation in crafting a harmonious society. From these insights, we can better understand the Sumerians' holistic perception of the world, in which both human and divine agents worked together to contribute to the cosmos' stability and prosperity.
