To fully respond to the challenge of analyzing the roles of Anunnaki deities Enlil, Enki, and Inanna in Ancient Sumerian mythology, we must first begin by comprehending the foundational aspects of the mythological context, delving into each deity's attributes and functions, and ultimately connecting these aspects to the broader themes of cosmic order, knowledge, power, and their implications for Sumerian society and governance.

The Anunnaki, translated as "those who from heaven to earth came," were a group of gods within the Sumerian pantheon. They played crucial roles in shaping the Sumerian understanding of the cosmos, life, and civilization. Three of the most renowned deities among the Anunnaki were Enlil, Enki, and Inanna, who held authority over different domains and possessed unique attributes that contributed to the broader cosmological themes of the time.

1. Enlil: The God of Wind, Destiny, and Kingship
Enlil, one of the most powerful gods in the Sumerian pantheon, is associated with wind, storms, and the air. He was considered the supreme ruler of earth and humanity, holding the Tablets of Destiny, which contained the decrees and determinations of the fates of all beings. Enlil was responsible for the separation of heaven and earth, an act that brought about cosmic order.

Additionally, Enlil had a significant role in governance. As "the King of all the Lands," he had the authority to choose which human rulers would be the legitimate leaders of Sumerian city-states, effectively ensuring that the kingship and authority were divinely sanctioned. In this way, Enlil contributed to maintaining order in society by providing legitimacy through divine approval.

2. Enki: The God of Wisdom, Creation, and Fresh Water
Enki, commonly associated with water, crafts, knowledge, and wisdom, played the role of a creator god in Sumerian mythology. His capacity for wisdom and problem-solving made him a vital deity in driving progress, innovation, and helping humans survive various challenges.

Perhaps his most significant contribution to the Sumerian mythos is the creation of humanity. According to the myth, Enki, with the help of his consort Ninhursag, designed human beings from clay as a workforce to serve the gods and aid them in the maintenance of the earth. Interestingly, Enki also patronized the art of writing, reflecting his connection to the concept of knowledge and the dissemination of information. 

3. Inanna: Goddess of Love, Fertility, and War
Also known as Ishtar in Akkadian mythology, Inanna is a multifaceted deity representing love, beauty, sex, fertility, and war. Inanna often showcased her exceptional power through strength, cunning, and determination. Additionally, she held considerable political influence, especially in the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, where she was considered the divine patron.

Her significance in promoting fertility and love accentuated the importance of reproduction, the continuity of human life, and maintaining social cohesion, while her association with war symbolized the necessary protective force required to defend and govern a civilization. As a multifaceted deity who could bring both prosperity and destruction, Inanna played a critical role in understanding the need to balance these forces in Sumerian society and governance.

Now let us consider the key themes of cosmic order, knowledge, and power, and their implications for Sumerian society and governance:

Cosmic Order:
Each deity played essential roles in maintaining cosmic order. Enlil's separation of heaven and earth and his connection to the Tablets of Destiny demonstrate his responsibility for establishing and preserving the fundamental order of the universe. Enki's creation of humanity contributes to the cosmic order by populating the earth and instituting a form of divine control over human life. Lastly, Inanna's dual aspects of love and war exhibit the necessity of balancing opposing forces to ensure the harmonious continuation of life.

Knowledge:
Enki, being the god of wisdom and the patron of writing, directly influenced the dissemination and acquisition of knowledge in Sumerian society. In this context, his role as a creator of humanity can also be viewed as the ultimate act of imparting knowledge â€“ the very act of bringing sentient beings into existence. The advancements in technology, agriculture, and administration that characterized Sumerian civilization could be directly attributed to the involvement of Enki and the inherent desire for obtaining knowledge.

Power:
Enlil's power was supremely authoritative, holding the power to establish kings and ensuring divine legitimacy in governance. Inanna, the formidable goddess of war, embodied the protection and martial capability needed to maintain political power. It is clear that both religion and politics were inextricably linked, paving the way for a civilization that believed in the divine origin of their rulers and the importance of maintaining order through the influence of their pantheon.

In summary, the roles of Anunnaki deities Enlil, Enki, and Inanna in Ancient Sumerian mythology showcase the rich fabric of cosmological understanding that shaped the Sumerian civilization. It is through their multifaceted attributes, domains, and functions that we can recognize their links to cosmic order, knowledge, and power. Ultimately, their contributions informed and propagated the structure and legitimacy of Sumerian society, shaping its worldview, governing principles, and appreciation of divine order.
