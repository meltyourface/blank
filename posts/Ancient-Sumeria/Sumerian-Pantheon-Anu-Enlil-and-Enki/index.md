The answer is: The Sumerian pantheon of gods, which included An, Enlil, and Enki.

The Ancient Sumerians were one of the earliest civilizations and had a profound impact on the development of human society and our understanding of the supernatural realm. Their pantheon of gods, which included An, Enlil, and Enki, played a central role in their religious beliefs and practices. These gods held various roles within the Sumerian cosmology, serving as the primary figures responsible for the creation of humanity, the maintenance of the world, and the enforcement of cosmic order.

An, also known as Anu, was considered the highest god and the 'father of the gods.' He ruled over the heavens and was associated with wisdom, authority, and the divine. Enlil, as the god of wind and storms, held significant power over nature and the elements, with the ability to either provide life-giving rains or unleash destructive forces. Enki, also known as Ea, was the god of water, wisdom, and magic, playing a vital role in human creation and the development of civilization.

The triad of An, Enlil, and Enki formed the core of the Sumerian pantheon, but their belief system also included numerous other deities, each of whom governed specific aspects of the world and human life. These gods and goddesses were believed to hold the power to impact the lives of individuals and shape societal events, influencing everything from agriculture to warfare.

Beyond the importance of the pantheon itself, other elements of Sumerian occult practices contributed to their knowledge of the supernatural realm. The use of magical amulets and talismans was an essential aspect of their religious practices, providing protection or assistance in various endeavors. These items often featured symbols, images, or inscriptions representing the gods or other powerful entities, invoking their power to achieve desired outcomes.

Additionally, the development of cuneiform writing – one of the world's first writing systems – allowed the Sumerians to document and share their esoteric knowledge across generations. This system of writing facilitated the spread of religious texts, mythological stories, and specialized knowledge about the gods, enhancing the depth and complexity of their supernatural understanding.

Lastly, the Sumerian concept of the me cannot be understated in its significance. The me were divine decrees that governed the cosmos and human society, imbuing the gods with their roles and powers. Adherence to the me was seen as essential for ensuring cosmic and societal balance, thus adding weight to the importance of the Sumerian gods in everyday life.

In conclusion, while all of these factors played a role in the development of Ancient Sumerian occult practices, the pantheon of gods – including An, Enlil, and Enki – was the most critical element in shaping their beliefs and providing deep insights into their understanding of the supernatural realm. The other aspects, such as magical amulets, cuneiform writing, and the concept of the me, supported and complemented the central role of the gods, creating a comprehensive, interconnected belief system that spanned multiple dimensions of Sumerian life.
