- Blood Scrying: Divination practice involving the interpretation of patterns in blood, often procured from oneself, sacrificial animals, or the environment.
- Blood Bonding: A powerful communion with the spirits or deities via offering blood to establish a connection and receive guidance or blessings.

### 1.3 Significance within Occult Practices
