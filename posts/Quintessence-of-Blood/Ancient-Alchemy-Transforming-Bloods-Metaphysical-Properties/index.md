In answering this knowledge challenge, we shall continuously draw upon, interrelate, and thoroughly expound upon the following concepts: the metaphysical properties of the Quintessence of Blood, the esoteric implications of the alchemic process of sanguinary transmutation, and the concept of spiritual transformation in various ancient traditions. We will subsequently demonstrate the interplay between these components to disclose the hidden mysteries and wisdom concerning the essence and potency of blood.

1. **The Metaphysical Properties of the Quintessence of Blood**:

The Quintessence of Blood represents the purest and most concentrated form of the vital life force inherent in living beings. As a metaphysical concept, it extends beyond mere biological or chemical processes, signifying an essential and immaterial essence endowed with transcendent qualities. This idea can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy, particularly Aristotle's concept of Aether or Quintessence, which he regarded as the fifth element ('Panchamahabhuta') that permeates all matter and exists in perfect harmony with the other four elements – earth, water, air, and fire.

In esoteric traditions, blood is considered to be the seat of the soul and the medium that facilitates an individual's psychic and spiritual development. It serves as a conduit, connecting the physical and ethereal realms, and embodies the quintessential alchemical principle of "As above, so below."

2. **The Esoteric Implications of the Alchemic Process of Sanguinary Transmutation**:

Alchemical sanguinary transmutation refers to the transformative process through which the Quintessence of Blood becomes purified, distilled, and amplified in order to access and manipulate its latent metaphysical properties. **This process can be illustrated through the following stages**: 

a) Nigredo: The initial stage of the alchemical process, during which the practitioner recognizes and confronts the impurities and imperfections in their own essence, the same way the base material is purified and broken down into its simplest form.

b) Albedo: The intermediate stage of purification where the practitioner experiences a spiritual cleansing and awakening through the refining of the quintessential energies and merging of opposites, resulting in a harmonious balance between light and darkness.

c) Rubedo: The final stage, culminating in the attainment of the Philosopher's Stone or Elixir of Life, which symbolizes spiritual enlightenment, self-realization, and cosmic oneness with the divine source.

3. **The Concept of Spiritual Transformation in Various Ancient Traditions**:

The pursuit of spiritual transformation through various divine and mystical practices has been a common theme across numerous ancient cultures and religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and Sufism, among others. Despite the differences in their practices, all these traditions share an inherent belief in the possibility of attaining spiritual illumination, wisdom, and transcendence through personal growth, sacrifice, and the pursuit of inner alchemy.

In this context, the Quintessence of Blood becomes the elemental foundation and conduit for spiritual transformation. It symbolizes the essence of life – both physical and spiritual – and encompasses both mortality and immortality, darkness and light, creation and destruction.

Interplay Between the Components:

By examining the connections between the metaphysical properties of the Quintessence of Blood, the esoteric implications of the alchemic process of sanguinary transmutation, and the concept of spiritual transformation in various ancient traditions, we can identify an intricate web of interrelation that discloses the deeper mysteries and wisdom concerning the essence and potency of blood.

Through the transformative process of sanguinary transmutation, the Quintessence of Blood becomes the catalyst for the realization and manifestation of spiritual advancement and transcendence. It encapsulates the concept of spiritual transformation and interweaves it with the esoteric knowledge and symbolic language of alchemy, ultimately providing a fundament for a holistic understanding of the human experience and the interconnectedness of all life.

In conclusion, the interplay between these components contributes to a cohesive and profound comprehension of the mysteries and wisdoms surrounding the essence and potency of blood. The metaphysical properties of the Quintessence of Blood signify its inherent spiritual import, its connection to the alchemic process highlights the transformative potential embedded within it, and its alignment with the concept of spiritual transformation in various ancient traditions emphasizes the universality and timeless relevance of this esoteric wisdom.
