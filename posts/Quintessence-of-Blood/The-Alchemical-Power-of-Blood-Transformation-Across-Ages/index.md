To comprehensively respond to this knowledge challenge, we will break down the answer into three primary sections: 1) discussing the metaphysical properties of the Quintessence of Blood, 2) exploring the esoteric implications of the alchemic process of sanguinary transmutation, and 3) examining the concept of spiritual transformation in various ancient traditions. 

1. The Metaphysical Properties of the Quintessence of Blood

In the realm of the esoteric and occult, the Quintessence of Blood represents the most refined and purest form of blood. This substance is believed to embody the essence of life, vitality, and enlightenment. Legends and mystical texts often suggest that this elixir has the transformative power to bestow immortality, rejuvenation, and profound spiritual insights upon those who can access and harness its energies.

To understand the significance of the Quintessence of Blood, we must first grasp the concept of quintessence itself. Quintessence can be defined as the fifth and purest element, transcending the traditional earthly elements of fire, air, water, and earth. The belief in quintessence, as the subtle essence permeating existence, has been a recurring theme in various metaphysical and alchemical traditions. Thus, the Quintessence of Blood can be regarded as a symbol of the unification of the material and the spiritual, the microcosm and the macrocosm, and the visible and the invisible.

2. The Alchemic Process of Sanguinary Transmutation

Sanguinary transmutation is an alchemical process wherein the blood and its transformative powers are employed to achieve spiritual advancement and inner alchemical metamorphosis. From ancient times to the Renaissance, alchemists worldwide have been intrigued by this enigmatic process, viewing it as a pathway to unlocking hidden wisdom, spiritual enlightenment, and immortality.

In the alchemical context, transmutation represents the transformative process where base metals, such as lead, are turned into precious metals, like gold, thus symbolizing the purging of spiritual impurities and the liberation of the soul from its material constraints. The sanguinary transmutation, wherein blood serves as the alchemical catalyst, implies that the sacred life force within blood plays a vital role in facilitating the ultimate metamorphosis necessary for spiritual enlightenment and transcendence. 

3. Spiritual Transformation in Various Ancient Traditions

- Egyptian: The ancient Egyptians believed in the divine powers of the blood and associated it with the life force bestowing another lease of life in the afterlife.
