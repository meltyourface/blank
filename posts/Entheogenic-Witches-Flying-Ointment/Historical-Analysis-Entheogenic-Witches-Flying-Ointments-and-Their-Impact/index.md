In order to complete the task, I have gathered and examined an extensive range of primary sources: historical texts, firsthand accounts, and scholarly journals, to delve into the vivid entheogenic experiences and altered states of consciousness specifically attributed to the application and use of Entheogenic Witches' 'Flying Ointments' throughout history. Here is a summary of my findings.

1. Reported Effects:
Many firsthand accounts and historical texts describe the use of Entheogenic Witches' 'Flying Ointments' as causing sensations of flying, shape-shifting, and vivid hallucinations. Users have reported entering trance-like states, experiencing intense visionary journeys, and gaining insights into hidden realms or knowledge. Additionally, several sources attest to the aphrodisiac and sedative properties of these ointments.

2. Ingredients:
Various primary sources mention a range of ingredients, some more commonly featured than others, including but not limited to:
- Belladonna (Deadly Nightshade)
- Henbane
- Mandrake
- Datura (Jimsonweed)
- Aconite (Wolfsbane)
- Opium Poppy
- Ergot-infected cereal grains
- Mugwort
- Wormwood
- Oils and animal fats (to act as a carrier for the active ingredients)

3. Preparation Methods:
Preparation methods found in historical texts and firsthand accounts involve blending the potent, often toxic, botanical ingredients with oils or animal fats to create a smooth, viscous mixture. Some sources mention the addition of ashes or soot to further darken the ointment. These mixtures were then applied to the body, most commonly to the genitals, armpits, or the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, to allow for rapid absorption into the bloodstream.

4. Recurring Patterns and Discrepancies:
A recurring pattern in the primary sources is the combination of powerful, potentially lethal ingredients in the recipes for the Flying Ointments. The substances most frequently mentioned are Belladonna, Henbane, Mandrake, and Datura, all of which contain tropane alkaloids that can induce powerful hallucinations and altered states of consciousness.

Discrepancies can be found in the proportion of ingredients to be used and the actual recipes, likely due to differences in regional availability, cultural practices, and the desired effects.

5. Cultural and Societal Impact:
Entheogenic Witches' 'Flying Ointments' played a significant role in the practice of witchcraft and esoteric traditions across Europe, particularly during the medieval period and Renaissance. These ointments not only influenced people's perception of witches and their abilities but also contributed to powerful folklore. The testimonies of those accused of witchcraft often included descriptions of using such ointments to fly or transform, thus further fueling societal fear during times of persecution. 

In conclusion, my analysis of primary sources related to Entheogenic Witches' 'Flying Ointments' has shed light on the reported effects, ingredients, preparation methods, recurring patterns, discrepancies, and cultural impacts associated with these mystical concoctions. These potent mixtures have left a lasting legacy on both the practice of witchcraft and the shaping of Western esotericism throughout history.
