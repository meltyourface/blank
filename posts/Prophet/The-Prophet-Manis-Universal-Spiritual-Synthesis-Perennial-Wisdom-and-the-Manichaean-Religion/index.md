To fully address this knowledge challenge, I will focus on the esoteric principle of the "perennial wisdom" and its manifestation in the life and teachings of the historical prophet Mani, whose prophetic message led to the formation of the Manichaean religion and brought about a significant transformation in the societies where it emerged.

Perennial wisdom, also known as perennial philosophy, refers to the esoteric belief that there is an underlying truth that transcends all religious and spiritual traditions, a truth which manifests itself in various forms based on time and place. Proponents of this principle teach that this truth is eternal and universal, and can be found at the core of all religious systems.

Mani (216-274 CE), the founder of the Manichaean religion, was a prophet born in Mesopotamia, within the Sassanian Empire (modern-day Iran). Drawing from diverse religious traditions including Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Buddhism, Mani sought to create a syncretic belief system, blending elements of these faiths into a coherent whole. 

Mani's prophetic mission began with a series of spiritual experiences, during which he claimed to have received divine revelations from his celestial twin or higher self. Mani held a profound belief in the duality of forces (light and darkness) at play in the world, and saw his role as a mediator between these forces, tasked with guiding humanity towards salvation. He believed that his teachings were tantamount to the "perennial wisdom," a synthesis of all religions which revealed the universal truths that lay at their core.

As part of his mission, Mani composed several mystical texts, such as the Shabuhragan and the Book of Giants, in which he encoded and disseminated his prophetic revelations. **Mani believed that, due to the esoteric nature of his teachings, only a select few initiates would fully comprehend their inner meanings. The Manichaean community was thus divided into two main groups**: the "elect," who were spiritually advanced, and the "hearers" who were the ordinary followers. The elect were responsible for transmitting the teachings to the hearers, who would then commit to moral and ethical conduct, striving to gradually attain the spiritual level of the elect through personal transformation and ascetic practices.

Mani's syncretism and his emphasis on the "perennial wisdom" facilitated the spread of Manichaeism throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, and even parts of Europe and China. The religion found its most significant following among diverse populations as they could all see elements of their specific cultural understandings of spirituality embedded within Maniâ€™s prophetic teachings. This facilitated a transformative effect on these societies, as various faiths such as Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Buddhism found points of contact and reconciliation in the universal truths he espoused.

In conclusion, the esoteric principle of the "perennial wisdom" played a significant role in the prophetic message and life of Mani. As a historic prophet, Mani sought to reveal the universal truths within diverse religious traditions, thereby merging them into a coherent spiritual path. His unconventional methods of disseminating his teachings, aimed at a select few initiates, fostered the initiation and transformation of his followers. Ultimately, Mani's syncretic approach contributed to the widespread transformation of the societies in which his ideas took root, by fostering understanding, dialogue, and harmony between different religious beliefs through their shared eternals truths.
