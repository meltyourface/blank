To properly examine and understand the multifaceted connections and underlying significance between the demon Asmodeus, his attribution to the Deadly Sin of Lust, his role in the grimoire the Lesser Key of Solomon, and his appearance in the apocryphal Book of Tobit, we need to delve into the following aspects:

1. Historical and mythological origins of Asmodeus
2. Asmodeus and the Deadly Sin of Lust
3. The Lesser Key of Solomon and Asmodeus
4. The Book of Tobit and Asmodeus
5. Broader implications on understanding demonic personages within the context of both the Judeo-Christian tradition and Western occultism

1. **Historical and mythological origins of Asmodeus**:

Asmodeus, also known as Ashmedai, is a powerful and malevolent demon originating from ancient Persia in Zoroastrianism, where he appears as a demon of lust, rage, and destruction. In Jewish mythology, he later became known as the 'king of demons' and is mostly associated with the Book of Tobit. Within the context of Christian demonology, Asmodeus is seen as a powerful demon presiding over various indulgences and represents the deadly sin of lust.

2. **Asmodeus and the Deadly Sin of Lust**:

In Christian theology, the concept of the Seven Deadly Sins became popularized during the early days of the Church, as a way to recognize and categorize major vices that could lead to further sin and moral corruption. Asmodeus is typically associated with the sin of lust, representing sexual desire and indulgence taken to an obsessive and destructive level. Lust is one of the most powerful of all human emotions, and the profound allure of its temptations plays a part in Asmodeus' ability to manipulate and corrupt humanity. He not only embodies the sin of lust but actively seeks to promote it within the human psyche, thus increasing his own influence.

3. **The Lesser Key of Solomon and Asmodeus**:

The Lesser Key of Solomon, known as the Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis, is a foundational grimoire (a textbook of magic) within the Western esoteric and occult tradition. It features a catalog of demons and their attributes, divided into five books. In this text, Asmodeus appears as the 32nd demon and is sometimes referred to as Asmoday or Asmodai.

As a powerful demon featured in the Lemegeton, Asmodeus takes on the role of a teacher and taskmaster for the magician who seeks to summon and command him. He is said to teach the arts of arithmetic, astronomy, geomancy (divination by interpreting marks made on the ground or patterns formed by tossing soil, rocks, or sand), and handicraft, while also capable of making those who command him invisible and granting the ability to find hidden treasure.

4. **The Book of Tobit and Asmodeus**:

The apocryphal Book of Tobit is part of the biblical Apocrypha, a collection of Jewish texts that did not become canonized within the Hebrew Bible. In this narrative, Asmodeus plays a central role as the antagonistâ€”harassing and causing strife within the family of the protagonist, Tobit.

Asmodeus, in the guise of a serpent, kills seven husbands of Sarah, Tobit's daughter-in-law, consecutively on their wedding nights. In an act of divine intervention, the archangel Raphael teaches Tobit's son, Tobias, how to create a smoke from burning fish liver and heart, which when burned, drives away Asmodeus. It is a story that is meant to showcase the power of faith and God's ability to ward off evil through divine agents.

5. **Broader implications on understanding demonic personages within the context of both the Judeo-Christian tradition and Western occultism**:

Examining Asmodeus in the context of Judeo-Christian tradition and Western occultism reveals a complex interplay between spiritual, demonic, and human forces. By tracing the development and intersections of Asmodeus' mythology from its origins in ancient Persia to its varied appearances in demonology and biblical literature, we recognize a broader theme regarding the nature of evil, temptation, and the human condition, wherein demonic forces personify humanity's vulnerabilities and flaws. 

Additionally, Asmodeus' presence in texts such as the Lesser Key of Solomon demonstrates the adaptability of demonic personages within the Western esoteric tradition as they serve to embody different roles, from tempters to teachers, depending on the context and purpose of the magical practitioner.

In summary, Asmodeus, as a powerful demonic figure, embodies and controls different aspects of human vices, specifically lust. His presence and roles in texts such as the Book of Tobit, the Lesser Key of Solomon, and his link to the Deadly Sin of Lust reveal his significance in both the Judeo-Christian tradition and Western occultism. Furthermore, understanding Asmodeus and his multifaceted connections helps us explore the broader implications of demonic personages and their roles in reflecting human frailty and the eternal struggle between good and evil within these traditions.
