  Compose a ritualistic chant to expel the ancient demon Asmodeus from an afflicted individual or cursed location, incorporating Aramaic incantations and intricate rhythmic patterns to effectively sever the malevolent connection and establish a protective barrier to prevent future possessions. Refer to authentic grimoires and demonological texts as guidance for constructing the verse, and consider incorporating invocations of benevolent entities for enhanced potency.

In order to accomplish the expulsion of Asmodeus, the ancient demon, from an afflicted individual or cursed location, we must construct a powerful, rhythmic chant that combines the essence of Aramaic incantations with the intricate patterns of sacred verses. The following chant, with influences from authentic grimoires and demonological texts, incorporates invocations of benevolent entities to empower its effect.

Begin by clearing the space and create a circle of protection with salt or blessed objects.

Ašqado rabba nagaro thraysa,
Qadisha Rabba meetsu shekhol Asmodeus,
B'shem Abba, Brā, w'Rūhhā Qadisha.

(Call upon the Great Watcher of the Threshold,
Most Holy Guardian, come before Asmodeus,
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.)

Aqrayad Semalya w'Hashmalya,
Qadmeleh bel-ḥaqīqa Uwraza b'Malkutha,
L'tukhol bel aweyet laykatlin d'Shārīrēy Asmodeus,

(Invoke the luminous beings of Semalya and Hashmalya,
Stand with heavenly light surrounding the kingdom,
To break the dark bonds of Asmodeus's malevolence,)

Ašmoday, ašqer b'shem Galgalil,
Tlat meṯrē w'Shīb'a Nura,
Abrakhat l'Sablistan w'misradan b'tislam al minayan.

(Asmodeus, I command you in the name of Galgalil,
By the power of three and the sevenfold light,
I banish you from this realm, and bind you in eternal chains.)

B'Shemayā w'Ara gevaran ālapa dashrē,
Qadishin w'Deyni'oyin zalgu bikrolla,
L'tḥam āydan b'ezro'an mēla d'ahlam.

(By heaven and earth, the ancient covenant is sealed,
With saints and angels now gathered upon the call,
By their aid, let the divine presence of dreams unfold.)

Rēsh galgalāyā w'kūrbak tāzayā
teţel tamaq w'lēv qaşqōlī b'Shalom
beţăţūr dārā w'bēt 'akhūzayyā min Asmodeus.

.As head of celestial spheres and purifying light,
Bring forth the balance and bind the wandering heart to peace,
Guard this sanctuary and make it secure from the grasp of Asmodeus.)

In the completion of this chant, perform final gestures or prayers to officially seal the ritual. Always remember to thank the entities you've invoked for their assistance in the expulsion. Maintain the protective barrier by regularly repeating the chant and reinforcing your intention.

**Note**: If the situation remains unresolved, consider seeking guidance from a specialized authority with expertise in Demonology and banishing rituals.
