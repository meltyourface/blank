In order to create a powerful and protective talisman or sigil imbued with the power of an angelic entity, I will first delve into the heavenly hierarchy and choose an angel with protective attributes. Among the archangels, Michael is traditionally known as the protector and defender of humanity against evil. Archangel Michael is a warrior who is often portrayed wielding a sword or a spear to represent his strength and courage in defending against darkness.

To begin designing the talisman, we must first study the symbols associated with Archangel Michael. The sword, shield, and scales are crucial elements that will be incorporated into the design. The sword represents his power to cut through negative energies, the shield symbolizes the protection he provides, and the scales signify his role in maintaining balance and truth.

To infuse the talisman with Archangel Michael's energies, we also need to consider the colors and numerology associated with him. Blue and gold are his most famous colors, symbolizing divine light and protection. The number 7 is linked to Archangel Michael because it represents divine perfection and completeness.

Now that we have gathered the relevant symbols, colors, and numerology, we can begin constructing the talisman or sigil.

Picture a circle as the base of the talisman, signifying wholeness and divine perfection. Within the circle, draw a triangle with a point directed upwards, symbolizing the connection between heaven and earth.

Now, add a shield at the center of the triangle to emphasize the protection provided by Archangel Michael. On the shield, place a pair of scales to represent balance and justice. Connecting the three corners of the triangle to the shield with diagonal lines will symbolize the powerful interplay of these elements in Michael's protection.

Now, it is time to include the sword, the primary symbol of Michael's power. Draw the sword vertically at the center of the triangle, spanning from the base of the circle to the top point of the triangle. The sword's blade should be radiant gold, while the handle is vibrant blue. To indicate his role as a divine protector, have the sword piercing through a serpent or dragon at the base of the circle, signifying vanquishing evil and darkness.

Finally, to strengthen the connection to Archangel Michael, inscribe the angelic name מיכאל (Michael) in Hebrew above the triangle within the circular border. Then, around the circumference of the circle, add seven gold stars representing Michael's association with the number 7.

The resulting talisman or sigil combines the powerful symbols, colors, and numerology associated with Archangel Michael, creating a protection tool designed to harness his divine protection and banish negativity. When used with belief and reverence, this talisman can offer guidance, strength, and defense against malevolent forces.
