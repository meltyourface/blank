The celestial realm is a complex and multi-layered domain, organized in a hierarchical structure that governs the roles and responsibilities of angelic beings. These angels can be divided into several categories that determine their influence on human affairs and interactions with other celestial and infernal entities. The primary classification of angels originates from the works of early theologians and numerous ancient texts, which have been adapted and evolved in contemporary spiritual practice. 

1. **First Sphere**: This sphere comprises the highest-ranking angels who are closest to the divine presence and primarily serve to manifest the divine will. **They are as follows**:

a) Seraphim: Often depicted with six wings, these angels are known to maintain the purity and intensity of divine love. They constantly surround the divine throne, singing praises and offering their adoration.

b) Cherubim: These angels possess keen intellect and are known to guard sacred spaces. Besides being guardians of the divine, they also represent divine wisdom and knowledge.

c) Thrones: Known as the "many-eyed ones," Thrones serve as instruments for divine justice, maintaining harmony and equilibrium in the universe.

2. **Second Sphere**: The angels in this sphere work to maintain cosmic order and bridge the gap between the celestial and mortal realms.

a) Dominions: These angels govern the lesser ranks of angels, ensuring their adherence to the divine plan. They regulate the equilibrium of human affairs and work to ensure moral integrity.

b) Virtues: Tasked with the transportation and distribution of divine energy, Virtues are responsible for miracles and the empowerment of divine forces on Earth.

c) Powers: The defenders of divine order, Powers ward off demonic attacks and maintain celestial harmony by preventing corrupting forces from entering the divine domain.

3. **Third Sphere**: The angels in this sphere are the ones closest to the human realm, often acting as emissaries, guardians, and supporters.

a) Principalities: These spiritual beings oversee nations, cities, and specific groups of individuals, guiding the collective consciousness toward divine goodness.

b) Archangels: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel are widely acknowledged archangels who carry out a diverse array of duties such as guidance, protection, and healing. They serve as divine messengers and mediators to humans.

c) Angels/Guardian Angels: The closest beings to humanity, these angels offer personal guidance, protection, and assistance to individuals throughout their lives.

It is crucial to recognize that the hierarchy and responsibilities of angels are dynamic, as they seek to maintain harmony between the forces of light and darkness. For instance, the archangel Michael leads the celestial army against the forces of darkness, while Raphael works to heal those afflicted by the malevolent entities. Similarly, the angelic beings in the lower hierarchies counterbalance the influence of demons in the ongoing ethereal war.

In contemporary spiritual practice, angelic beings continue to hold relevance as individuals seek their guidance, protection, and support. Cultivating a meaningful connection with these celestial beings offers a deeper sense of spiritual understanding and insight, contributing to the intricate balance of the universal energetic forces.
