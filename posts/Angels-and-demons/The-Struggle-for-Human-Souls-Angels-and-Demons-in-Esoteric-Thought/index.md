In the study of the esoteric and occult aspects of angels and demons, it is important to recognize the historical, cultural, and religious contexts that have shaped our understanding of these beings. While all of these descriptions may hold some truth depending on the lens through which they are viewed, the notion that angels and demons both influence human actions aligns most closely with the common teachings and beliefs within the esoteric and occult.

The idea of angels and demons as powerful spiritual beings capable of influencing human actions can be found in many religious and spiritual traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and various New Age and mystical belief systems. These beings are often depicted as serving either a benevolent, divine force (angels) or a malevolent, evil force (demons), engaging in an ongoing struggle for the soul of humanity.

The duality of good and evil, represented by angels and demons, has been a popular concept throughout history, as it allows for the exploration of human morality and the struggles faced when confronted with our own inner selves. The influence of angels and demons on human behavior can be seen as symbolic of our higher and lower natures, respectively, with our choices and actions reflecting which energy we choose to align ourselves with.

The study of angels and demons within the occult often delves into deeper, esoteric understandings of their true nature, rather than a simplified black-and-white concept of good versus evil. Within the esoteric tradition, the emphasis is on understanding the principles and natural laws governing the universe, including the spiritual forces behind angels and demons. In some cases, they may be both seen as aspects of the same force, albeit occupying different poles of that force, and are ultimately used to guide humans through spiritual growth, development, and self-awareness.

In conclusion, the view that angels and demons both influence human actions, promoting benevolence and malevolence respectively, and engaging in a constant battle for the soul of humanity, is the most accurate description in the context of the esoteric and occult studies. The symbolism of angels and demons in this context serves to remind us of the cosmic drama that unfolds within our own souls as we navigate the complex moral landscape of life and the human experience.
