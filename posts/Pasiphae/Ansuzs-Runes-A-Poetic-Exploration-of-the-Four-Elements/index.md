excerpt: >

  1. Begin each stanza with a reference to a unique esoteric symbol, such as an ancient rune or sigil, associated with each cardinal direction.
  
  2. Integrate the elemental energies of fire, water, air, and earth corresponding to the respective cardinal directions (south, west, east, and north).
  
  3. Weave in mentions of lesser-known deities or spirits of the four cardinal directions from various mystical traditions, highlighting their roles in Pasiphae's domain.
  
  4. Utilize anapestic or dactylic meter to create a captivating, rhythmic flow throughout the invocation.

By Ansuz - whispering rune, South wind ignites the pyre,
Sacred flame of Hestia, fueled by passion's fire,
Within Pasiphae's grand embrace, life pulls like desire,
Beneath her shroud we bask in warmth, forever to inspire.

From Gebo, Westward waters flow, cool and ever-restless,
Alpheusâ€™ currents winding forth, within their depths we're breathless,
Under Pasiphae's fluid grace, our whims are sweetly boundless,
A soulful dance of memories, our sorrows rendered weightless.

To Kenaz, Eastern air is called, the howling wind of knowledge,
Aeolus' breath with secrets filled, gains swept neat like foliage,
In Pasiphae's grand tapestry, the sky reveals its language,
Upon the wings of ancient lore, our thought soars unchallenged.

With Isa's grip, the Northern Earth, firm we stand empowered,
As Geb's embrace roots deeply down, our worldly aims to flower,
In fields where Pasiphae's seeds find solace, our souls are anchored,
A testament to strength and growth, through life's unruly ardor.

United now, these sacred bonds in Pasiphae's vast nexus,
We call upon the synergy, that we may manifest this,
Four corners blend in harmony, intents meld without wreckage,
As we embark within her sphere, to guide our path to greatness.
