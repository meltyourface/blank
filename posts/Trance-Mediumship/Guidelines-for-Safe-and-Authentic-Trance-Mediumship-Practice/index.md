1. **Reinforcing psychic defense and shielding mechanisms**:

a. **Preparation and mindfulness**: Begin each Trance Mediumship session with a moment of mindfulness. Visualize a protective barrier surrounding you, such as an impenetrable shield of white light. This barrier serves as your primary line of psychic defense, preventing negative or uninvited energies from disrupting your practice.

b. **Invoking spiritual protection**: Call upon benevolent spiritual guardians, such as spirit guides, angels, or other protective entities, to fortify your shielding mechanisms. Request their assistance in ensuring that only positive and helpful energies may enter your trance state, effectively warding off any negative or intrusive forces.

c. **Energy purification**: Before and during Trance Mediumship practice, use smudging materials like sage, palo santo, or incense to cleanse the aura and the environment. This helps to neutralize lingering lower-vibrational energies.

2. **Recognizing red flags and distinguishing between authentic spiritual guidance and potential deception**:

a. **Trusting intuition**: Pay close attention to your gut feelings, emotional reactions, and overall energy when receiving communications from the spiritual plane. Trust your intuition to assess if a message is genuinely helpful or if it feels misleading, manipulative, or fear-inducing.

b. **Familiarity with spirit guides**: Develop a strong relationship and a clear communication channel with your spirit guides. This will make it easier to discern when guidance is authentic and aligns with their typical tone, demeanor, or personality.

c. **Testing the spirits**: When in doubt, directly challenge the spirit and ask for confirmation of their identity or intentions. Request that they provide information only an authentic spirit would know to verify their credibility and presence.

3. **Implementing grounding and centering exercises**:

a. **Anchoring visualization**: Visualize your body connected to the earth by a strong cord of energy, firmly rooting you to the ground. This anchoring practice helps maintain focus and elevate control over the Trance Mediumship experience.

b. **Steady breathing**: Practice mindful breathing techniques throughout the session, maintaining a slow and steady rhythm. Deep, controlled breaths will help regulate energy and minimize distractions during the trance state.

c. **Affirmations**: Use positive affirmations to strengthen your connection to the spiritual plane and remind yourself of your ability to maintain control. Repeat phrases like "I am grounded and centered in my practice" and "I am fully in control of this Trance Mediumship experience."

4. **Establishing a post-trance cleansing ritual**:

a. **Energy clearing**: After completing the Trance Mediumship session, perform another round of energy purification using smudging materials to cleanse your aura and immediate surroundings. This will help banish any lingering unwanted energies.

b. **Salt baths or showers**: Physical bathing with the use of sea salt can help remove residual energetic debris from your body. As you wash, visualize any lingering unwelcome energies dissolving away, leaving your body refreshed and cleansed.

c. **Thanking spiritual protectors**: Express gratitude to the spiritual guardians that assisted in maintaining a safe and protected space during the session. By acknowledging their support, you reinforce your spiritual bonds and create a positive cycle of reciprocal energy.

d. **Grounding techniques**: Reconnect with your surroundings by engaging in grounding practices, such as walking outside barefoot, drinking water, or eating a small meal. This helps to recenter your energy, signal the end of the Trance Mediumship session, and facilitate a smooth return to normal consciousness.
