## The Chromatic Compendium of Infernal Dominions

**Introduction**: This grimoire serves as an intricate guide in cataloguing demonic entities according to their elemental infernal affiliations. It employs color-coding, esoteric symbols, and sigils to capture the hierarchical structures of these malevolent forces. Additionally, this comprehensive work includes methods for summoning and controlling demons, ensuring its functionality for the adept practitioner of Diabolism.

Color Scheme and Elemental Affiliations: 
1. Red - Fire
2. Blue - Water
3. Green - Earth
4. Yellow - Air
5. Lavender - Aether 

Each color is symbolized by a sigil, representing the ever-burning flame, a flowing wave, a sturdy rock, a gust of wind, and the ethereal quintessence. 

**Hierarchy**:
1. Infernal Overlords (Golden Crowns)
2. Grand Dukes and Duchesses (Silver Scepters)
3. The Demonic Legion (Bronze Swords)
4. Servant Imps (Copper Chains)

Sigils and Symbols: The left-side margin of the compendium features symbols highly associated with their respective infernal hierarchy tier; golden crowns for Infernal Overlords, silver scepters for Grand Dukes and Duchesses, bronze swords for the Demonic Legion, and copper chains for Servant Imps and its color-coded elemental affiliation.

Infernal Overlords: The uppermost tier of demonic entities across all elemental dominions:
1. Red - Azmodeus: Fire Demon Overlord, Ruler of Flames
2. Blue - Leviathan: Water Demon Overlord, Tsunami Tamer
3. Green - Beelzebul: Earth Demon Overlord, Regent of the Forests
4. Yellow - Pazuzu: Air Demon Overlord, Master of Storms
5. Lavender - Xaphan: Aether Demon Overlord, Prince of the Void

Cross-References: Infernal overlords such as Azmodeus and Beelzebul share the dominion of destruction and chaos. Text in the grimoire is color-coordinated and interwoven with lines connecting overlapping elemental dominions, highlighting intricate connections and relationships for easy navigation.

Summoning and Control: Each demonic entity is accompanied by details specific to summoning and controlling that demon. These summoning rites further intertwine with their respective elemental dominion, using items of symbolic significance.

1. Red - Fire Demons: Requires a blazing pentagram and charred remains of the summoner's birthplace.
2. Blue - Water Demons:  Conduct rites on a secluded shoreline engulfed by a lunar or solar eclipse.
3. Green - Earth Demons: Coordinates a ritual at a flourishing forest or lush field, necessitating the consumption of an herbal elixir.
4. Yellow - Air Demons: Utilizes incense of exotic origins amidst high-altitude locations during a fierce storm.
5. Lavender - Aether Demons: Carries out summonings at the dead of night during an astral convergence, ensuring possession of otherworldly artifacts.

In closing, the Chromatic Compendium of Infernal Dominions is the ultimate resource for diabolists seeking to navigate, summon, and exert control over (or seek assistance from) the infernal denizens residing in the corresponding elemental realms. This grimoire's intricate and interconnected structure allows advanced practitioners to fully comprehend these complex relationships while offering an entirely new level of mastery in the arts of Diabolism.
