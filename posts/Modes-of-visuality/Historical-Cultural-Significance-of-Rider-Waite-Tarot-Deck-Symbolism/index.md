1. Historical and Cultural Significance of Rider-Waite's Visual Imagery
The Rider-Waite Tarot Deck, designed by Arthur Edward Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, was first published in 1909. It became a staple deck for those interested in cartomancy and esoteric symbolism. Waite was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which influenced the deck's creation by incorporating esoteric philosophies such as Kabbalism and Astrology. The Golden Dawn sought to merge various mystical systems, including Egyptian, Greek, and Christian spiritual practices, which are evident in the cards' intricate imagery.

2. Recurring Motifs and Symbols in the Major and Minor Arcana
The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, with each card representing a deep archetypal figure or idea. The Fool (0) and The World (XXI) act as bookends to the human experience, with The Fool representing one's journey beginning and The World signifying the completion of the soul's journey. 

In the Minor Arcana, the suits of Cups, Swords, Pentacles, and Wands are associated with the elements of Water, Air, Earth, and Fire, respectively. Each suit is made up of cards Ace through Ten, along with the Court cards: Page, Knight, Queen, and King.

Throughout the deck, recurring motifs include specific animals, such as lions (Strength and The Sun), yods (The Tower, The High Priestess, and The Star), and salient objects like the Ankh (The Magician, The Empress, and Temperance). Additionally, potent colors like red, symbolizing passion and action, and blue, representing intuition and spiritual wisdom, can be found across the cards.

3. Connections Between Iconography, Color Schemes, and Composition
Each card's imagery, color schemes, and composition all contribute to its interpretation and divinatory meaning. For example, the iconic Lovers card features a man, a woman, and an angel above, representing the conscious, subconscious, and higher conscious minds. The sun behind the angel emits twelve radiant rays, symbolizing the twelve zodiac signs. These visual cues allow for a multi-layered interpretation of the card, which can imply relationships, choices, unity, or balance.

Another example is found in the Ten of Swords card. The composition showcases a person lying face down with ten swords piercing their back, suggesting betrayal and pain. However, the color scheme introduces a glimmer of hope, as the yellow sky and new horizons suggest a dawn after dark times.

4. Comparing the Rider-Waite, Thoth, and Marseille Tarot Decks
The Rider-Waite deck features detailed, narrative imagery, making it accessible for beginners. In comparison, the Thoth Tarot, designed by Aleister Crowley and Lady Frieda Harris, showcases abstract, vibrant imagery that encapsulates esoteric concepts and Qabalistic philosophy. The Marseille Tarot is an older deck with strong medieval imagery and more obscure, intricate symbolism.

Distinctive features of the Rider-Waite deck include its unique portrayal of the court cards, pips, and trumps. It also incorporates the Golden Dawn's esoteric philosophy, blending Astrology, Kabbalism, and other spiritual systems. The card descriptions generally portray a more positive or neutral light, promoting growth and evolution.

5. Applying Insights Gained From Analysis
Understanding the visual lexicon of the Rider-Waite Tarot Deck can significantly elevate the depth of tarot readings, fostering richer understanding and interpretation. This analysis also offers inspiration for creative works, such as incorporating the tarot's symbolism into literature, art, or design. Additionally, cultivating an in-depth knowledge of the deck's Modes of visuality allows for a stronger connection to the tarot that enriches one's spirituality and self-discovery, contributing to the broader occult community's understanding of the Rider-Waite Tarot Deck.
