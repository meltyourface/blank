In order to create a groundbreaking approach to integrating the mystic symbolism of Nordic runes within the Modes of visuality, we must first understand the core elements and principles of both the runes and the Modes of visuality. By doing so, we can then delve into the intricate interplay of visual elements by investigating the aesthetic, historical, and cultural significance of Nordic runes in the context of Modes of visuality.
**Step 1**: Research and Compilation
Compile an extensive repository of Nordic runes, their meanings, and their associated symbolism. Additionally, research the aesthetic, historical, and cultural significance of the Modes of visuality, focusing on elements such as line, shape, texture, and color. By doing so, we will be able to observe patterns and connections between the two domains, laying the groundwork for a highly innovative and mystical symbiosis.
**Step 2**: Synthesis of Esoteric Traditions
Integrate the Nordic runes within the Modes of visuality by drawing inspiration from established esoteric traditions, such as Kabbalah, Tarot, and Alchemy. By incorporating these rich, mystical systems - along with their respective symbolism - into the fusion of runes and Modes of visuality, we will be able to create novel concepts and visual representations. Some examples may include creating new symbols that incorporate aspects of multiple esoteric traditions or reinterpreting existing runes and symbols in the context of other traditions.
**Step 3**: Development of Multidimensional Applications
Develop a series of multidimensional applications that simultaneously enrich the complexity of this new synthesis and serve as vehicles for its practical implementation. **Potential applications may include the following**:

A. **Ritualistic practices**: Design ceremonies, rituals, or practices that use the new fused symbols as focal points for spiritual growth, personal transformation, and communing with the divine or otherworldly forces. These rituals can involve the creation and use of talismans, sigils, or consecrated tools featuring the innovative rune designs.

B. **Artistic manifestations**: Create visual art pieces, such as paintings, sculptures, or digital art, that showcase the blended symbolism in intricate, esoteric compositions. In doing so, the artworks can serve as catalysts for profound contemplation and moments of spiritual insights.

C. **Meditative exercises**: Develop guided meditations, visualization exercises, or other mindfulness practices centered around the groundbreaking fusion of Nordic runes and Modes of visuality. By utilizing these meditative exercises, practitioners may gain access to unique spiritual dimensions and develop a deeper connection with the esoteric principles and entities the symbols represent.

In conclusion, this multifaceted approach to integrating the mystic symbolism of Nordic runes within the Modes of visuality involves deep investigation of the visual and cultural elements of both domains, synthesizing inspiration from established esoteric traditions, and proposing multidimensional applications to fully embody the novel fusion. Through this process, we can create a groundbreaking system capable of transforming esoteric practices and principles, enriching the lives of those who engage with it.
