In order to address this knowledge challenge, we must delve deeper into the concepts of the three primary modes of visuality - microcosmic, macrocosmic, and noetic - as well as explore the historical occult traditions and esoteric symbolism. By analyzing the ways in which these ideas intersect and interact, we can gain insight into the overarching unified hidden principles that govern the cosmos.

The three primary modes of visuality are:

1. **Microcosmic**: This mode relates to the perception of minute details and the inner workings of things at the smallest scale. It takes into account the minutiae of symbols, representations, and manifestations, often exploring the connections between the individual components of a larger system.

2. **Macrocosmic**: In contrast to the microcosmic mode, this mode entails the perception of larger patterns, structures, and systems that govern the universe. In the context of the esoteric and occult, macrocosmic visuality considers the broader connections and relationships between symbols, energies, and forces that shape the cosmos.

3. **Noetic**: The noetic mode transcends the physical realm and delves into the spiritual, intellectual, or transcendent aspects of reality. This mode embraces the exploration of the inner meaning, higher wisdom, and spiritual significance of various symbols and teachings encountered in occult traditions.

In the context of historical occult traditions, esoteric symbolism often draws from all three modes of visuality. This can be seen in the Hermetic principle, "As above, so below," which emphasizes the interconnectedness of microcosmic and macrocosmic realities. This principle implies that what happens on a small scale (microcosm) reflects or influences occurrences on a larger scale (macrocosm), and vice versa. In this light, we can discern a multilayered relationship between the three modes of visuality.

Historical occult traditions like Alchemy, Kabbalah, and Tarot, to name a few, incorporate a complex tapestry of symbols and ideas that draw upon the microcosmic, macrocosmic, and noetic modes of visuality. For instance, Kabbalah employs the Tree of Life as a symbol representing multiple dimensions of reality: the individual self, larger symbolic structures, and the divine connection.

The Tarot, another well-known esoteric system, utilizes the microcosmic mode through the illustration of symbols and images on each card, while the macrocosmic mode is evident in the connections between the cards and their broader archetypal meanings. Meanwhile, the noetic aspect is expressed through the intuitive and spiritual meanings accessed through Tarot readings.

The interaction between the three modes of visuality establishes a framework for comprehending the multitude of hidden principles that govern the cosmos. By paying heed to the intricacies of symbols and their meanings (microcosmic), observing their connections within a broader system (macrocosmic), and uncovering the spiritual wisdom (noetic), one can develop a comprehensive understanding of the unified principles present in the esoteric teachings. 

In summary, the three primary modes of visuality - microcosmic, macrocosmic, and noetic - demonstrate a complex interplay within the context of esoteric symbolism found across various historical occult traditions. By recognizing and exploring their nuanced interactions, we can achieve a holistic understanding of the hidden principles that weave together the cosmic tapestry.
