The illustration in question is the "Splendor Solis," a beautiful example of a medieval alchemical manuscript created around 1532 by Salomon Trismosin. This richly colored illumination depicts various alchemical stages of the Magnum Opus, or the Great Work. The five esoteric symbols to be analyzed are the Hermetic Androgyne, the Green Lion, the Ouroboros, the Rebis, and the Caduceus. 

1. The Hermetic Androgyne: Often seen in alchemical illustrations, the Hermetic Androgyne represents the union of opposites to create a perfect being, showing balance and harmony. It symbolizes the combination of the masculine and the feminine, the active and the passive, the sun and the moon. Its origins can be traced to the ancient Egyptian god Hermes Trismegistus and the Emerald Tablet, which embodies significant aspects of Hermeticism. Representing the concept of "As above, so below", the Hermetic Androgyne is a reminder that the transformation within oneself parallels to the universal transformations occurring throughout Nature.

2. The Green Lion: Traditionally a symbol of the raw, untamed, and corrosive power of nature, the Green Lion is an emblem of the first stage of the alchemical process, known as "Nigredo" or "Blackening". The Green Lion is pictured devouring the sun, an allegory to the dissolution and purification process of alchemy. This symbol has a profound connection to the Kabbalah, particularly the Sphere of Tiferet (Beauty), which symbolizes balance, enlightenment, and the harmony between opposites. The Green Lion is a catalyst, signifying the necessary force needed to trigger the spiritual rebirth for which alchemy strives.

3. The Ouroboros: Often depicted as a snake or dragon swallowing its own tail, the Ouroboros represents the cyclical nature of the universe, the eternal return, and the continual re-creation of life. Deriving from ancient Egyptian iconography, this symbol made its way into Greek and Roman mythology and eventually found its place in alchemical texts. The cyclic process of creation and destruction demonstrated by the Ouroboros parallels to the transformation of the alchemist's soul and is closely linked to the cycles found in Hermeticism and Kabbalah teachings.

4. The Rebis: Depicted as a dual-natured being composed of a male and female figure conjoined, the Rebis represents the end goal of the alchemical process and the completion of the Great Work. With a clear connection to the Hermetic Androgyne, the Rebis illustrates the perfect union of the Sun and the Moon, the elements of fire and water, and the ultimate transcendence of duality. The Rebis is associated with the concept of Divine Conjunction found in Rosicrucianism, where the union of opposites results in spiritual illumination and enlightenment.

5. The Caduceus: Frequently seen in alchemical and esoteric illustrations, the Caduceus consists of two serpents ascending a winged staff. This symbol, associated with the ancient Greek messenger god Hermes, embodies the balance of opposites and the unification of dual forces. In alchemy, the Caduceus signifies the transformation of the base metal into gold, or the process of spiritual transmutation. The Caduceus is linked to various esoteric teachings such as Kabbalah, with the intertwining serpents representative of the paths of initiation on the Tree of Life.

Overall, the "Splendor Solis" illustration alludes to the complex, transformative journey undertaken in the Magnum Opus. It communicates the necessity of the apparent dissolution to achieve the union of opposites and spiritual growth. The evolution of the alchemist's soul, not the transmutation of metals, is at the core of this message that transcends time. The esoteric symbols found within this medieval masterpiece are a testament to the interconnected nature of Western esotericism, with roots in Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Rosicrucianism, resonating even in contemporary interpretations of the occult.
