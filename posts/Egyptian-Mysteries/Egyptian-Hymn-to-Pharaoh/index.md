  Compose an intricate Egyptian-style hymn commemorating the exceptional reign of a Pharaoh, incorporating well-researched titles and epithets that accurately reflect their accomplishments and divine attributes. Pay tribute to their prowess in both domestic matters and military conquests, detailing their wealth, contributions to the pantheon of Egyptian gods, and the construction of monumental structures. Endeavor to incorporate symbolic language, historical correlations with the divine, and nuances of Egyptian culture, to create an authentic and richly detailed ode.

Jubilant praise to thee, O Pharaoh supreme!
Guardian of Horus, exalted in grace and power,
Thy name echoes through the lands, a hymn divine,
Child of the immortal skies, born to mighty realms,
Great alchemy of Ma'at and Seth, justice and might.

Hail, thou Conqueror of Nubia, vanquisher of foes,
As the falcon soars, so dost thou reign with boundless virility,
He whose exploits strike fear into the hearts of traitorous rebels,
Beseeching the mercy of your golden, imperishable rule.

O Pharaoh, Enduring as the mountains,
Wondrous and wise, just as Thoth the ibis-headed sage,
Ruler of Upper and Lower Egypt, uniter of lands,
Builder of temples, erecting monuments to the heavens,
Bestowing wealth upon the children of the Nile,
Gilded tributes from distant realms to thy rightful throne.

Anubis, the keeper of the hidden chambers,
Whispers thy praises through the veil of the afterlife,
Whilst Osiris, Lord of the dead, awaits thy transcendent arrival,
Eternally ensnared in your radiant aura of immortality.

O Pharaoh, Savior of Heliopolis, atop thy solar barque,
Sailing through the day with the glory of Ra, sun god resplendent,
Blessed by the divine serpent Wadjet, protector and guide,
Embrace the path of your predestined ascension.

In thy effulgence, rays of wisdom sprout like papyrus oases,
An epiphany of engineering marvels adorning the earthly plane â€“
In your name, the world-shattering pyramids,
The sacred Sphinx, regal guardian of eternal enigmas.

O Pharaoh, Preserver of balance on supernal scales,
Banisher of chaos, restorer of verdant landscapes,
In the unfathomable depths of your eyes, a union of cobras dance,
Heralding the children of Geb and Nut, gods of earth and sky.

With arms outstretched like glittering wings of the sacred scarab,
Touch the stars that once whispered in your cradle,
Their secrets now shining, imbued in thy heart,
As thou art crowned, O Sovereign, the eternal and everlasting wonder.
