In the elaborate Phoenician pantheon that I have designed, the focus falls upon the city-states of Tyre and Sidon. The pantheon consists of a myriad of deities, each representing elemental forces, moral virtues, and celestial bodies, all with their unique attributes and spheres of influence.

1. El-Baal: The Supreme God of the Phoenician pantheon, El-Baal represents the sky, thunder, and storms. Considered the father of all gods and the creator of the universe, he dwells in a heavenly palace. His symbols include a bull, which signifies his strength, and lightning bolts that display his prowess over weather. Temples dedicated to El-Baal stand grandly in the heart of Tyre and Sidon, where inhabitants worship him and offer sacrifices during times of need.

2. Astarte: A fertility and love goddess, Astarte is also the embodiment of war and protector of the Phoenician people. Her symbols include lions, representing her courage, and a crescent moon signifying her power over the cycles of life. Ceremonies to appease Astarte take place during the planting and harvest seasons and before battles, where worshippers request her blessings.

3. Adon: The son of El-Baal and Astarte, Adon represents vegetation and the cycle of life and death. His symbols are the rose and the anemone, exemplifying rebirth and the transient nature of life. The Festival of Adonia, a week-long celebration, honors the death and resurrection of Adon from the underworld.

4. Yam: The god of chaos, representing the sea and its destructive nature, Yam is often depicted as a serpent. He represents the inherent struggle between order and chaos. A ceremonial ritual to appease Yam is performed during stormy weather, asking for safety in fishing and sea trade.

5. Anat: A warrior goddess and sister of Astarte, Anat embodies justice, protection, and healing. Her symbol is a shield with a flaming arrow, demonstrating her relentless pursuit of righteousness. Parades in her honor are held throughout the year, signifying the continuous quest for truth and justice.

6. Shakmesh: God of the sun, he controls time and brings forth order and stability. His symbol is a solar disc radiating beams, which signifies his omnipresence. Festivals celebrating Shakmesh occur during the equinoxes and solstices, highlighting his influence over the passage of time.

7. Aud: Goddess of the moon, she influences the tides and navigational abilities of sailors. Her symbol is a crescent moon with stars, signifying her connection to the night sky. Worshippers embarking on sea voyages pay homage to Aud, seeking her guidance and protection.

The intricate hierarchy within the Phoenician pantheon is as follows:

- El-Baal, as the Supreme God, reigns over all.
- Astarte and Adon are second, given their connection to El-Baal and significance in everyday life.
- Yam and Anat, representing chaos and order respectively, rank closely beneath, vital to maintaining equilibrium.
- Shakmesh and Aud, responsible for celestial bodies and providing guidance and stability, occupy the fourth tier.

The interaction amongst these deities is characterized by rivalry and alliance. Astarte and Anat, although sisters, engage in a competitive struggle for supremacy. El-Baal and Yam are eternal adversaries, signifying the perpetual conflict between order and chaos. Adon and Shakmesh forge a strong alliance, symbolizing the interconnectedness of life, death, and time.

This elaborate Phoenician pantheon intricately weaves together relationships, hierarchy, and the cultural values of the ancient Middle Eastern civilization's beliefs, providing a rich and profound understanding of their mythological stories and historical essence.
