This section provides an insight into the key aspects of occultism in the Ancient Middle East, highlighting major deities, rituals, and the significance of magic in their societies. As we delve into this ancient world, you will gain profound understanding and knowledge of Middle Eastern civilizations' esoteric and occult beliefs.

Key Aspects of Occult Practices in the Ancient Middle East

1. Mesopotamia: Mesopotamia, known as the "land between the rivers", was a fertile crescent located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. It was the birthplace of some of the earliest known occult practices in the region. The Mesopotamians primarily practiced polytheistic worship, wherein deities represented natural elements and held sacred powers.

2. Ancient Egypt: The ancient Egyptian civilization was renowned for its diverse occult practices rooted in magical and religious beliefs. Their magical practices encompassed a wide range of activities, from everyday rituals to grand ceremonial performances, striving to harness supernatural forces to influence earthly realms.

3. Ancient Persia: The Persian Empire, located in modern-day Iran, was a major center for esoteric and magical beliefs. The Persians adopted Zoroastrianism as their primary religion, which centered on the concept of Good versus Evil. They strongly believed in the power of sacred geometry, numerology, and other occult sciences to attain spiritual enlightenment.

Deities Associated with Occult Practices in the Ancient Middle East

1. Enki (Mesopotamia): Enki, the Sumerian god of water, was closely associated with magic, wisdom, and creation. He played a significant role in shaping humanity as a means to serve the gods. He was also attributed with the power over the mystical 'me,' divine decrees that govern the cosmos and civilization.

2. Isis (Ancient Egypt): Isis, the mother goddess and the symbol of divine feminine power in ancient Egypt, played a pivotal role in Egyptian magic. Worshiped as the goddess of medicine, protection, and fertility, she was often invoked in spells to provide healing, protection, and prosperity.

3. Ahura Mazda (Ancient Persia): Ahura Mazda represented the embodiment of wisdom, truth, and creation in the Zoroastrian faith. As the supreme deity, he was the source of all good things in the world and was also believed to provide protection against dark forces and evil spirits.

Rituals and Practices

1. Incantations and Spells: In Mesopotamia and Egypt, incantations and spells were integral parts of their magical practices. These were written on clay tablets, scrolls, and papyri, containing a wide range of magical formulas, prayers, and recitations. Spells and incantations were used to invoke, appease, or manipulate powerful deities and spirits in order to achieve desired outcomes.

2. Amulets and Talismans: Symbolic objects, such as amulets and talismans, were widely used to harness supernatural powers in the Ancient Middle East. These objects were inscribed with specific symbols, prayers, or images of deities to protect the wearer from evil forces, bestow luck, or provide physical healing.

3. Divination: Divination practices were an essential aspect of occultism in the ancient Middle East. Through various methods, such as astrology, dream interpretation, and cleromancy, practitioners sought to gain knowledge and wisdom about future events or the intentions of deities and spirits.

The Significance of Magic in Middle Eastern Societies

Magic was deeply ingrained in the societies of the Ancient Middle East. It served as an integral part of their daily lives and formed the basis of their religious, social, and political beliefs. Occult practices and the belief in magic were means to manipulate the natural world to their advantage. They sought the help of acquired esoteric knowledge to secure divine protection, gain good fortune, and cope with the uncertainties of the world around them.

Conclusion

The occult practices and beliefs in the Ancient Middle East permeated every aspect of their societies, laying the foundations of their religious, social, and political structures.
