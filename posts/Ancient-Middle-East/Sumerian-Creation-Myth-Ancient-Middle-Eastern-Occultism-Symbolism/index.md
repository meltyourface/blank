To tackle this knowledge challenge, it is essential to begin with an understanding of the Enuma Elish, the creation myth of the Sumerians, and then delve into its symbolism and potential influence on ancient Middle Eastern occultism.

The Enuma Elish is a Babylonian epic poem that narrates the cosmogony and the origin of the gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon. It is attributed to the city of Babylon, dating roughly to the second millennium BC. The Enuma Elish is not only a cosmogony but also a theogony, describing the rise of Marduk, the chief god of Babylon, to prominence and power.

The epic tells the story of the primordial gods Apsu and Tiamat, who personify the sweet and saltwater oceans, respectively. These gods give birth to a new generation of gods who eventually grow so loud and obnoxious that Apsu and Tiamat decide to destroy them. In a battle between generations, the god Ea kills Apsu and becomes the ruler. Tiamat takes on a monstrous form and seeks revenge by creating an army of monsters. The younger gods, afraid of Tiamat, seek a champion to defeat her. Marduk, accepting their offer, manages to slay Tiamat, and with her corpse creates the universe, dividing it into the heavens and the earth.

The Enuma Elish's symbolism features themes of separation, chaos, and order that are relevant to the cosmological framework of ancient Middle Eastern occultism, such as the following:

1. The Primordial Chaos: Tiamat, in her monstrous form, symbolizes the primordial chaos, making her the embodiment of the uncontrollable and terrifying forces of nature. This aspect is crucial in understanding the significance of rituals and symbols in the Mesopotamian occult practices, as they aimed to control and manipulate the powerful forces represented by Tiamat and her monsters.

2. The Cosmic Battle: The battle between Tiamat and Marduk can be regarded as a symbolic representation of the struggle between chaos and order, good and evil, dark and light. This dualism plays a significant role in ancient Middle Eastern occult practices, which often focused on the manipulation of opposing forces in order to achieve balance and harmony.

3. The Creation of the Cosmos: Marduk's actions, such as splitting Tiamat's carcass into the heavens and the earth, represent the creative processes and the ordering principles found in many esoteric systems. In this context, Marduk becomes the divine architect of the cosmos, and his acts serve as an allegorical template for creating and organizing an orderly system out of chaos. This idea directly influences the desired outcomes of esoteric rituals - bringing order to one's life, spiritual growth, and alignment with divine powers.

By examining the Enuma Elish and the symbolism within it, we can identify some potential influences on the development and practice of ancient Middle Eastern occultism:

1. Control and Mastery over Cosmic Forces: In their rituals and practices, occult practitioners sought to gain control over the same elemental and chaotic forces represented by Tiamat. By doing so, they hoped to create an inner balance and control over the external circumstances of their lives.

2. The Ascent of the Practitioner: Just as Marduk rose to prominence by overcoming chaotic forces, occultists sought to achieve spiritual ascension by mastering the cosmic principles of order and disorder. Through a series of initiations and magical rituals, they aimed to become more like their divine sponsors and reflect the divine attributes of Marduk, the triumphant god.

3. Talismanic and Magical Practices: The Enuma Elish also envelops a hidden layer of allegory for the esoteric practitioner. The story of Marduk's rise to power could have been used as a model for the development of talismanic objects, seals, and magical incantations, designed to harness the divine power of the gods for protection and spiritual guidance.

In conclusion, the symbolism found in the Sumerian Enuma Elish creation myth bears considerable relevance to the cosmological framework and desired outcomes of esoteric rituals within the ancient Middle Eastern occult practices. The myth establishes a cosmic blueprint for the dynamics of chaos and order - a foundational concept that resonated within occult practices seeking mastery over elemental forces, spiritual ascent, and the creation of potent magical tools. Ultimately, the Enuma Elish serves as a cornerstone for the understanding of ancient Mesopotamian cosmogony and its legacy within the esoteric traditions of the region.
