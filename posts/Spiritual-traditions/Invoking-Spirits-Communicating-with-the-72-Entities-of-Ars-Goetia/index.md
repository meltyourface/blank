To complete this task, we will focus on the traditional Goetic ceremonial magick system as found in the Lesser Key of Solomon, specifically the Ars Goetia section, which outlines the 72 spirits and their corresponding sigils.

1. **Choose a spirit**: For the purpose of this explanation, let's choose the 12th spirit, Sitri.

2. **Timing**: According to the instructions in the Ars Goetia, it is best to perform these rituals when the spirit's corresponding planetary sign is ruling in the heavens. In the case of Sitri, he is associated with the planet Venus, so a day and hour corresponding to Venus would be appropriate.

3. **Location**: Select a secluded location with minimal distractions, preferably a clean and quiet room or outdoor space.

4. **Preparing the ritual tools**: Gather the necessary materials, including:

  - The Seal of Solomon, a ring or medallion featuring a hexagram or another symbol of protection
  - A magic wand or sword to command the spirit
  - A chalice or bowl for libations
  - Incense specific to the chosen spirit (e.g., sandalwood for Sitri)
  - A parchment or cloth featuring the sigil of the spirit (the symbol associated with Sitri can be found in the Ars Goetia)

5. **Preparing the altar**: Set up an altar with the items mentioned above, placing the sigil on parchment or cloth in the center.

6. **Preparing the circle and triangle**: In accordance with the Ars Goetia, create a magic circle on the ground around the altar, drawing it with either a consecrated rope or paint. Within the circle, create a separate triangle of manifestation, which will be used to conjure the spirit.

7. **Ritual clothing**: Wear appropriate clothing for the ceremony, such as a white or black robe and the Seal of Solomon as a ring or necklace for protection.

8. **Begin the ritual**: Light the incense and enter the magic circle. Holding the wand or sword, recite a banishing ritual like the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to cleanse the area of unwanted energies.

9. **Invocation**: Hold the wand or sword, point it at the triangle and recite the following:

  "In the name of the powerful and the living God, and by the authority of the Spirits of Solomon, I call upon you, [spirit's name, in this case, it's "Sitri"]! I command you to appear within this triangle and answer my questions truthfully. Obey the authority of the Sacred Seal of Solomon and come forth from your dwelling, compelled to fulfill my will!"

10. **Communication**: Once the spirit has been invoked and is present, you can begin communicating with it, asking questions and seeking its assistance on matters in which it understands or has dominion over.

11. **Dismissal**: When you've completed your interaction with the spirit, raise your wand or sword and recite a command to send the spirit away, such as:

  "By the power of the Seal of Solomon and the authority granted to me, I release you, [spirit's name]. Return to your domain and fulfill the tasks we have discussed with haste. Annoy not our circles nor let thyself be seen until I call upon you again. Depart in peace, and let no harm befall me nor my companions. So it is."

12. **Close the ritual**: Perform another banishing ritual like the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, and then take down the circle. Cleanse and store all ritual tools until they're needed again.

By following these steps, and exercising due caution and respect, you can safely interact with and command a chosen spirit from the Ars Goetia, demonstrating your proficiency and mastery of this ancient and complex spiritual tradition.
