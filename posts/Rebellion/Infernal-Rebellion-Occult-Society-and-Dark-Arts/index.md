The Infernal Rebellion is a secretive, occult society committed to undermining long-standing power dynamics and amassing dark energies for their own ends. Through their arcane rituals, convoluted communication methods, and hidden hierarchies, the Infernal Rebellion has capable and loyal members dedicated to the cause. In this response, we will delve into the complexities of their practices, elaborate on their symbolism and rituals, and highlight the strategic interplay between their core beliefs and demonic arts.

Arcane Rituals:
1. **The Ceremony of the Black Flame**: This rite symbolizes the ignition of the inner dark flame that fuels each member's commitment to the cause. During the ceremony, participants create a circle around a black pyre and chant in ancient languages as they draw from the hidden energies that permeate the cosmos. The dark flame envelops them and binds them to the secrets of the society.

2. **The Incantation of Subversion**: This spell is employed to tamper with and control those in positions of power, thereby advancing the goals of the Infernal Rebellion. Cast under a waning moon, members invoke dark entities to strengthen the spell's potency. The incantation can implant seeds of doubt or rebellion in the minds of their targets, ensuring the society's growing influence.

Elaborate Communication Methods:
1. **The Cryptic Sigil System**: To communicate with each other covertly, the Infernal Rebellion employs a unique sigil system. Sigils are inscribed on various materials like parchment, wood, or stone using a cipher that only members of the society can decipher.

2. **Seance and Astral Pathways**: Masters of the Infernal Rebellion sometimes use astral projection and seances to convene in ethereal locations, allowing them to discuss secret plans and exchange information without leaving a physical trace.

Concealed Hierarchies:
1. **The Black Council**: At the apex of their hidden hierarchy lies the Black Council â€“ a shadowy parliament comprising the most influential members of the society. They plan and implement strategies for the society's growth and influence, orchestrating events from behind the scenes.

2. **Emissaries of Chaos**: Directly descending from the Black Council are the Emissaries of Chaos, who serve as intermediaries between the council and the Initiates. They are responsible for initiating new members into the organization, supervising the regional cells, and collecting intelligence.

The symbiotic relationship between the core tenets of the Infernal Rebellion and their occult practices emerges from their fundamental principles. These principles include defying established order, harnessing the power of opposition, and utilizing dark energies to propagate their influence. The arcane rituals, insidious communication methods, and the concealed hierarchy are built upon these tenets, marrying their ideology with the practice of dark arts. This union ensures that as the society grows and its efforts become more impactful, the potency of their occult practices simultaneously intensifies, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and power.

In conclusion, the Infernal Rebellion is an enigmatic and formidable organization with complex rituals, communication techniques, and hierarchies. Their core tenets and occult practices work synergistically to fuel their ascent into power, subverting established systems and drawing energy from the world's darkness. This intricate dance of ingenuity and darkness ensures that their insurrection is a force not to be underestimated.
