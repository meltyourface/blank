Answer: Attaining spiritual and intellectual enlightenment through the integration of all knowledge systems, symbols, and disciplines.

**Explanation**: The study of Arcanum arcanorum, or the ultimate secret, is an esoteric pursuit which spans multiple disciplines, belief systems, and ancient traditions. It is closely tied to the concepts of occult, mystical, and arcane knowledge. Striving toward attaining the ultimate secret is a journey toward spiritual and intellectual enlightenment, which can be achieved through the integration of various knowledge systems, symbols, and disciplines.

The other choices do not fully encapsulate the depth and complexity of Arcanum arcanorum:

- Uncovering the hidden alchemical formula to transform base metals into gold: Alchemy is a historical precursor to modern chemistry and one of the many disciplines involved in the study of Arcanum arcanorum. However, it is merely a small facet of this pursuit, and limiting the ultimate secret to a transmutation formula would be reductive.

- Summoning powerful supernatural beings to perform feats beyond human capability: Though the study of esoteric, mystical, and magical practices can involve working with supernatural beings, this choice focuses solely on an external power with a limited purpose. The true aim of Arcanum arcanorum is to transform the individual through spiritual and intellectual enlightenment, and not just command supernatural beings.

- Finding a direct path to communicate with the divine by achieving mastery over magical practices and rituals: While this choice captures a part of Arcanum arcanorum's purpose, it places too much emphasis on magical practices and rituals. The divine connection implies a goal of attaining enlightenment and knowledge, but the study of Arcanum arcanorum also encompasses philosophical, scientific, and metaphysical insights, in addition to religious or spiritual aspects.

The study of Arcanum arcanorum involves delving into a wide range of disciplines and belief systems, such as alchemy, astrology, Kabbalah, Gnosticism, mythology, and various religious and philosophical traditions. Scholars who endeavor to unlock the ultimate secret strive to find a cohesive system of thought, an underpinning principle that connects all forms of human knowledge. The goal is not only to uncover a direct path to the divine or harness arcane powers but to transform the individual at a profound level, enabling them to reach true spiritual and intellectual potential. This pursuit often involves the use of symbols, allegory, and metaphor as keys to unlock hidden wisdom and esoteric knowledge.
