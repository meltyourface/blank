The combination of alchemy, astrology, and Kabbalah to reveal the underlying spiritual connections between all things.

The context of the occult tradition and the study of Arcanum arcanorum involves an exploration of hidden mysteries and esoteric knowledge that spans across various disciplines, symbols, and principles. The answer I have chosen reflects a synthesis of these elements, as they work together in harmony to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the spiritual connections between all things.

Alchemy, a forerunner of modern chemistry, primarily focused on the transformation of matter, specifically the quest for the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life. However, alchemy also had a deep spiritual component. In the Hermetic tradition, the ultimate aim of alchemy was the transmutation of the human soul, symbolized by the transformation of base metals into gold.

Astrology, the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies, seeks to interpret their influence on human affairs and the natural world. Astrology stands as a fundamental aspect of the Western esoteric tradition, drawing correlations between celestial events and the unfolding of human destiny. The twelve astrological signs and their associated planets each have specific attributes and influences, which can provide insights into individual personalities and the course of their lives.

Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism, delves into the nature of the divine, the cosmos, and the human soul. Central to Kabbalah is the concept of the Tree of Life, which comprises ten interconnected spheres called sephiroth and the twenty-two pathways that connect them. The sephiroth represent various aspects of existence, while the paths symbolize the processes and energies that bring them into being. Kabbalah also incorporates elements of numerology (gematria) to interpret the meanings hidden within words and phrases.

The combination of these three disciplines offers a holistic approach that encompasses the material, celestial, and spiritual dimensions of existence. By integrating alchemy, astrology, and Kabbalah, practitioners can gain a more nuanced understanding of the interconnected nature of reality and tap into the hidden mysteries of the universe. These esoteric disciplines complement one another, creating a more comprehensive system that reveals the intricate relationships between the cosmos, humanity, and the divine.

The other options mentioned (Tarot cards, numerology and gematria, and personal psychic experiences) hold significance within the broader landscape of occult practice, but they do not offer the same level of synthesis and interconnectedness found when alchemy, astrology, and Kabbalah are combined. In contrast, this answer represents a blending of disciplines that work symbiotically to provide deeper insights into the spiritual nature of existence.
