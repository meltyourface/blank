Advanced Candle Magick Ritual for Enhancing Physical Presence and Aura

Materials needed:
- 1 large golden-yellow candle (representing the sun and confidence)
- 1 large purple candle (representing spiritual growth and power)
- Essential oils: frankincense (for protection and empowerment) and lavender (for spiritual growth and harmony)
- Paper and pen
- A lighter/matches
- Optional: crystals (e.g., clear quartz, amethyst, or citrine) to amplify intent
**Step 1**: Choose the optimal timing.
The most beneficial time to perform this ritual is during the waxing moon phase, as it signifies growth and expansion. Ideally, perform the ritual on a Sunday (ruled by the sun) or a Thursday (ruled by Jupiter, which promotes growth and success).
**Step 2**: Prepare your sacred space.
Find a quiet, clean space where you can perform the ritual undisturbed. Clear the energy by burning sage or palo santo. If desired, create a simple altar with a cloth, the two candles, essential oils, and any chosen crystals. You may also choose to include any personal items that hold meaning and/or represent personal strength.
**Step 3**: Create a unique sigil.
On a piece of paper, draw a sigil that represents personal growth, empowerment, and increased physical presence. This sigil can be anything you desire, as long as it holds meaning to you. Anoint the sigil with a drop of frankincense and lavender essential oils.
**Step 4**: Anoint the candles with essential oils.
Using the frankincense and lavender essential oils, anoint the golden-yellow and purple candles. Start at the top of the candle and move down to the middle, and then from the bottom to the middle. As you do so, focus on your intentions for personal growth and an enhanced physical presence.
**Step 5**: Light the candles and focus on your intention.
Light the golden-yellow candle first and say, "I call upon the power of the sun to enhance my physical presence, confidence, and strength." Then, light the purple candle and say, "I call upon the power of spiritual growth, allowing me to fully embrace my true potential."
**Step 6**: Visualizations and affirmations.
Sit comfortably in front of the candles, and gaze at the flames while focusing on your desired outcome. Visualize yourself radiating a bright, powerful aura that captivates and inspires others. During the visualization, repeat affirmations such as:
- "I am confident and powerful in my physical presence."
- "I effortlessly command attention and radiate positive energy."
- "My personal growth is continuous and limitless."
**Step 7**: Ground and close the ritual.
After spending 10-15 minutes on visualizations and affirmations, ground yourself by taking deep breaths and feeling any excess energy flowing back into the earth. Extinguish the candles, knowing that your intentions are set into motion. Thank the universe and any energies or spirits you worked with during the ritual.

Keep the sigil and the candles in a safe place, and use them daily for meditation or visualization until the candles burn down completely. Remember to nurture your intentions through consistent action and watch as your physical presence and aura continue to grow stronger over time.
