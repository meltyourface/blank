In order to better understand the symbolism and meaning of the union of Nuit and Hadit in Aleister Crowley's Thelemic cosmology, we shall first explore their individual characteristics and then delve into their union, its importance in sexual magick practices, and the transformative effect of the interplay of opposing forces.

Nuit (also known as Nut) is the ancient Egyptian goddess of the sky and the Infinite, often depicted as a woman arching her body over the earth and representing the universe and everything within it. She embodies limitless potential, unrestricted by boundaries and earthly constructs. 

On the other hand, Hadit represents the finite, the center of every individual point and the essence of each separate entity within Nuit's infinite expanse. In Thelemic cosmology, Hadit is considered a complement to Nuit, often portrayed as a winged solar disk.

The union of Nuit and Hadit is crucial within the context of Aleister Crowley's Thelemic cosmology. When these two forces converge, they create the potential for manifestation through the Divine Spark or the "Star," which signifies each individual's liberty to express their highest will or purpose.

The connection between the union of Nuit and Hadit and the central principles of Crowley's sexual magick practices becomes evident as we examine the conjoining of complementary energies. In sexual magick, practitioners often harness the dynamic interplay between these opposing forces - the feminine (Nuit, the Infinite) and the masculine (Hadit, the finite) - to initiate a transcendent and transformative experience.

When Crowley designed his sexual magick practices, he drew inspiration from several sources, including Eastern practices like yoga and tantra that were rooted in awakening dormant energies and maximizing one's spiritual potential. By combining opposing energies (i.e., masculine and feminine principles), he believed sexual union could channel the power to awaken the individual's latent capabilities, often called the "Kundalini" energy in Eastern practices.

The transformative aspect of the union between Nuit and Hadit correlates with the practitioner using their individual energy, combined with their partner's power, to achieve specific aims in their spiritual practice. This process often involves directing the energies produced during the sexual act towards a focused goal, which could vary from personal growth to the attainment of spiritual visions.

In summary, the conjoining of Nuit and Hadit in Crowley's Thelemic cosmology represents the union of the Infinite and the finite, the boundless and the individual. Their union is essential not only for the manifestation of the Divine Spark in each person but also as a core component of his sexual magick practices. Sexual magick aims to achieve personal and spiritual transformation by harnessing the interplay of opposing forces, often represented by the masculine and feminine energies of the practitioners who partake in the process.
