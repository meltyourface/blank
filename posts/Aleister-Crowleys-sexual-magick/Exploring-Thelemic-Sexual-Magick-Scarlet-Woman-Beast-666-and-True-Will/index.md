To unpack the connection between Aleister Crowley's famous quote "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" and the concept of True Will in the context of sexual magick, we must first understand some of the core philosophical tenets upon which his Thelemic system is built. This will help us clarify the role sexual magick plays in the transformative process and the individual's spiritual journey. We will then examine the symbolic roles of the Scarlet Woman, Beast 666, and the Great Work in relation to this journey.

Aleister Crowley's "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" is the central axiom of his spiritual philosophy, Thelema. It posits that each individual has a singular, unique purpose – their True Will. It is crucial to understand that "Do what thou wilt" is not an invitation to indulge in whims and fancies but rather to align oneself with the cosmic purpose that transcends ego, societal norms, and personal desires. This alignment generates a sense of profound harmony and ultimately leads to spiritual growth and self-actualization.

Now that we understand the importance of discovering and living one's True Will, let us delve into sexual magick's role in this process. Within the Thelemic framework, sexual energy is believed to be the most potent and versatile force in the universe. It is the fundamental creative force that can be harnessed and manipulated to bring about change, transformation, and enlightenment.

Sexual magick can be seen as a tool for spiritual alchemy intended to convert one's base desires, symbolically represented by the sexual act, into spiritual gold – the transformative energy used to fuel the search for one's True Will. By mastering and directing sexual energies through carefully crafted rituals and symbolic acts, the practitioner aims to tap into their deepest potential, break free from limiting constructs, and attain spiritual awakening.

In this spiritual alchemical process, the roles of the Scarlet Woman (Babalon) and the Beast 666 (the incarnation of the Antichrist in prophecy) represent the archetypal polarities of feminine and masculine energy. The interaction and dynamic interplay of these energies, as channeled and embodied through the two figures, are the keys to activate the transformative potential in the practitioner.

The Scarlet Woman, as the personification of divine feminine energy, represents the all-embracing, creative force of the universe. She is an agent of liberation and a catalyst for spiritual change. The Beast 666, on the other hand, is the archetype of the divine masculine and plays the role of challenging traditional spiritual dogma by embracing carnal desires. Together, these polar forces unite in the sexual magick practicing to seek, discover, and manifest one's True Will.

The Great Work, as the overarching concept in the spiritual journey, is the magnum opus or ultimate goal of the Thelemic practitioner. It is the process of integrating the different elements of one's being, embracing the full range of life experiences, and achieving spiritual enlightenment. Sexual magick serves as an essential vehicle during this process, as it provides the means to fully harness and transform the potent energy within, necessary to attain spiritual growth and realize the True Will.

In conclusion, Crowley's famous quote "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" emphasizes the importance of living one's True Will. Sexual magick, as a central practice in Thelema, is a powerful means of transmuting and directing energy to the discovery and realization of that Will. The roles of the Scarlet Woman, Beast 666, and the Great Work are all interconnected elements of this spiritual and evolutionary journey, each contributing to the practitioner's ultimate goal of self-actualization and enlightenment.
