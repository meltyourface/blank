Aleister Crowley was an influential and controversial figure in the world of esotericism and occultism from the late 19th to the mid-20th century. His work laid the foundation for various modern occult traditions, particularly those related to Thelema, a spiritual philosophy he founded. Two essential concepts in his teachings are the "True Will" and the practice of Sexual Magick. This answer will outline the connection between these ideas, focusing on symbolism, invocations, and the cultivation of the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA).

Essentially, the True Will is an individual's ultimate, divine purpose in life as dictated by one's Higher Self. It transcends mundane desires and instincts and embodies one's inherent spiritual nature. Crowley considered discovering and manifesting one's True Will to be the ultimate goal for human existence. In turn, accomplishing this purpose can bring personal fulfillment, harmony with the universe, and spiritual enlightenment.

Sexual Magick, within Crowley's system, is a practical and potent method for tapping into and utilizing the powerful forces of sexual energy in the pursuit of various magical and mystical aims. Chief among these goals is discovering and manifesting one's True Will. Sexual energy, within this framework, represents both the creative potential of the Divine and the union of the microcosm (the human) and macrocosm (the universe).

Within Crowley's work, symbolism plays a prominent role in connecting these concepts. The union of opposites, as represented by sexual union, can symbolize both the merging of the microcosm and macrocosm, but also the resolution of the duality within oneself. The sexual act, thus, becomes an expression of True Will, as it connects practitioners to their Higher Self by allowing them to access the divine creative force.

In his magickal practices, Crowley used various invocations and rituals to harness sexual energy and connect with the True Will. For instance, rituals like the Star Sapphire and the Gnostic Mass celebrate the Sacred Marriage, invoking divine energies and evoking the divine feminine (Babalon) and divine masculine (the Beast) principles. These invocations create a ritual context for sexual union, making it an essentially magickal act that can facilitate the manifestation of the True Will.

The cultivation of the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA) is closely linked to both the True Will and Sexual Magick. The HGA represents a practitioner's inherent divine natureâ€”their True Self. As such, the HGA is a crucial guide for discovering and manifesting an individual's True Will. Sexual Magick serves to develop and deepen the connection with one's HGA, allowing for increased awareness, guidance, and the eventual union with the Higher Self.

In summary, the connection between Aleister Crowley's concept of True Will and the practice of Sexual Magick lies in the shared pursuit of spiritual awakening and self-discovery. Symbolism serves as a bridge that links these ideas, primarily through the representation of sexual union as an expression of divine creativity and universal harmony. Invocations and rituals, such as those in the Star Sapphire and the Gnostic Mass, facilitate the union of divine principles, paving the way for the manifestation of True Will. Lastly, the cultivation of the Holy Guardian Angel enables practitioners to discover their True Will and provides a method by which they can reach spiritual enlightenment through the practice of Sexual Magick.
