To thoroughly address this knowledge challenge, it's crucial to first explore the underlying concepts and establish their context within Aleister Crowley's sexual magick and Thelemic thought. Therefore, in this response, we shall delve into the following key aspects:

1. Solve et Coagula in alchemical principles
2. Sexual magick in Aleister Crowley's philosophy
3. The Scarlet Woman and her relationship with Babalon 
4. The microcosm and macrocosm in Thelemic thought
5. Synthesizing these concepts to analyze their significance

1. **Solve et Coagula in alchemical principles**:

Alchemical practices and philosophy are ancient and have influenced various esoteric, spiritual, and religious traditions across the centuries. One of the core principles in alchemy is Solve et Coagula, which translates to "Dissolve and Coagulate" or "Separate and Join."

Solve signifies breaking down, dissolving, or separating components of a compound, whereas Coagula represents the process of bringing together, joining, or forming new combinations of elements. This two-stage principle symbolizes the cycles of creation, dissolution, and rebirth, often applied to personal transformation and spiritual development.

2. **Sexual magick in Aleister Crowley's philosophy**:

Sexual magick, as advocated by Aleister Crowley, combines sexual energy and practices with the intention of achieving altered states of consciousness, spiritual transformation, and manifesting one's willpower. This practice is rooted in the overarching Thelemic philosophy, which emphasizes discovering and aligning with one's True Will—consequently expressing the individual's divine nature.

Sexual magick harnesses kundalini energy, the fundamental life force, to empower rituals and meditative practices. It often involves the practitioner uniting their conscious intention with their sexual energy, using various ritualistic techniques, and directing it towards the desired goal.

3. **The Scarlet Woman and her relationship with Babalon**:

In Thelemic thought, the Scarlet Woman is considered the embodiment of Babalon, the Great Mother Goddess—a figure associated with fertility and sexual liberation. She is regarded as a powerful force resonating with divine feminine energy. Babalon's counterpoint is the male entity, Chaos, symbolizing the generative aspect of the divine.

The Scarlet Woman, when taking part in sexual magick rituals, acts as a sacred vessel for the force of Babalon, allowing the practitioner to invoke the divine feminine energy and channel it for manifestation. She also represents the liberated, sensual, and empowered aspects of womanhood, further strengthening the transformative potential of sexual magick.

4. **The microcosm and macrocosm in Thelemic thought**:

The concepts of microcosm and macrocosm are rooted in the ancient Hermetic philosophy, succinctly expressed by the axiom "As above, so below." In Thelemic thought, the microcosm represents the individual human being—their body, mind, spirit, and energies—while the macrocosm corresponds to the larger universe and its interconnected elements.

This principle emphasizes the interconnectedness of everything in the universe: the individual's thoughts, actions, and energies affect the greater reality. Therefore, sexual magick rituals involving the microcosm can have a significant impact on the macrocosm by tapping into powerful cosmic archetypes and energies.

5. **Synthesizing these concepts to analyze their significance**:

When we examine Solve et Coagula in connection with Aleister Crowley's sexual magick, we see that the transformative alchemical principle resonates with the potential of sexual energy to bring dissolution and reintegration. This can manifest as an ego-dissolving experience, helping the practitioner break down their existing mental and emotional structures, only to reintegrate them in a more evolved state.

The presence of the Scarlet Woman and her embodiment of Babalon serve as a conduit for divine feminine energy, facilitating the Solve et Coagula process on a cosmic level. Drawing upon this energy during the rituals enhances the potency of the transformation and emphasizes the union of opposites, as denoted by the interaction between Babalon and Chaos.

Lastly, taking into account the microcosm and macrocosm's interplay in Thelemic thought, we can infer that the cycles of dissolution and reintegration occur not only at the individual level but also affect the larger cosmic reality. This synchrony with Thelemic ideals reflects the Hermetic philosophy's influence and demonstrates how sexual magick operates within the framework of universal interconnectedness.

In conclusion, the alchemical principle of Solve et Coagula serves as a transformative process that aligns with the aims of Aleister Crowley's sexual magick practices. By embodying the Scarlet Woman and invoking the energies of Babalon, practitioners take part in a sacred dance of dissolution and reintegration, affecting both the microcosm and macrocosm. Ultimately, these elements converge to create a potent metaphysical system designed to unlock profound personal and cosmic transformation.
