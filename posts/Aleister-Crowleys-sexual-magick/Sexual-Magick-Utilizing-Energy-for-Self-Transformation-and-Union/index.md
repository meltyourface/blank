- Utilizing sexual energy to attain self-transformation, enlightenment, and union with one's true will.

In the context of Aleister Crowley's sexual magick, the concept of The Great Work is accurately described by the statement: "Utilizing sexual energy to attain self-transformation, enlightenment, and union with one's true will." Aleister Crowley was an influential occultist, mystic, and ceremonial magician who founded the religion of Thelema. Within this system, he developed a branch of magick that focuses on the power of sexuality, known as sex magick.

Sex magick, specifically, is a subset of magick that involves the use of sexual energy for spiritual purposes. It is not merely about physical pleasure or worldly success; instead, it focuses on tapping into the creative and transformative potential of sex to pursue spiritual enlightenment and personal growth.

Crowley's concept of The Great Work refers to the ultimate goal of spiritual evolution and the attainment of one's true will, or purpose in life. The Great Work is synonymous with the process of discovering and aligning with one's essential nature, known as the Holy Guardian Angel in Thelemic tradition. According to Crowley's teachings, one must overcome mental, emotional, and physical limitations to realize their true will and reach spiritual union with the divine.

In sex magick, sexual energy is seen as a potent force that can be harnessed and directed towards this higher purpose. Crowley's teachings encourage the practitioner to use sexual acts and rituals as a way of generating and channeling this energy, with the intent of achieving self-transformation, enlightenment, and ultimately, union with one's true will.

This practice stands in contrast to many other mystical or spiritual traditions that emphasize celibacy or promote a rejection of sexual pleasure. Instead, Crowley believed that by embracing and mastering one's sexual nature, the practitioner could access a profound source of spiritual power and growth.

Some of the related concepts and practices in sexual magick include the use of specific rituals, symbols, and invocations, as well as the practice of Tantra, which similarly advocates for the spiritual potential of sexual energy. By understanding and working with these components, the practitioner seeks to refine their consciousness and move towards the ultimate aim of The Great Work.

In summary, in the context of Aleister Crowley's sexual magick, The Great Work is the process of utilizing sexual energy to attain self-transformation, enlightenment, and union with one's true will, as a means to connect with the divine and achieve spiritual evolution.
