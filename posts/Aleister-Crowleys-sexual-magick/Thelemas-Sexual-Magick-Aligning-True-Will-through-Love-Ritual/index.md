In order to examine how the core principles of Aleister Crowley's Thelema interconnect with the utilization of sexual magick, it is essential to understand the foundational concepts of Thelema and its relation with esoteric and mystical traditions.

Thelema is a spiritual philosophy first articulated by the British occultist Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century. It revolves around the concept of the "True Will," which represents the absolute and uninfluenced desire or purpose of an individual. The phrase "Do what thou wilt" is the central tenet of Thelema, implying that one should pursue their True Will regardless of external circumstances, social norms, or moral judgments. This principle is often misconstrued as advocating hedonism or egoism, but it actually implies the belief that an individualâ€™s innate nature, or their True Will, can be realized through self-discipline and introspection.

The second core principle, "Love is the law, love under will," emphasizes the role of love and unity in the achievement of one's True Will. It denotes the idea that love is the driving force behind all willful actions and that by subordinating love to the True Will, an individual attains spiritual growth and harmony with the universe.

Eastern mysticism has had a substantial influence on Crowley and Thelema. Concepts from Tantra, Yoga, and the Qabalah are intertwined with western occult symbolism to create a rich and nuanced esoteric framework for Thelema. Sexual magick serves as a key practice within this tradition, incorporating elements from both eastern and western spiritual practices.

Sexual magick, also known as sex magick, is the utilization of sexual energy and experiences during ritual and magickal workings to achieve spiritual growth, transformation, and the manifestation of one's True Will. Incorporation of sexual practices into magick originated from Eastern mysticism, particularly Tantra, which views sexuality as a potent force capable of facilitating the union between the human and the divine.

In the context of Thelema, sexual magick practices often revolve around certain rituals such as the Mass of the Phoenix, Chakra Puja, and the central Thelemic rite known as Liber XV: The Gnostic Mass. These rituals are meant to harness and direct sexual energy towards specific goals or to invoke energies associated with deities, symbols, or concepts that align with the practitioner's True Will.

Both "Do what thou wilt" and "Love is the law, love under will" principles are deeply intertwined with sexual magick. By engaging in sexual magick practices, Thelemites work towards realizing their True Will, believing that the union of the masculine and feminine energies within the self and the ritual space helps them attune to their innate purpose and thus to their True Will. Moreover, love plays a crucial role in these practices, serving as the agent that harmonizes and balances the diverse energies, further enabling the practitioner to pursue their True Will with determination and passion.

In conclusion, the core principles of Thelema, "Do what thou wilt" and "Love is the law, love under will," are intricately connected with the practice of sexual magick. The utilization of sexual energy and rituals, informed by both Eastern mysticism and Western occult symbolism, serves as a means to attain spiritual growth, transformation, and the realization of the practitioner's True Will. Through the combination of love, will, and magick, Thelemites engage in powerful, transformative practices that aim to align them with their highest purpose and facilitate their journey towards spiritual and personal fulfillment.
