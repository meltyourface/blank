To respond to this knowledge challenge, we first need to understand the key concepts and components: the alchemical principles of Solve et Coagula, Aleister Crowley's sexual magick, the role of the Scarlet Woman embodying Babalon, and the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm in Thelemic thought. Following this, we will synthesize these elements and their significance in relation to each other.

Solve et Coagula refers to an essential alchemical process that seeks to dissolve and reform (or coagulate) substances to create something entirely new. 'Solve' stands for the dissolution or breaking down of elements, while 'Coagula' denotes the reassembly and reformation of these constituent components. In the alchemical world, this process represents the transformation of base metals into gold or the attainment of the Philosopher's Stone. Symbolically, this transformative process is applied to spiritual and psychological growth as well. 

Aleister Crowley's sexual magick, or "Sex Magick," is a practice where sexual energy is harnessed and used to achieve specific outcomes - commonly spiritual or psychic - through ritual acts, focusing intent and visualization. Within Crowley's Thelemic system, Sex Magick is employed as a means of spiritual and personal transformation and often works with polarities (masculine/feminine, positive/negative, microcosm/macrocosm).    

The Scarlet Woman, or Babalon, is a central figure in Thelema, representing the liberated and divine feminine principle who serves as a conduit between the microcosm and macrocosm. She is a symbol of strength, freedom, and sexuality, often associated with the image of the sacred prostitute, who embraces the full scope of her sexuality and divine potential. In Crowley's system, the Scarlet Woman plays a crucial role as an active participant and co-creator in the process of magickal and spiritual transformation. 

The microcosm and macrocosm principle refers to the correspondence and reflection between the individual or small scale (microcosm) and the universe or large scale (macrocosm). According to Hermetic philosophy, these two aspects are interconnected and their relationship is central to understanding the cosmos and humanity's role in it. Within Thelemic thought, the microcosm equates with the individual practitioner, while the macrocosm denotes the cosmic forces and energies associated with their spiritual path. 

Now, we will synthesize these concepts in relation to the alchemical principles of Solve et Coagula and Aleister Crowley's sexual magick. In this context, Solve et Coagula's transformative process can be seen as a parallel to the workings of sexual magick, where the sexual energy and physical act of union serve as the catalysts for dissolving the individual ego (solve) and reforming an elevated state of consciousness (coagula). As the practitioner engages in Ritual Sex Magick, the goal is to dissolve and transmute individual consciousness to align with the divine will, reflected through the interaction of microcosmic and macrocosmic forces. 

The role of the Scarlet Woman as the embodiment of Babalon contributes significantly to this transformative process. Within the rituals of sexual magick, the Scarlet Woman symbolizes the macrocosmic feminine force that reflects and complements the microcosmic masculine energy represented by the practitioner or a partner. The interplay between these two forces, along with their fusion, are essential for transformation. Through the figure of the Scarlet Woman, the microcosm and macrocosm converge, allowing the magickal practitioner to access and harness the powerful energies needed for their growth and spiritual evolution. 

In conclusion, the alchemical principles of Solve et Coagula play an essential role in Aleister Crowley's sexual magick, informing the transformative aspects of the practice. The significance of the Scarlet Woman as the embodiment of Babalon highlights the power of the feminine principle in facilitating the interaction between the microcosm and macrocosm during magickal workings. The relationships between these elements emphasize the importance of balance, transformation, and the intertwining of physical and spiritual realms for personal growth and the attainment of higher states of consciousness.
