The Connection between Sacred Sex in Aleister Crowley's Sexual Magick and the Achievement of One's True Will:

To grasp the depth of the interconnection between the practices of sacred sex in Aleister Crowley's sexual magick and the realization of one's True Will, it is essential to first understand the basic principles and terminology embedded within Crowley's philosophy. As a product of his exploration into diverse esoteric systems and his own spiritual experiences, Crowley formulated Thelema, a philosophy and religion that revolves around the Law of Thelema, succinctly encapsulated in the phrase "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

In Thelema, the True Will is regarded as the guiding force that operates in a person's life and signifies their true purpose in existence. Crowley's sexual magick further explores harnessing human sexuality as a potent vehicle for achieving one's True Will. The sacred sexual rituals of his system, informed by meditation and intention directed toward spiritual transcendence, represent a means to attain a state of gnosis - an experiential and direct knowledge of one's inner divinity - whereby the purified will of the practitioners aligns with the universal cosmic will.

The Role of the Scarlet Woman:

The Scarlet Woman, a prominent archetype in Crowley's philosophy, responds to several layers of symbolism and spiritual significance. In the most literal sense, the Scarlet Woman serves as the female counterpart to the male magician in the sacred sexual rite. Her presence complements and balances the male principle, providing the union of opposites crucial to the alchemical process of spiritual transformation. In a broader sense, the Scarlet Woman symbolizes the feminine divine energy, or the embodiment of the goddess Babalon - the cosmic counterpart to the Beast, which represents the individual ego. As such, she serves as a symbol of unrestricted sexual desire and freedom, mirroring the defiant expression of Thelema's mandate to do one's True Will.

Applying the Formula of "Love is the law, love under will" in a Spiritual Context:

The principle of "Love is the law, love under will" is essential to understanding the spiritual underpinnings of Crowley's sexual magick. In this context, love denotes the unifying force that links all things, representing the divine energy that fuels the cosmic Will. This concept should not be confused with conventional romantic love, as it encompasses a much broader spiritual and cosmic significance.

When engaging in the sacred sexual act, the practitioners align their will with this all-encompassing divine energy and experientially comprehend their True Will. In this way, love functions as the transformative catalyst under the guidance of the individual's will during the ritual, facilitating their progress along the spiritual path. Through the conscious application of their will, the practitioners devote love to the achievement of their ultimate purpose.

To summarize, in Aleister Crowley's sexual magick, the sacred sexual acts serve as a powerful means of connecting with one's inner divinity and aligning with their True Will. The Scarlet Woman signifies a crucial component in the mystical endeavor, symbolizing the divine feminine principle that complements the individual's will and propels them toward spiritual transcendence. The formula of "Love is the law, love under will" encapsulates the spiritual principle guiding these practices, emphasizing the integral role of love as the divine, unifying force employed in the pursuit of one's True Will.
