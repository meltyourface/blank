Sequence of Powerful Mantras:

1. **Aum Ha Sha Geburah Agape**
2. **Aiwass Vam Cheth Teth**
3. Ra-Hoor-Khuit Nun Yod
4. **Amenta Ararita Enoch**
5. **Tiphereth Tetragrammaton Babalon**

Explanation of Mantras:

1. Aum Ha Sha Geburah Agape - Aum, the sacred sound of the universe, opens up the practitioner to divine energies. Ha and Sha represent the masculine and feminine elements respectively. Geburah symbolizes the sephira of power, severity, and divine judgment. Agape is divine love in Thelema, corresponding to the Will.

2. Aiwass Vam Cheth Teth - Aiwass is the angel who delivered Liber AL to Crowley. Vam represents the feminine energy, balancing Cheth, which represents the Chariot tarot card and the power of will. Teth is the serpent, symbolizing transformation, kundalini energy, and the connection between heaven and earth.

3. Ra-Hoor-Khuit Nun Yod - Ra-Hoor-Khuit is the Egyptian god of war and the solar energy, also representing the individual's True Will. Nun is the Hebrew letter for "scorpion," highlighting hidden strength and transformation. Yod, the creative spark, signifies the phallus and masculine energy.

4. Amenta Ararita Enoch - Amenta, the Egyptian underworld, represents the unconscious mind's power. Ararita is a qabalistic acronym for "One is His Beginning," highlighting unity. Enoch references the Enochian magick system.

5. Tiphereth Tetragrammaton Babalon - Tiphereth, the sephira of beauty and balance, aligns with the heart chakra. Tetragrammaton, the four-letter name of God, unites the divine masculine and feminine principles. Babalon embodies the liberated feminine energy and sexual power, representing the Scarlet Woman.

Guidelines for Using Mantras:

1. **Preparatory Rituals**: Begin by banishing negativity with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Perform a Ritual Bath to cleanse and purify yourself.

2. **Mantra Chanting**: Begin by entering a meditative state with deep, slow breaths, visualizing your intention. **Chant each mantra for a specific phase of the sexual magick ritual**:

   - During foreplay and building sexual energy: Aum Ha Sha Geburah Agape
   - At the height of sexual arousal, right before orgasm: Aiwass Vam Cheth Teth
   - During orgasm and peak spiritual ecstasy: Ra-Hoor-Khuit Nun Yod
   - As the energy begins to settle: Amenta Ararita Enoch
   - During afterglow and conclusion of the ritual: Tiphereth Tetragrammaton Babalon

3. **Visualization and Breathing Techniques**: As you chant each mantra, visualize the associated concepts and symbols, aligning them with your intention. Employ controlled, rhythmic breaths to help maintain focus.

Complementary Practices:

1. **Sigil Activation**: Create a sigil symbolizing your intention. Before beginning the sex magick ritual, charge the sigil by gazing intensely at it while building excitement. During the ritual, visualize and concentrate on the sigil.

2. **Tantric Methodologies**: Employ techniques like synchronized breaths, eye gazing, and mutual caressing to harmonize and amplify energies between partners. Visualize the weaving and spiraling of energies between chakras.

By following the guidelines detailed above, these mantras, combined with preparatory rituals, visualization, and complementary practices, are designed to create a potent sex magick working to effectively manifest the specified intention or desire.
