To forge an intricate Roggenwolf system for interpreting nocturnal visions, we first need to establish a foundation in the esoteric symbolism and occult knowledge that underpins this realm. By delving into archaic texts, arcane lore, and accessing hidden wisdom, we will piece together the elements required for a comprehensive dream interpretation system rooted in the mysteries of Roggenwolf.

1. **Assembling a Symbolic Library**: The first step is to delve into ancient scriptures, mystical treatises, and esoteric teachings from various cultures, gathering symbols and archetypal images associated with the nocturnal realm. Some examples might include the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, the Chaldean Oracles, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Collect and cross-reference these symbols to build a comprehensive and organized library.

2. **Developing Archetypal Associations**: Next, we explore the relationships between symbols and archetypes, focusing on their manifestations in dreams. We study classical works by Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell, examining the psychological and mythological aspects of these archetypes, and their roles in the collective unconscious.

3. **Correlating Symbols with Dream Elements**: With an extensive symbol library and a deep understanding of archetypes, we can now begin to correlate specific symbols with elements encountered in nocturnal visions. This process requires diligent study and the development of intuition, which can be honed through meditation, ritual, and other esoteric practices.

4. **Creating a Progressive Dream Interpretation Method**: The Roggenwolf system must be both expansive and adaptable, reflecting the complexity of the human psyche and the multifaceted nature of nocturnal visions. We devise a multilayered approach that incorporates proverbial, numerological, mythopoetic, and psychological dimensions, while also allowing for individual subjective variance.

5. **Crafting a Comprehensive Compendium**: As the final stage in this process, we compile our findings into a definitive encyclopedia of dream interpretation. This compendium, designed as a practical resource for seekers of esoteric wisdom and practitioners of the Roggenwolf path, features an exhaustive collection of archetypes, symbols, allegories, and transcendent concepts that allow for deep insight into nocturnal realms.

Through this meticulous process, we have forged an intricate Roggenwolf system for dream interpretation, reflecting the rich and enigmatic traditions of esoteric symbolism. This system embodies a culmination of knowledge and allows for a comprehensive analysis of oneiric experiences, offering guidance and illumination to seekers exploring the domains of Roggenwolf.
