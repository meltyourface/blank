In preparation for this in-depth mediumship session, I create a sacred space in which to work. Ensuring a comfortable and serene environment, I light candles, burn incense, and play soft instrumental music to raise the vibrations and enhance my focus on channeling Death energy.

As I sit within the sacred space, I begin to meditate, connecting with my inner self and inviting the connection with the deceased individual. After several minutes of concentrated meditation, the image of the individual begins to materialize in my mind's eye.

The deceased appears as a middle-aged man, standing at around 5'10" with dark brown hair and deep green eyes. He has an air of wisdom and kindness in his expression, a sense of contentment in his smile. His attire appears to be from the early 20th century, with a simple white shirt, black trousers, suspenders, and scuffed brown leather shoes. His name comes through as Thomas, and he tells me that he was an electrician by profession in life.

I ask Thomas about any specific messages he has for the living and he responds, "Tell my family I love them, and I am always with them. I am proud of what they have become, and my granddaughter reminds me of the way my daughter used to be. Her love for nature brings me happiness." Thomas wants his family to know that he is at peace.

Inquiring about his current spiritual state, Thomas shares, "I am still learning and growing, as are all souls in the afterlife. There is always more to understand and experience". It is evident that even in death, Thomas continues his path of personal development.

When discussing any unfinished business, Thomas reflects upon his relationship with his sibling, remorseful about an argument that was left unresolved. He wishes to convey his love and forgiveness towards his sibling and encourages them to find happiness in life.

Regarding insights on the afterlife, Thomas expresses that there are many paths and experiences that souls navigate in the afterlife, and there is no "one size fits all" definition of what the experience entails.

As the session progresses, I employ advanced techniques, pushing the boundaries of my connection with Thomas. This further exploration into his posthumous existence reveals a fascinating phenomenon: Thomas has become a spiritual guide for a recently deceased young man, mentoring him on his journey in the afterlife.

I meticulously document all information and experiences shared throughout the session, taking special care to note and describe the sensations and visions encountered during our profound exploration of the complexities of Death energy.

Concluding the session, I give thanks to Thomas for his willingness and openness to share his experiences and messages. I return to a state of centeredness and fully grounded in the present moment.

The compiled findings are organized into a comprehensive document, detailing each aspect of the session, the description of Thomas and his life, as well as the messages, evidence, and descriptions of the Death energy experienced during the entire process. This document serves as a testament to the mastery of esoteric and occult practices, and the deep understanding of Death energy.
