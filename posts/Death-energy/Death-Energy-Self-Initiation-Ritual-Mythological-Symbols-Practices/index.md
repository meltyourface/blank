1. Historical and Cultural Perspectives:

After conducting thorough research on Death energy, I have chosen to incorporate symbols and deities from various cultures and philosophies, such as:

- Egyptian: Anubis, the god of the afterlife, mummification, and judgement
- Greek: Hades, the god of the underworld, and his three-headed dog Cerberus
- Norse: Hel, the goddess of the underworld, and the Valkyries, who guide the chosen dead to Valhalla
- Hindu: Kali, the goddess of destruction and liberation
- Tarot: The Death card, representing transformation, change, and the end of cycles

These entities and symbols will be woven into the fabric of my ritual, adding depth and richness to its impact.

2. Crafting the Altar:

My altar will be adorned with symbolic objects that represent the essence of Death energy. This includes:

- The Death tarot card: Representing transformation, endings, and new beginnings
- Obsidian: A grounding stone that promotes protection, truth, and clarity
- Dried flowers: Symbolizing the fleeting beauty of life and the inevitability of decay
- A black or silver chalice: To represent the element of water and as a vessel to contain any ritual offerings
- Candles: Black for protection and banishing negativity, white for purity and guidance, and red for passion and vitality

3. Original Incantation:

As I stand before this sacred altar,
My spirit open to the energy of Death,
I embrace the lessons of decay and rebirth,
And invite the transformative power of the grave.

With Anubis at my side, I traverse the realms,
Led by Hades through dark and hidden paths,
By Hel's hand, I drink of wisdom's mead,
And Kali dances through my veins, fierce and free.

Death, rise within me, infuse me with change,
Liberate me from fear, and guide my ascent,
As the Valkyries soar, my soul follows suit,
Ever-bound to the whispers of Death's eternal truth.

4. Ritual Components:

The ritual will involve chanting, dancing, and meditation. It will progress as follows:

- Begin by lighting the candles and diffusing a blend of frankincense, myrrh, and lavender essential oils
- Chant the names of the deities three times each: "Anubis, Hades, Hel, Kali, Valkyries"
- Perform a dance that embodies transformation and fearlessness, guided by intuitive movement and breath
- Turn off any distractions and sit before the altar, entering a deep and focused meditation on the concept of endings, transformation, and rebirth
- Visualize yourself surrounded by the deities and symbols chosen, absorbing their Death energy into your essence

5. Post-Initiation Plan:

To maintain and refine my expertise in the domain of Death energy, I will:

- Study texts on the history, mythology, and symbolism of Death energy from various cultures
- Engage in daily meditation and develop my own rituals to build a strong connection to the Death energy
- Research and practice the various techniques of divination, energy work, and magical practices related to Death energy
- Establish milestones to track my progress, such as mastering specific techniques or meaningful experiences
- Seek out like-minded individuals and communities to further enhance my knowledge and strengthen my practice in the domain of Death energy

Through this comprehensive self-initiation ceremony, I dedicate my spirit to the transformative power of Death energy and embrace its wisdom and guidance in my journey to self-mastery and inner growth.
