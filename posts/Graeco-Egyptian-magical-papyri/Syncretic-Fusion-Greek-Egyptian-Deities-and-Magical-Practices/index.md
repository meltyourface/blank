Answering this knowledge challenge requires a multi-layered examination of the historical context, syncretic relationships between Greek and Egyptian deities, the influence on magical practices in the papyri, and the long-term impact on esotericism.

Historical Context:
Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri are a collection of texts written between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE, primarily in Greek but with some Egyptian elements. These texts combine the religious and magical practices of the Hellenistic and Egyptian cultures, which came into close contact following the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE and the subsequent rule of Egypt by the Ptolemaic dynasty.

Syncretism between Greek and Egyptian deities:
The merging of Greek and Egyptian deities was a central aspect of Graeco-Egyptian syncretism. Greek deities were often equated with Egyptian counterparts based on common characteristics, duties, or appearances. For example, Zeus was identified with Amun, the Egyptian sky god and king of the gods, while Hermes was equated with Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge. These syncretic pairings were more than simple equivalences, as the merged gods became new entities that combined elements from both cultures, creating a fluid and evolving spiritual landscape.

Influence on magical practices in the papyri:
This fusion of pantheons had a powerful impact on the development of the magical practices recorded in the Graeco-Egyptian papyri. Due to the syncretic nature of the deities, magical practitioners could use elements from both religious traditions to craft their spells, invocations, and rituals. This blending allowed for a greater range of spiritual entities to be invoked and a richer toolbox of magical techniques to be employed, leading to a unique and potent magical system.

For instance, practitioners would call upon Greek and Egyptian gods in the same spell, using authorities from both pantheons to bolster its efficacy. Additionally, they incorporated elements from different spiritual practices, like Greek ecstatic mystery cults and Egyptian funerary rites, into the magical papyri, further enriching the hybrid system.

The fusion of the pantheons and spiritual practices resulted in a powerful array of magic and ritual, which manifested in many forms, such as amulets, curse tablets, love spells, and exorcisms. These magical practices bridged the gap between the realms of the divine and the mundane, aimed at improving the lives of the practitioners or their clients by manipulating unseen forces and powers.

Long-term impact on esotericism:
The transformative effect of syncretism in the magical papyri resonated throughout the Hellenistic world and beyond. The novel combinations of religious elements in the papyri laid the groundwork for the emergence of other esoteric movements, like Gnosticism and Hermeticism, which would thrive in the melting pot of spiritual ideas that characterized the Hellenistic era.

Moreover, the blending of Greek and Egyptian beliefs contributed to the broader evolution of esotericism, as ideas from these traditions influenced the formation of later magical and mystical systems in the Mediterranean world, as well as the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic spheres.

In summary, the syncretism between Greek and Egyptian deities in the Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri fostered a dynamic and rich fusion of spiritual practices that profoundly influenced the development of magic, both within the papyri and more broadly in esotericism. This syncretic fusion provided practitioners with diverse and potent tools for interacting with the divine, and it laid the foundation for an ongoing dialog between religious and magical traditions that would shape the course of Western esotericism in the centuries to come.
