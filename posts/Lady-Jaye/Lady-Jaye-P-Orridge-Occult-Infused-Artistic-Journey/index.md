Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge (born Jacqueline Mary Breyer) was an English musician and performance artist, known for her work as a founding member of the experimental music and performance art collective COUM Transmissions and her collaborations with her partner, Genesis P-Orridge. Lady Jaye's artistic creations and personal experiences frequently delved into the realm of magick and occult practices, with specific symbols, rituals, and philosophical beliefs playing vital roles in her work.

One of the predominant symbols associated with Lady Jaye and Genesis was that of the "Pandrogeny project," an ongoing exploration of the fusion of male and female energies through the use of body modification, role reversal, and altered states of consciousness. They aimed to deconstruct and challenge societal norms surrounding gender and identity, drawing inspiration from the duality concepts found within alchemy, Hermeticism, and the philosophies of William Burroughs and Brion Gysin.

Rituals played a crucial role in the couple's artistic process, as they often used ritualistic practices within their performances and sound art. Employing ceremonial magick, chaos magick, and self-designed rituals, they sought to break down barriers between the conscious and unconscious mind, allowing for greater access to creativity and personal transformation. These rituals often included sigil crafting, incantations, and the use of sacred spaces.

Lady Jaye's beliefs were anchored in both the Western esoteric tradition and Eastern mysticism, incorporating aspects of Thelema, Tantra, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Her fascination with the exploration of the "third mind"—a state which occurs through artistic collaboration that transcends individual limitations and ego—was central to her partnerships and projects.

Her visual, sonic, and performance art had recurring themes like the merging of opposites, the deconstruction of identity, and the transformative potential of pain. Whether through the use of collage and cut-up techniques in her visual art or the chaotic, experimental sounds of COUM Transmissions, her work embodied these principles, directly influenced by her esoteric beliefs and practices.

Lady Jaye's collaborations and interpersonal relationships were marked by a desire to push boundaries and challenge conventional wisdom. The most notable example of this is her partnership with Genesis, which eventually led to the couple undergoing multiple surgeries in order to resemble one another physically, thus embodying their concept of pandrogeny.

Key moments in Lady Jaye's occult-infused artistic journey include the founding of COUM Transmissions, her participation in the infamous Prostitution exhibition, the creation of their band Psychic TV, and the ongoing Pandrogeny project. Each of these milestones showcases the profound depth and evolution of her esoteric explorations, seamlessly weaving together art and spirituality.

In conclusion, Lady Jaye's artistic journey was deeply intertwined with her spiritual and magickal practices, resulting in a unique and groundbreaking body of work that pushed the boundaries of traditional artistic expression. Her use of symbols, rituals, and philosophical beliefs allowed her to delve into complex themes and concepts that changed not only the landscape of contemporary art but also challenged societal norms and inspired countless others to embrace their own spirituality and creativity.
