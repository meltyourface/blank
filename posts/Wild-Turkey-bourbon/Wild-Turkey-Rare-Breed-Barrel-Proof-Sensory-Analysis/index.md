1. **Appearance**: Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel Proof bourbon exhibits a deep, rich amber color, demonstrating its time spent aging in charred oak barrels. The clarity of the bourbon is exceptional, with no haze or cloudiness to be seen. In comparison to other bourbons in the Wild Turkey lineup, its viscosity appears thicker and more viscous, indicating a higher concentration of oils and sugars extracted from the oak during the aging process.

2. **Aroma**: The nose of the Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel Proof bourbon is complex and inviting. Dominant notes include vanilla, caramel, and a robust oakiness, characteristic of Wild Turkey's signature high-rye mash bill and extended aging process. Dark fruits such as cherries, raisins, and figs are present offering a pleasant contrast, while hints of baking spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg, bring a warm, earthy depth.

3. **Taste**: On the palate, Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel Proof bourbon delivers a symphony of flavors. Initial sips reveal a rich sweetness enveloped by caramel and maple syrup, which evolves to reveal dark fruit and pronounced rye spice. As the high alcohol content of the barrel proof expression shines through, flavors of dark chocolate, leather, and tobacco become more pronounced, adding to the bourbon's complexity. The lingering finish leaves a savory oak and spice aftertaste, leaving an indelible impression on the imbiber's palate.

4. **Mouthfeel**: The whiskey's mouthfeel is substantial, due to its higher proof and more concentrated flavors. One can discern a velvety oiliness and pronounced viscosity that differs from other Wild Turkey expressions, such as the lower-proof Wild Turkey 101 or the mellower Russell's Reserve. The astringency and heat from the high alcohol content dances on the tongue, enhancing the whiskey's bold character.

5. **Finish**: The finish of Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel Proof bourbon is long, warm, and intricate. As the prominent oak and spice notes fade, they are replaced by a lingering warmth, evoking memories of a cozy hearth on a cool autumn evening.

6. **Comparison**: Within the realm of barrel proof offerings, Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel Proof stands out with its combination of deep flavors, robust aromas, and unique mouthfeel. It holds its own against competitors such as Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and Stagg Jr., showcasing the distillery's commitment to crafting exceptional whiskey.
