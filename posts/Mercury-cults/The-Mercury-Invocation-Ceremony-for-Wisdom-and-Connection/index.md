  Title: Invocatio Mercurii - The Mercury Invocation Ceremony of the Order of the Mercurial Magi
  
  Preparation:
  
  1. Schedule the ritual during the planetary hour of Mercury and on the day of Mercury (Wednesday).
  
  2. Participants should wear robes adorned with Hermetic symbols, such as the caduceus, the hexagram, and the ouroboros.
  
  3. Assemble the following ritual tools and materials:
  a. A central altar with a copy of the Emerald Tablet.
  b. A caduceus – the traditional staff of Mercury.
  c. Incense and burner – preferably fumigation made of cinnamon, mace, and gum mastic.
  d. A chalice filled with wine or water to represent the element of water.
  e. The secret and unique sigil created from ancient Mercury talismans.
  f. A ceremonial dagger or sword.
  g. Yellow or golden colored candles.
  
  Ritual Steps:
  
  1. Cleanse and prepare the space by burning the incense.
  
  2. Light the candles and place them at the four cardinal points around the central altar while reciting the following invocation in Latin:
  
  "In nomine Mercurii, Elementorum Magister, ego [name] lumina ista in tuis virtutibus accendo."
  
  Translation: "In the name of Mercury, Master of the Elements, I, [name], kindle these lights in your virtues."
  
  3. Draw the secret and unique sigil in the air over the altar using the ceremonial dagger, while intoning the Enochian chant to summon the mercurial forces:
  
  "Amprodias oladi Chis Mercury, naamah tadarb chokmah."
  
  Translation: "Amprodias, come forth, Mercury, we name thee in wisdom."
  
  4. Hold the caduceus and recite the Hermetic principle of correspondence as a reminder of the purpose of this invocation:
  
  "Quod est inferius est sicut quod est superius, et quod est superius est sicut quod est inferius."
  
  Translation: "As above, so below. As below, so above."
  
  5. Meditate on the sacred symbols from the Emerald Tablet and their connection to Mercury, focusing especially on the blending of opposites, male-female, life-death, and knowledge-wisdom.
  
  6. Recite the following planetary invocation in Latin to manifest the desired attributes of Mercury:
  
  "O Mercurius, astrologorum, magorum et philosophorum custos, da nobis intellectum, eloquentiam, et facilitate verborum. Ad augendas vires istius artis, te oportet servire."
  
  Translation: "O Mercury, guardian of astrologers, magicians, and philosophers, grant us understanding, eloquence, and ease with words. To increase the powers of this art, we must serve you."
  
  7. Using the ceremonial dagger, trace the outline of a hexagram in the air before each participant while reciting their name, followed by:
  
  "Sic in aeternum tempora commutentur: numen Mercurii semper crebrescat."
  
  Translation: "Thus, as the ages change in eternity, may the divine power of Mercury ever grow."
  
  8. Drink from the chalice as an offering to Mercury, sharing it among the participants while speaking the following words:
  
  "In gratitudine, offero tibi, Mercurio, vim elementi aquae."
  
  Translation: "In gratitude, I offer you, Mercury, the power of the element of water."
  
  9. Thank the Mercurial forces for their presence and assistance:
  
  "Agimus gratias tibi, O Mercurii praesentia et auxilio. Discedite in pace."
  
  Translation: "We give thanks to you, O Mercury, for your presence and help. Depart in peace."
  
  10. Close the ritual by extinguishing the candles in a counter-clockwise direction, beginning from the Eastern quadrant and returning to the same point.
  
  Upon completion of this intricate Mercury invocation ceremony, the Order of the Mercurial Magi and its participants will have established an empowered connection with the forces of Mercury, brought forth through the combination of sacred symbols, traditional planetary correspondences, chants, and invocations. This ritual honors the knowledge and wisdom of the Mercurial forces of past and present traditions, ensuring its effective application in modern practice.
