In order to create this intricate and potent protective sigil tailored for a Mercury cult initiation ceremony, we'll need to weave together several key components of Mercurial and esoteric symbolism. The final sigil encompasses the Mercurial attributes of communication, knowledge, and fluidity, and provides spiritual protection to the initiate during the sacred rite of passage.

Base Symbol: The Caduceus
The Caduceus, which represents the staff of Hermes (Mercury), is a fitting central symbol for this sigil. Two serpents intertwine themselves around a winged staff, symbolizing duality, healing, and fluidity. The wings signify ascension, communication and connection with higher realms.

Enochian Characters:
Select Enochian characters that correspond to the objectives of the initiation ceremony (e.g., spiritual growth, wisdom, and guidance) will be placed around the Caduceus in a circular manner. These characters add the power of an angelic language to further strengthen the protective element of the sigil.

Theban Script:
Using the Theban script, also known as the Witch's Alphabet, spell out the cult's name or motto and incorporate this into the sigil, weaving it through the Caduceus and Enochian characters. The Theban script adds an extra layer of mysticism and secrecy to the protective sigil.

Planetary Correspondences:
Incorporate the astrological symbol for Mercury within the Caduceus. The symbol represents mind, intellect, and connectivity. Other planetary symbols that resonate with the cult's doctrine and Mercurial aspects can be added as well.

Occult Numerology:
Integrate the number 8 into the sigil's design, as it signifies infinity, fluidity, and knowledge in numerology. The number 8 can be represented by two intertwined circles or simply by incorporating eight key components into the sigil's structure.

**Colors**:
The sigil should incorporate colors associated with Mercury, such as silver, gray, or lavender, along with any colors that hold particular significance to the cult's unique doctrine and practices.

To complete the sigil, imbue it with intention and energy through visualization, meditation, and any rituals or practices specific to the Mercury cult. These rituals may involve invoking the god Hermes, sealing the sigil with sacred oils, or performing an initiation ceremony where the sigil is charged by the energies of the group. Once complete, the sigil serves as a powerful tool of protection, guidance, and growth for the initiate during their journey within the Mercury cult.
