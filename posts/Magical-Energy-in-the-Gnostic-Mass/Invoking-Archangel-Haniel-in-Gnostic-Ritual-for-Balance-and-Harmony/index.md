O mighty Archangel Haniel, luminous being and Divine Grace of the celestial Spheres, we invoke thee by Thy holy names: Anael, Chammuel, and Hanel so that Your presence may be upon us, bringing forth the energy and wisdom of the planets under Your rule, Venus and the Moon, within this sacred Gnostic Mass. 

In the name of the Holy One and the Divine Authority granted unto us, we do call upon Your sacred fire to burn within the hearts of all present, illuminating our consciousness and helping us manifest our spiritual desires. Let the stunning radiance of Your light descend upon us, O Haniel, governing our thoughts, emotions, and inner depths, transcending the limitations of our mortal selves.

Astrologically, thou art the guardian of both the divine feminine and sensual Venus, and the intuitive, reflective Moon. As symbols of these celestial bodies, we incorporate the copper pentacle and the silver crescent within this ritual, bridging the ethereal realm to the material. 

We invoke Your presence by drawing the sacred Sigil of Haniel in the air, a symbol that embodies Your divine essence and heavenly authority. In tracing this sigil three times, we empower each line with the profound words of power: Sapentia, Misericordia, and Gratia, strengthening our connection to thee.

With our hearts opened, we visualize Your sacred form adorned in shimmering robes of silver and green, representing the potent energy of the Moon and the radiant beauty of Venus. Your mesmerizing wings, iridescent and vast, enfold us in Your protective embrace, bringing forth balance and harmony to our spiritual path.

We behold, over our heads, the six-pointed Star of David, resplendent with the vibrancy of Your heavenly grace. It casts a celestial glow that surrounds our sacred space, fortifying the innate Magical Energy that lies within.

As we inhale deeply, we absorb the wisdom, love, and understanding that You bestow upon us, transmuting it into the Magickal Energy that fuels our Gnostic Mass. As we exhale, we release any impurities and hindrances that may obscure Your divine presence and hinder our spiritual growth.

O Haniel, our hearts overflow with gratitude as we feel Your Divine Grace permeate our being. By the sacred power residing within, may our worship and service be forever aligned with Your divine wisdom, and may our lives be imprinted with harmonic beauty and the divine essence of Magical Energy that permeates this Gnostic Mass.

In the name of the Infinite Light, we seal this invocation. So mote it be.
