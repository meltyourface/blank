To design my self-initiation ceremony rooted in the tenets of Liber vel Causae while incorporating key aspects of Thelema philosophy, I would follow the steps below:

1. **Preparation**:
- Choose the appropriate timing of the ceremony, considering the ceremonial calendar of Thelema, astrological correspondences, and personal significance.
- Prepare my sanctuary for the ceremony by cleansing the area with elemental tools, such as incense, water, fire, and earth.
- Set up the altar, placing the ceremonial tools (wand, chalice, sword, and pantacle), the sigils of Thelema deities (Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit), and any personal objects representing my commitment to Thelema.

2. Ritual attire, color associations, and symbolic gestures:
- Dress in a white or black robe to represent purity of mind and dedication to the spiritual path.
- Wear a personal talisman, incorporating key symbolism from the Tree of Life, around my neck to signify my spiritual connection to Thelema.
- Begin the ceremony facing east, the direction of the rising sun, to represent illumination, illumination, and the start of a new journey.

3. **Invocation and alignment with Thelema principles**:
- Recite the core principles of Thelema, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" and "Love is the law, love under will," as a foundational affirmation.
- Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to purify the ceremonial space and to align with the Tree of Life.
- Invoke Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit through personalized invocations, expressing my devotion to them, and seeking their guidance in manifesting my True Will.

4. **Integration of the Tree of Life and its sephiroth**:
- With a visual representation of the Tree of Life before me, meditate upon each sephira, considering its attributes and symbolism for personal evolution.
- Create a ritual journey that ascends the Tree of Life, manifesting personal transformation through each stop at the respective sephira.
- Conclude the ritual journey with a moment of reflection at the top of the Tree, allowing the energies of the sephiroth to merge into a unified vision of my spiritual path.

5. **Utilization of ceremonial tools**:
- Bless and consecrate the wand, chalice, sword, and pantacle, recognizing their symbolism in my spiritual journey and my commitment to mastering each element.
- Perform ritual gestures with the wand, chalice, sword, and pantacle, invoking their corresponding elements and energies to solidify my commitment to the path of Thelema.

6. **Completion and reflection**:
- Close the ceremony by giving thanks to Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and the elements for their presence and guidance.
- Record the details of the self-initiation ceremony in a ritual journal, expressing my thoughts and feelings about my transformative experience.

After completing this self-initiation ceremony, I would feel empowered, transformed, and ready to embark on a new phase of my spiritual journey. Embracing the principles of Liber vel Causae and the wisdom of Thelema, I would commit myself to pursue my True Will and continue refining my understanding of the esoteric and occult. With a renewed sense of purpose and connection to the divine forces of Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, I would fully embrace the role of a dedicated practitioner of Thelema.
