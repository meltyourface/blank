To fully grasp the esoteric implications of Liber vel Causae as it relates to the pursuit of human evolution and the roles of the individual, Hadit, and the all-encompassing Nuit in manifesting the True Will, it is imperative to examine its tenets within its historical, spiritual, and philosophical contexts. As a central text within Thelemic philosophy, Liber vel Causae, also known as Book 77, serves as a critical guide to understanding its core concepts, symbols, and the interplay of various metaphysical forces.

At the heart of Thelemic philosophy lies the unique principle of the True Will, or an individual's intrinsic purpose, which is essentially the guiding force behind one's personal evolution. **The notion of the True Will is encapsulated in the central axiom of Thelema**: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." Liber vel Causae emphasizes that it is through the realization and pursuit of one's True Will—or the ultimate, authentic representation of one's innermost desires—that one can contribute positively to the world while achieving spiritual fulfillment.

To fully comprehend the significance of the True Will, we must turn our attention to the dual aspects of existence as expressed by the Thelemic deities Hadit and Nuit. Hadit represents the dynamic, active cosmic principle, and is often equated with the individual self. In contrast, Nuit embodies the static, passive cosmic principle, and is typically depicted as the all-encompassing, infinite space within which existence unfolds.

The relationship between the individual, as an embodiment of Hadit, and the universe, symbolized by Nuit, is a core aspect of human evolution and manifestation of the True Will within Liber vel Causae. Through the myriad permutations of existence, the individual—much like a single point on a geometric plane—defines its unique position and path within the vast, boundless matrix of Nuit. In this sense, the pursuit of the True Will represents the individual's drive to integrate oneself fully within the universe and actively contribute to its ongoing expansion.

From a broader perspective, the formula of IAO sheds light on the cyclical nature of growth, change, and attainment within an individual's journey towards self-realization. As an acronym derived from the names of the ancient Greek gods (Isis, Apophis, and Osiris), IAO serves as an allegory for the process of spiritual evolution that echoes the life-death-rebirth cycle.

**The IAO formula can be briefly interpreted as follows**: 
- Isis (I) symbolizes birth, manifestation, and creation.
- Apophis (A) represents dissolution, destruction, and transformation.
- Osiris (O) stands for resurgence, reintegration, and transcendence.

Liber vel Causae connects the IAO formula to the broader concept of Aeons, or distinct epochs of spiritual development and progression. Each Aeon represents a specific stage in the unfolding of the universe and humanity's role within it, and is intimately connected to the evolutionary process captured by the IAO formula.

With respect to the first part of the book, "The Circle of Manifestation," it is crucial to consider the principles underpinning this introductory section. Here, the circle serves as a symbol for the infinite, boundless space of Nuit and the cyclical nature of the universe's unfolding. The Circle of Manifestation, then, encapsulates the essential process by which existence itself is generated, actualized, and perpetuated.

In conclusion, the esoteric implications of Liber vel Causae as they pertain to human evolution and the pursuit of the True Will encompass a rich and complex array of metaphysical ideas. From the interplay between the individual (Hadit) and the universe (Nuit), to the cyclical stages of progress exemplified by the formula of IAO, the text offers a profound exploration of the principles and forces driving humanity's growth and spiritual development. Furthermore, the Circle of Manifestation, as a foundational component of Liber vel Causae, serves as an apt metaphor for the eternal, interconnected dance of life, death, and rebirth that defines our collective journey towards ultimate Self-realization.
