1. The Servitor's Role and Objectives

In the Avalon Working sphere, the servitor's primary role and objectives are to act as a conduit and amplifier of the practitioner's intentions, enhancing the ability to manifest one's desires in the physical world. Specifically, the servitor, named Aethelred, will aid in increasing the practitioner's knowledge and understanding of the esoterica, unlocking latent psychic abilities, and enhancing their connection to the spiritual realms.

2. Intrinsic Correspondences between Attributes and Desired Outcomes

Aethelred's attributes include an affinity for the element of Air, representing knowledge, communication, and the connection between the physical and spiritual planes. It also possesses a strong connection to the Avalonian ancestors, serving as a bridge between the practitioner and aspects of the Avalon Working tradition.

3. Mystical Connections

Aethelred is linked to several symbols, sigils, and mystical elements within Avalon Working, such as:

- The Silver Torc: Symbolizing the practitioner's commitment to mastering the esoteric arts and the authority conferred upon them by the Avalonian ancestors.
- The Triskelion: Representing the tripartite nature of the servitor's function, as well as the merging of the past, present, and future.
- Glastonbury Tor: A sigil invoking the energy and spiritual power of the sacred Avalonian site.

4. Ritual for Servitor Creation

To create the Aethelred servitor, follow these steps:
**Step 1**: Establish correspondence by performing the Casting of the Avalon circle ritual, surrounding yourself with the energies of the Avalonian landscape.
**Step 2**: Begin by meditating on your intentions and visualizing the desired outcome.
**Step 3**: Craft Aethelred's sigil, incorporating the Silver Torc, the Triskelion, and the Glastonbury Tor symbols.
**Step 4**: Engage in a ceremony invoking the Avalonian ancestors, stating your intentions and asking for their guidance and support.
**Step 5**: Meditate on the sigil, charging it with your energy, intention, and the energy of the elemental forces. Breathe life into the servitor and imbue it with a purpose.
**Step 6**: Once the servitor has been charged and activated, carefully store the sigil in a consecrated and secure space.

5. Invoking and Directing Aethelred's Powers

To invoke Aethelred's powers, meditate on its sigil, visualizing the connection between yourself, the servitor, and the spiritual forces it represents. Recite an incantation designed to funnel your intention and desires through the servitor, empowering it to act on your behalf and manifest the desired outcome.

6. Safeguards and Dissolution Techniques

Once the servitor's objectives have been achieved, it is crucial to employ safeguards and dissolution techniques. **Follow these steps**:
**Step 1**: Encircle the sigil with a circle of salt, symbolizing dissolution and purification.
**Step 2**: Meditate on the servitor, expressing gratitude for its assistance, then clearly visualize it being released from its tasks and purpose.
**Step 3**: Verbally revoke any authority bestowed upon the servitor and command it to disperse its energy back to its elemental origin.
**Step 4**: Burn the sigil, releasing the servitor and its energy back to the universe, freeing both you and the entity of any lingering connection.

Following these steps ensures that Aethelred is used responsibly and ethically within Avalon Working practices.
