## I. Preamble

As practitioners of Playing God, wielding the powers of esotericism, occultism, and arcane arts, we recognize our immense responsibility in creating and manipulating life and interacting with otherworldly beings. Thus, a moral code to guide our actions and ensure the ethical practice of our arts is imperative. The following outline seeks to establish a comprehensive moral code to be adhered to by practitioners in all aspects of our work, emphasizing symbology, alchemy, and spiritual principles.

### II. Creation and Manipulation of Life

1. **Respect for Life**: A practitioner must always treat life in all its forms with respect, never creating or manipulating life solely for their own amusement or to cause harm.
   - E.g., Creating a homunculus to perform household chores is acceptable, while creating one to harm others is forbidden.

2. **Intent and Purpose**: A practitioner shall only create or manipulate life with a defined, ethical purpose.
   - E.g., The "Elixir of Life" ritual is permitted for healing and rejuvenation but must not be used for the sole pursuit of immortality.

3. **Balance and Nature**: When creating or altering life, the practitioner must ensure that their actions do not disrupt the delicate balance of nature and the natural order.

4. **Consent and Will**: The practitioner must not manipulate or dominate another living being against its will, nor should they force the creation of new life without mindful consideration.

### III. Interactions with Otherworldly Beings

1. **Respect and Humility**: Practitioners shall approach interactions with otherworldly beings with respect, humility, and a genuine desire for harmonious cooperation.
   - E.g., Seeking the counsel of an elemental spirit for guidance on a matter requires deference and acknowledgement of their wisdom.

2. **Truth and Honesty**: The practitioner must always maintain truth and honesty in their dealings with otherworldly beings, never attempting to deceive or manipulate them for personal gain.
   - E.g., A practitioner who summons a demon must be upfront about their intentions and the terms of any agreement made.

3. **Boundaries and Rights**: When engaging with otherworldly beings, the practitioner must respect their rights and the boundaries that separate our realms.

### IV. Consequences of Breaching the Code

1. **Personal Responsibility**: Practitioners who violate the moral code take full responsibility for the consequences of their actions, including the potential harm to themselves and others.
   - E.g., A practitioner who creates a monstrous being that escapes and causes destruction will be held accountable for the damages.

2. **Karmic Repercussions**: A practitioner shall be aware that breaching the moral code may result in karmic consequences that manifest not only within this lifetime, but in subsequent incarnations as well.

3. **Loss of Power and Abilities**: A practitioner who repeatedly disregards this moral code risks losing their power and abilities, as the universal forces that govern our practice may revoke access to the esoteric and occult arts.

### V. Conclusion

With this moral code governing the practice of Playing God in the realms of esotericism and occultism, we strive to uphold the highest standards of ethics and ensure the responsible use of our abilities. By adhering to these principles, we maintain the balance between the realms of man and the supernatural and ensure a harmonious coexistence of life in all its diverse forms.
