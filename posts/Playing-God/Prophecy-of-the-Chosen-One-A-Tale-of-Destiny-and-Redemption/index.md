In the darkest hour of the waning moon,
The birth of the chosen one shall presage doom,
In the kingdom where once thrived light,
A hero emerges amidst fright.

Born of blood, tempered by fire,
They shall be drawn to the ethereal spire,
The Scepter of Shadows to wield,
Whispers of betrayal concealed.

By the crest of Aternoctis, darkness shall descend,
Marking the beginning of the hero's end,
The nemesis of ancient times will reprise,
A bitter conflict of old lies.

The titan's tear, a gem so blest,
Embedded in the heart of the hero's crest,
But hidden in the abyss of lost desires,
Tainted and cursed by the shadows of a distant pyre.

Bound by fate, the mythical companion appears,
Their loyalty, time's deepest fears,
Preternatural wisdom, their truest guide,
Yet eternally cursed by celestial divide.

In the hallowed halls of the cursed shrine,
Three trials will unveil the path malign:
The ravaging cerberus thirsts for blood,
The spectral serpent yearns for spirit's flood.

Emerging victorious from the final trial,
The hero faces the inescapable gyre,
The ancient nemesis and their ego's greed,
Instruments of the universe's dire creed.

In a pivotal moment of cruel deceit,
The hero's downfall is rendered complete,
Torn between loyalty and ambition's sting,
Their world alight with hatred's sing.

Yet salvation lays dormant in the prophecy's decree,
A choice to be made, to save or to flee,
For in the hero's darkest hour, heed the way,
Redemption lies, where the broken shadows sway.

Forewarned are the wise and beware the unhinged,
For the threads of destiny are raveled and singed,
The omen of the hero's demise and rise,
In unraveling their destiny, lies true demise.
