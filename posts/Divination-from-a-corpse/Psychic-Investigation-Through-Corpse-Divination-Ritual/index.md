First, I initiate the ritual by gathering the necessary esoteric tools and arranging them around the corpse in a specific pattern as dictated by the ancient art of divination from a corpse. I choose a ceremonial dagger imbued with the power to focus the energy of the ritual, a silver chalice filled with the blood of a black lamb to symbolize the rebirth of knowledge, and a book of the dead containing powerful invocations for summoning my spirit guides.

With everything in place, I begin chanting the incantations specific to this domain of divination. As my voice shifts and melds with otherworldly tones, the air grows colder, and the energy in the room intensifies. The spirits that guide and assist me appear before me as barely discernible outlines, ready to aid in the ritual at my command.

Turning my attention to the physical remains, I use my psychic abilities to look beyond the veil of death while conducting a thorough examination of the corpse. I take note of specific markings, physical damage, and spiritual residue, paying particular attention to anything that might indicate foul play or a struggle.

Once all the necessary information has been extracted, I engage my enhanced intuition to reconstruct a vivid mental image of the deceased's final moments. I enter into the victim’s emotional and mental states, experiencing their surroundings, relationships, and any suspects involved in their passing. Within the recesses of my mind, the entire scenario unfolds – giving me a detailed account of their last moments.

Finally, I emerge from the depths of my psychic exploration to record the narrative of the deceased's demise. I make note of every relevant plot point and analyze them further to ensure the reconstructed story is as accurate as possible. By doing so, I create a detailed chronicle of the deceased's last moments that can be used to discover the truth behind their fate.
