In order to address the knowledge challenge, we must first briefly lay the foundation by discussing key aspects involved - occult symbology, cross-cultural mythological comparisons, The Wild Adversary, and its esoteric and exoteric manifestations within human growth, societal development, and human enlightenment.

Occult symbology is the study and interpretation of symbols and symbolic meanings found in various religious, spiritual, and philosophical traditions. These symbols often hint at hidden or deeper layers of truth that can be connected across different cultural contexts. Cross-cultural mythological comparisons involve identifying the similarities and differences between myths, legends, and stories from diverse traditions, offering valuable insights into the human psyche and our shared history.

The Wild Adversary is the archetype of opposition, challenge, and transformation. Often depicted as a powerful force or entity, it serves as a catalyst for personal or societal growth and enlightenment. This is achieved by pushing individuals and communities to confront and overcome their own limitations and obstacles.

Now that we have established the basis, let us explore the ways in which The Wild Adversary influences personal growth, societal development, and human enlightenment, while examining its esoteric and exoteric manifestations.

Personal Growth:
The Wild Adversary serves as a mirror for an individual's fears, weaknesses, and inner conflicts. By reflecting these back at us, we are compelled to face and overcome them, leading to progress and self-improvement. On an esoteric level, this might involve confronting and integrating one's shadow (i.e., the unconscious aspects of the self), as seen in depth psychology and various spiritual practices. Exoterically, this could be depicted as a hero or heroine facing a series of trials and challenges that ultimately lead to their awakening or transformation - a prominent theme in mythological stories worldwide such as the Hero's Journey.

Societal Development:
The Wild Adversary's presence in society encourages innovation, change, and resilience. By challenging established norms, perspectives, and institutions, it forces a culture to reevaluate and adapt, leading to the development of new ideas and technologies. Esoterically, this may be represented by secret societies and traditions wielding the power of The Wild Adversary to pierce through conventional thought and alter the course of history. Exoterically, the archetype can emerge through revolutionary figures and movements that overthrow oppressive systems, similar to the mythological stories of Prometheus or the American Revolution.

Human Enlightenment:
Through struggle, trial, and opposition, The Wild Adversary plays a crucial role in guiding humanity towards greater awareness and understanding of themselves, others, and the universe. At the esoteric level, the journey through challenge helps initiate the individual into a spiritual transformation or unveiling of hidden wisdom, catalyzing the process of enlightenment. Exoterically, this can be observed in various religious and philosophical traditions, where challenges and oppositions, such as the battles between light and dark, good and evil, lead to transcendent insights and ultimately, the attainment of salvation, liberation, or enlightenment.

In conclusion, The Wild Adversary, as a potent archetype of challenge and transformation throughout the worlds of occult symbology and cross-cultural mythological narratives, stands as a cornerstone in personal growth, societal development, and human enlightenment. Its influence in both esoteric and exoteric manifestations pervades various traditions and offers unique insights into our shared human experience. By acknowledging the necessity and importance of this force, we may learn to harness it to improve ourselves, progress our societies, and further our overall understanding of the nature of existence.
