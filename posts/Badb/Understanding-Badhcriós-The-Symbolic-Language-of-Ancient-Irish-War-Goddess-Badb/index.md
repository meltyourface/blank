The intricate symbolic language created to encompass the dark and enigmatic aspects of the ancient Irish goddess Badb is named "Badhcriós," meaning "Crow's Web" in Old Irish. Badhcriós is a web of interconnected symbols, each representing a different aspect of Badb's nature, battleground occurrences, and prophetic visions. The language's complexity deepens the practitioner's connection to the spirit of Badb and allows for rich and vivid discourse on topics such as spiritual warfare, bloodlust, and divine guidance.

Core Symbols:

1. **Cródh**: Representing the war deity aspect of Badb, the Cródh symbol features a stylized crow's head atop a spear. It stands for battle, chaos, strife, and the intoxicating nature of war.

2. **Badhcath**: Symbolizing Badb's role as a crow, Badhcath is an image of a crow in flight, with a deceptively sharp beak and talons. This symbol embodies transformation, adaptability, and the ability to navigate the complex terrain of the battlefield.

3. **Tairngreacht**: The prophetic symbol in Badhcriós, Tairngreacht is a set of three intricately intertwined circles, representing past, present, and future. This symbol captures the essence of Badb's abilities to foresee the outcomes of battles and guide her devotees towards the path of conquest and glory.

Secondary Symbols:

4. **Fhuilthirst**: This symbol, depicting a chalice filled with blood, signifies bloodlust and a thirst for vengeance, channeling Badb's fury and passion onto the battlefield.

5. **Tuathlus**: Representing the spiritual warfare aspect, Tuathlus showcases a shield surrounded by ethereal flames, invoking the idea of divine protection and the ability to overcome one's enemies through strength of spirit.

6. **Na Taidhbhsí**: Symbolizing the connection between the living and the dead, Na Taidhbhsí is a pair of ghostly hands reaching out from the lower realms, highlighting the thin veil between the realms of existence during the heat of battle.

Using these core and secondary symbols, Badhcriós practitioners form complex phrases and sentences by weaving together the images, creating a visual language that speaks to the very essence of the goddess's dark nature. As the practitioner delves deeper into the rich tapestry of Badhcriós, they ignite a profound connection with the spirit of Badb herself, empowering them to tap into the raw, primal forces of war, chaos, and prophecy.
