**Explanation**:

The reasoning behind choosing the Eye of Horus as the most effective in warding off negative energies and evil influences within various cultural beliefs lies in its widespread usage, origin from a powerful mythology, and the strong symbolism attached to it. 

The Eye of Horus originates from ancient Egyptian mythology. Horus is considered one of the most powerful gods in their pantheon, representing the sky god and the divine manifestation of the sun and the moon. The Eye of Horus symbolizes protection, good health, and royal power, often incorporating lunar and solar symbolism. This emblem is often used as a protective amulet in various forms and infused with magic meant to ward off harm.

Apart from its strong symbolism, the Eye of Horus has been used in medicine and prevention of suffering throughout different cultures. This gives it high cultural adaptability and broad representation, which can attract positive energies while repelling negative influences.

Comparatively, the other options have limited cultural application:

- Horseshoes placed above doorways for good luck and protection can be found primarily in European cultures but don't have the same widespread use and strength of representation as the Eye of Horus.

- Dreamcatchers, originating from Native American cultures, aim to protect from nightmares and negativity during sleep, thus limiting their function in comparison to the Eye of Horus.

- The Abracadabra amulet diminishes in power with the reduction of letters in the triangular arrangement, illustrating a more transient form of protection.

In conclusion, the Eye of Horus is the most effective symbol regarding warding off negative energies and evil influences due to its strong symbolism, powerful origin, widespread usage, and adaptability across different cultures.
