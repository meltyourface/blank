The chronological progression of talismanic glyph engravings within the realm of Western esotericism can be divided into several key stages, each marked by distinct developments in design, technique, and underlying significance. 

1. Ancient and Classical Antiquity (circa 1500 BCE - 500 CE)
Talismanic engraving in the Western tradition finds its roots in the ancient cultures of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. The Egyptians and Mesopotamians utilized talismans engraved with hieroglyphs and cuneiform script, respectively, to invoke the protection and favor of their gods. The Greeks and Romans adapted these practices, incorporating their own pantheon of deities and philosophical concepts. Key materials used during this time included stone, bone, bronze, and gold.

2. Early Medieval Period (circa 500 - 1000 CE)
The fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity saw a shift in the function and design of engraved talismans. Early Christian symbols, such as the Chi-Rho, became prevalent, often in combination with older pagan motifs. The engravers of this period worked with simpler tools and materials, such as wood and brass, as the knowledge of working with more precious metals began to wane.

3. High and Late Medieval Period (circa 1000 - 1500 CE)
The medieval period saw the emergence of Kabbalistic and alchemical symbolism in talismanic engravings, as well as a return to the use of more precious materials like silver and gold. The Crusades facilitated a cross-pollination of ideas between Western and Islamic mystics, leading to the integration of Arabic script and geometric patterns in talisman design. The advent of the printing press also allowed for mass production and popularization of engraved talismans.

4. Renaissance and Early Modern Period (circa 1500 - 1800 CE)
The Renaissance brought a renewed interest in classical and occult wisdom, resulting in elaborate engravings featuring astrological, Hermetic, and Platonic symbols. Notable engravers from this period include masters like Agrippa and Dee, who crafted intricate designs and developed innovative techniques for working with diverse materials such as ivory, crystal, and ceramics. The emergence of secret societies, such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons, further contributed to the esoteric significance and dissemination of talismanic engravings.

5. Modern Period (circa 1800 - present)
The modern era has seen a synthesis of talismanic traditions from various historical and cultural contexts, with a focus on the psychological and archetypal aspects of the symbols employed. Artists like Eliphas Levi, Aleister Crowley, and Austin Osman Spare have left their mark on the evolution of talismanic engravings, introducing new systems of magick and utilizing updated tools and techniques for their creation.

Throughout these stages of development, talismanic engravings have been closely linked with other occult practices and mystical traditions, including Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, ceremonial magick, and Theosophy. These connections can often be discerned in the overlapping symbols and archetypal themes found in the engraved designs, highlighting the rich syncretism that characterizes Western esotericism as a whole.
