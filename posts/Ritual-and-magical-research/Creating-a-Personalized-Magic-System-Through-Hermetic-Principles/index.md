In order to address this knowledge challenge, let's begin by breaking it down into its core components, which are:

1. Discerning the synthesis and application of various ritual and magical paradigms.
2. Integrating Hermetic principles, including the mastery of polarity and correspondence.
3. Producing a coherent and potent system for personal transformation and manifestation.

By understanding these core components, we can formulate a comprehensive answer that reflects the complexity and depth of the topic. Our goal is to help the practitioner create a personalized system of magic and ritual based on Hermetic principles to achieve transformation and manifestation.

**1. Discerning the synthesis and application of various ritual and magical paradigms**

The esoteric, occult, and magical fields contain a wide array of systems, traditions, and paradigms. These can range from ancient systems like the Kabbalah, to more modern ones such as Chaos Magic. As a practitioner, it is essential to study and explore various paradigms in order to identify common threads and principles that can be synthesized into a coherent working system.

In order to discern the synthesis and application of various paradigms, a practitioner must:

- Study various traditions, including their history, theories, and practical applications.
- Identify key principles, symbols, and techniques that resonate with their personal worldview and spiritual understanding.
- Experiment with different practices to determine which methods and techniques are most effective and aligned with their personal goals.

**2. Integrating Hermetic principles, including the mastery of polarity and correspondence**

The Hermetic principles, originating from the ancient text The Kybalion, serve as a foundation for many esoteric and magical traditions. They consist of seven core principles: Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender. The mastery of polarity and correspondence are particularly relevant to the synthesis of a magical system.

- **Mastery of Polarity:** This principle focuses on the idea that everything has its opposite, and that we can harness the power of these opposites to create change. In a magical context, this can involve working with the forces of light and dark, positive and negative, and other polarities to balance and harmonize energy within oneself and the environment.

- **Mastery of Correspondence:** The principle of correspondence states that all things are interconnected and reflect each other â€“ "as above, so below; as within, so without." This principle allows the magician to draw upon the symbolic relationships between objects, actions, and concepts to create desired effects and manifestations. For example, by using specific colors, herbs, and symbols that correspond to a specific intention, the practitioner can create a powerful ritual or spell that resonates with the desired outcome.

**3. Producing a coherent and potent system for personal transformation and manifestation**

Having discerned the synthesis and application of various paradigms and integrated Hermetic principles, the practitioner can now create a personalized system of magic and ritual. To do so, they should:

- Develop a clear understanding of their personal beliefs, goals, and intentions for engaging in magical practices.
- Create a structured framework that incorporates their synthesized understanding of various paradigms, while adhering to core Hermetic principles.
- Continuously evaluate their system and practices, making necessary adjustments based on their experiences and personal growth.

In conclusion, a practitioner can discern the synthesis and application of various ritual and magical paradigms by studying and experimenting with different systems and traditions. Integrating the Hermetic principles of polarity and correspondence adds a structured foundation to this synthesized system. With this framework, the practitioner can produce a coherent and potent system of personal transformation and manifestation that is tailored to their unique worldview, goals, and spiritual understanding. This personalized approach enables the practitioner to fully harness the power of their esoteric and magical practice, leading to profound personal growth and transformation.
