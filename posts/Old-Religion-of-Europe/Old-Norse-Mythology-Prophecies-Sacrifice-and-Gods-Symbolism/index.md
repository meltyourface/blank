  [Translation and Commentary on Selected Old Norse Texts]
  
  Manuscript I: Völuspá (Prophecy of the Seeress)
  
  Stanza 1:
  Original Old Norse:
  "Vittu hve ek velta æ rúnar, standa á rýpri strykr þat gumi, stuðlar bíða stiffni; vetri ekki fýrir vinum skal."
  
  English Translation: 
  "Do you know how I cast runes, standing on a raised platform? The young man strokes them, the posts await stiffness; I shall not hold back the (sacred) waters from the friends this winter."
  
  Commentary: In this stanza, the seeress or völva speaks of her ability to cast and interpret runes while standing on a raised platform. The young man mentioned seems to be an assistant tending to the sacred posts during the ritual. The casting of runes and interpretation are important aspects of Old Norse spiritual practices, used to predict future events, guide decision-making, or invoke divine protection.
  
  Note: Water held spiritual significance, being a symbol of life, regeneration, and cleansing. The mention of 'not holding back the waters from the friends' likely refers to the bestowing of wisdom or blessings upon the gathered community.
  
  Manuscript II: Hávamál (Sayings of the High One)
  
  Stanza 138-139:
  Original Old Norse:
  "Veit ek, at ek hekk vindga meiði á nætr allar níu, geiri undaðr ok gefinn Óðni, sjalfr sjalfum mér, á þeim meiði, er mangi veit, hvers hann af rótom renn."
  
  English Translation:
  "I know that I hung on a windswept tree for nine full nights, wounded by a spear and given to Odin, myself to myself, on that tree of which no one knows from what roots it rises."
  
  Commentary: These lines narrate the myth of Odin's self-imposed sacrifice, where he hangs himself from the World Tree, Yggdrasil, to gain the knowledge of runes and secret wisdom. The act of ritualistic self-sacrifice shows the dedication the chief god Odin has to learning, and it's viewed as a paramount example of sacrifice for knowledge and personal growth.
  
  Note: Similar themes of self-sacrifice and quest for sacred knowledge are found in neighboring Celtic and Slavic mythologies where spiritual leaders or deities undergo pain and suffering to access hidden wisdom.
  
  Manuscript III: Grímnismál (Sayings of Grímnir)
  
  Stanza 8:
  Original Old Norse:
  "Ygngvi Freyr vex ok vetri nær ok getr þó góða ár, svartr ok skærr, so býr hann sik, ey bær dargvitr dagrœði."
  
  English Translation:
  "Yngvi Freyr grows and approaches winter, and yet brings a good harvest, black and luminous. Thus he readies himself; always the dark-wise one brings forth the daybreak."
  
  Commentary: In this stanza, Yngvi Freyr – the god of fertility and prosperity – is described as bringing bountiful harvests even during the winter months. His association with both light and darkness symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and seasonal changes, a frequent motif in Old European religions. 
  
  Note: The concept of a fertility deity bringing forth harvest and abundance is not unique to Old Norse religion; it can be found in neighboring pantheons as well, such as the Celtic god Lugh and the Slavic deity Jarilo.
