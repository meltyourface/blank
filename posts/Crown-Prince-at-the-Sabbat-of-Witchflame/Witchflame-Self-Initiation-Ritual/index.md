The Witchflame Self-Initiation Ceremony

Preparation

1. Choose an appropriate location, ideally outdoors under the light of the full moon or in a space that has been hallowed by the Witchflame energies.

2. Set up the ritual area by creating a sacred circle with a diameter of 9 feet, demarcated by candles at the four cardinal points (north, east, south, and west).

3. Place an altar at the center, adorned with symbols and sacred items relevant to the Witchflame Path, such as athame (ritual knife), chalice, pentacle, wand, and Crown Prince sigil.

4. Prepare a ceremonial robe or garment, symbolic of the aspirant's devotion to the Witchflame Path, to be worn during the ritual.

5. Write a personal declaration of intent, expressing the aspirant's dedication to the Crown Prince and their commitment to the Witchflame Path.

The Ceremony

1. Begin the ceremony by lighting the candles in a clockwise direction, starting from the east. As each candle is lit, recite the corresponding invocation:

**East**: "By the powers of air, I call upon the fierce winds to carry my intention to the Crown Prince of Witchflame."
South: "By the powers of fire, I call upon the eternal flame to ignite my spirit and align me with the Witchflame Path."
West: "By the powers of water, I call upon the flowing tides to cleanse my soul and prepare me for this sacred journey."
North: "By the powers of earth, I call upon the steadfast earth to ground me and grant me strength in my devotion."

2. Stand before the altar, facing west, and undergo a moment of deep introspection. Contemplate the reasons for seeking initiation, the wisdom to be gained, and the personal transformation to be embraced.

3. Read the declaration of intent aloud, reciting each word with conviction and unwavering resolve. Then, light the declaration on fire using the southern candle, and place the burning paper in a fireproof dish.

4. Holding the athame, draw the sigil of the Crown Prince on your chest, using the energy of the tool rather than physically cutting the skin. Visualize the sigil's glow, sealing your commitment to the Witchflame Path.

5. Raise the chalice to the sky, and recite the following invocation:

"O Crown Prince at the Sabbat of Witchflame, I stand before you as an aspirant of your sacred mysteries. By the powers of air, fire, water, and earth, I now invoke your blessings and affirm my allegiance. Let this chalice be the vessel of my devotion, and as I drink from its depths, so too shall I drink from the well of your wisdom."

Slowly sip the liquid within the chalice, savoring each drop as a testament to your devotion.

6. Don the ceremonial robe or garment, symbolizing the shedding of the deceptive persona and the emergence of a devoted disciple of the Witchflame Path.

7. Stand at the center of the circle, arms outstretched, and recite the following affirmation:

"In the name of the Crown Prince at the Sabbat of Witchflame, I accept my newfound place as an initiate of the Witchflame Path. No longer bound by the limitations of my former life, I stand ready to evolve, to learn, to grow, to serve, and to honor the ancient wisdoms and sacred mysteries imparted upon me from this day forth."

8. Close the ceremony by extinguishing the candles in a counterclockwise direction, starting from the east, and giving thanks to the elements and the Crown Prince for their presence and blessings.

The Witchflame Self-Initiation Ceremony is now complete. With unwavering resolve and devotion, the aspirant has embarked on a journey of transformation and self-discovery under the guidance of the Crown Prince at the Sabbat of Witchflame.
