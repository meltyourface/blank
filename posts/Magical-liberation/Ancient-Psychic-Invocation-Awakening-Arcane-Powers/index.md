  Harmonizing with the cosmic energy that flows,
  Awaken the senses, let the psychic powers grow.
  Into the trance, prepared to enhance,
  Connect with the ancient and take this chance.
  
  By the grace of A'ishoh, the Seer of Fates,
  Forging a link through the mental gates.
  In the power of Elocin, the Psychic Queen,
  A force of pure light, her clarity shows within.
  
  Align with Ignarun, the Dreamweaver's grace,
  With synchronicity guiding us through time and space.
  Through these Arcane beings, the psychic path is bestowed,
  Open the gates, so the wisdom may flow.
  
  In Rajukinn we trust, meaning clarity of sight,
  Yisodenna for feeling, a compass of inner light.
  Onorak's gift, a language that's secret and pure,
  Discerning unseen truths with the wisdom of yore.
  
  In a rhythm of three, to enter the trance,
  Breathe in the power, for the senses to enhance.
  Inhale-exhale, and mindfully count,
  Repeat the words, let the energy mount.
  
  A'ishoh, Elocin, Ignarun, we invoke thee,
  Rajukinn, Yisodenna, Onorak, set us free.
  In rhythm and rhyme, the powers entwine,
  The chant is complete, let our psychic skills shine.
