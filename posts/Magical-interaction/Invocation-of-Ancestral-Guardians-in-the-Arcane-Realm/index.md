In the twilight's embrace, 'neath the watchful skies,
I call upon the ancient powers within the veiled guise.
From the depth of the fathomless realms, near and far,
Unfurl the sacred tapestry of lore, the gates ajar.

Diaphanous whispers of time, etchings engraved,
In the sanctum of mysteries, where the wise have braved.
The bastion celestial, the hallowed site revered,
The conflux of enchantments, whence elements cohere.

By air, the zephyr's breath, that knows of no bound,
Entwines the mind's essence, its wisdom profound.
By fire, the primordial flame, the soul's ardent desire,
Ignites the fervent passion, to transcend, to aspire.

By water, the ebbing tide, the wellspring of life,
Bestows the soothing whispers, amidst chaos and strife.
By earth, the nurturing soil, the foundation of birth,
Anchors the ancient legacy, the roots to the earth.

From the infinite abyss, I awaken the ancestral call,
To summon guardians eternal, the sentinels that enthrall.
Azure Serpent of wisdom, enshrouded in swirling mists,
Emerald Griffin aloft, o'er the verdant land it persists.

Crimson Phoenix aflame, catalyst of rebirth and renewal,
Silvery Gorgon, concealing wisdom, behind a gaze so cruel.
Heed my plea, o' mighty dwellers of the arcane domain,
Unleash thy divine essence, amalgamate, and sustain.

In harmony we gather, on this enchanted ground,
To awaken the slumbering forces, immersed, profound.
Within this nucleus of sorcery, there lies a convergence,
An altar of unfathomable magic, a shrine of resurgence.

Undying and eternal, this testament to the archetype,
We celebrate and harness, these forces and energies that unite.
I beseech thee, o' divine spirits, this plea to humbly accept,
To guard this hallowed site, its sanctity for time to protect.
