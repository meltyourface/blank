In order to address this knowledge challenge and draw a comparison between the use of runes in Swedish cunning-folk traditions (trolldom) and their role in broader Scandinavian magical practices, we need to cover three main aspects: historical context, cultural exchange, and symbolic meanings.

Historical Context:
Runes were an essential component of magic and religion in ancient Scandinavia, being first attested around 2000 years ago. These runic alphabets were primarily used for writing short messages and marking possessions but gradually evolved into mystical purposes as well. Scandinavia consisted of various tribes and cultures, including the Vikings, which used runes as part of their seer and shamanic practices.

Swedish cunning-folk traditions, however, represent a more recent period in history, mainly during the late medieval and early modern eras (14th-18th centuries). Trolldom was a practice that entailed folk magic, spells, and healing, as well as predicting the future. It relied on various methods for achieving these goals, including the use of runes, symbols, herbs, and spoken incantations. So while the origin of runes predates trolldom, their use in Swedish cunning-folk tradition is inherited from earlier Scandinavian magical practices.

Cultural Exchange:
The connection between ancient Scandinavian magical practices and the later Swedish cunning-folk tradition can be attributed to various factors. In ancient times, the Norse culture was dispersed through trade, military expeditions, and settlements, leading to the dissemination of the runic script and magical practices across the Norse cultural sphere. As the Viking Age ended, their influence was still present in the Nordic region, including Sweden.

Swedish cunning-folk traditions were influenced by these historical, cultural, and linguistic ties with ancient Scandinavian practices, including the use and interpretation of runes. Nevertheless, trolldom in Sweden also absorbed elements from other cultures, such as German and English sources of folk magic, adding further layers of complexity and nuance to these practices.

Symbolic Meanings:
In ancient Scandinavian magical practices, runes were often used to cast spells by inscribing them on stones, wood, or other objects (such as the runestones found across Scandinavia). These runes denoted spiritual, physical, or energetic forces, creating connections between the practitioner and the desired outcomes of their magical workings.

In trolldom, runes played a similar role, linking the practitioner with various energies and spirits, invoking protection, guidance, or healing. However, the focus of the Swedish cunning-folk often leaned more towards specific, everyday practical concerns, such as love, luck, and fertility. While runic symbols were still used, the practitioners would also incorporate a diverse array of other materials (e.g., herbs, powders, and animal remains), as well as employing rituals, incantations, and/or recipes, often emphasizing oral and written transmission of the knowledge.

In summary, runes played a vital role in both ancient Scandinavian magical practices and the later Swedish cunning-folk traditions. The connection between the two lies in shared historical roots, drawing from the regional connections within the Nordic area and the blending of ancient Norse practices into the subsequent Swedish cultures. The key differences lie in the evolution of focus and methods, as Swedish trolldom adapted to practical, everyday concerns and absorbed influences from other sources, while still maintaining its links with ancient magical traditions through the use of runes.
