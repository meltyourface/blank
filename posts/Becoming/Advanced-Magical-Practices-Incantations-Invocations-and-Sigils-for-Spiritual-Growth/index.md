description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Becoming, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a series of elaborate and potent incantations, invocations, and sigils tailored for the purpose of accelerating spiritual metamorphosis and mastering the arcane art of Becoming. Employ diverse esoteric traditions, symbology, and techniques to ensure the efficacy and potency of the crafted enchantments. Devise different levels of complexity to accommodate both novices and adepts, fostering personal growth and ever-increasing mastery over the mysteries of the unseen.

Level 1: Novice

Incantation: "Anima evolutio, vox aeternum, veritas revelare!"

Invocation: Stand facing east, with your arms raised at shoulder width, forming a "V" with your palms facing outward. Close your eyes and envision a brilliant white light surrounding your body. Recite the incantation three times, breathing deeply and drawing the energy of the light into your being. Open your eyes and visualize your spirit evolving as you embody the truth of your existence.

Sigil: Draw a circle encompassing an upward-pointing triangle. Within the triangle, place the runes Fehu (for wealth of knowledge), Uruz (for strength and transformation), and Thurisaz (for awakening consciousness).

Level 2: Intermediate

Incantation: "Divinae sapiens, serpenita ascendere, ignis initium!"

Invocation: Begin in a seated position, facing west. Place your hands on your knees, palms facing upward. Close your eyes and envision a golden serpent ascending from the base of your spine, winding its way up and illuminating each of your chakras. As it reaches the crown chakra, recite the incantation three times, feeling the serpent's wisdom and power fill your being. 

Sigil: Draw a circle encompassing a Svastika, the arms bent either clockwise or counterclockwise, signifying the turning of the wheel of life and transformation. At each bend, place the following symbols: Pentacle (for grounding and balance), Caduceus (for wisdom and divine communication), Ankh (for eternal life), and Ouroboros (for cyclical nature and infinite transformation).

Level 3: Adept

Incantation: "Noctem aperire, stella tenebris, animus unicus, lux et umbra!"

Invocation: On the night of a new moon, step outside and face the clear sky. Stand in a comfortable stance, with your arms by your sides. Close your eyes, and take deep, slow breaths as you attune yourself to the stillness of the night. Once you feel connected to the surrounding energies, slowly raise your arms above your head, palms facing the sky. Open your eyes and recite the incantation, feeling the darkness and light within your soul intertwine and expand your innate abilities.

Sigil: Create a circle, with an eight-pointed star within it. At each point of the star, place these symbols: Eye of Horus (for protection and insight), Lotus (for purity and spiritual growth), Merkaba (for divine light and spiritual ascension), Triskelion (for progress and personal growth), Bindu (for unity and transformation), Hexagram (for cosmic balance), Vesica Piscis (for interconnectedness and duality) and Yin-Yang (for harmony in polarities).
