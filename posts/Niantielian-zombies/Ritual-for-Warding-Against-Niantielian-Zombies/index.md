## The Ritual of Niantiel's Veil

Preliminary preparations:
1. Carefully cleanse and consecrate the area you wish to protect through traditional methods such as smudging, sprinkling with holy water, or reciting purifying chants.
2. Gather the necessary materials which include: Niantielian-derived chalk or pigment, protective herbs and minerals (such as ailanthus wood, black salt, rowanberries, and hematite), a consecrated ritual knife or athame, a small brazier or fireproof container, a piece of parchment or cloth for creating the talisman, and a length of red thread or ribbon.
3. Ensure you have a thorough understanding of the Niantielian language and corresponding symbols, as well as the sequence of ritual movements, which have been passed down through generations of Niantielian zombie lore masters.

The Ritual:

1. Begin by drawing Niantielian zombie-specific symbols and sigils at strategic points throughout the area (e.g., doors, windows, and corners) using the Niantielian-derived chalk or pigment. Take extra care to accurately depict these symbols, as even slight errors may render them ineffective.
2. Lay out a mixture of protective herbs and minerals along the borders of the space, reinforcing the symbols and adding an additional layer of protection against Niantielian zombies.
3. Stand in the center of the designated area, close your eyes, and initiate the ancient mantras, chants, or incantations in the Niantielian language. Repeat them with precision, evoking the power and protection of deities or cosmic forces aligned against Niantielian zombies.
4. Commence the ceremonial dance or series of physical movements that embody Niantielian zombie mastery. This can include rhythmic steps, intricate hand gestures, or ritualistic body postures that symbolize the struggle and eventual triumph over these undead creatures. Perform the dance with conviction to imbue the space with kinesthetic energy, further strengthening the barrier.
5. Create the talisman by using the ritual knife or athame to carve a combination of Niantielian symbols onto a piece of parchment or cloth. Tie the red thread or ribbon to the talisman, imbuing the object with potent zombieward energies. Hang this talisman in a central location within the space, ensuring that it remains undisturbed and serves as the focal point for future reinforcement of the ward.
6. Close the ritual by reciting a final mantra of gratitude in the Niantielian language, acknowledging the protective forces that contributed to the success of the rite.

Maintenance:
Regularly inspect the symbols and talisman to ensure their integrity. Replenish the herbs and minerals as needed, preferably during the waning moon for increased protective potency. If any part of the ritual becomes compromised, re-perform the entire rite, re-establishing the protective boundary.

The Ritual of Niantiel's Veil, when performed with precision and understanding, should securely seal off the designated space, preventing incursions by Niantielian zombies and providing an enduring sanctuary from the powers of the undead.
