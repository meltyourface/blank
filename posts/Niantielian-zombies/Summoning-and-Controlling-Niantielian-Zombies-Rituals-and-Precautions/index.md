## Chapter 6: Niantielian Zombies: Origins, Abilities, Rituals, and Control

### Section 6.1: Origins of Niantielian Zombies

Niantielian zombies, an enigmatic and powerful being in the realm of occult studies, have their roots tracing back to the ancient Sumerian and Babylonian civilizations. These creatures were believed to be the undead servants of the god Niantiel, the deity of death, chaos, and forbidden knowledge. Considered neither as inherently good nor evil, Niantielian zombies were primarily seen as instruments fulfilling the will of their master.

Historically, priests and sorcerers who sought power, influence, or vengeance in their societies invoked these creatures and often directed them to carry out tasks that required immense strength or the completion of highly dangerous missions. Furthermore, the presence of Niantielian zombies was thought to blur the boundary between life and death, hence challenging our fundamental understanding of reality and the forces of the universe.

### Section 6.2: Abilities of Niantielian Zombies

Niantielian zombies possess extraordinary abilities that set them apart from other undead creatures. Some primary traits include:

1. Enhanced strength: Their physical prowess allows them to accomplish feats that surpass human capabilities.

2. Imperviousness to pain: As beings that straddle life and death, they are unaffected by pain and physical injury, making them valuable warriors and servants.

3. Heightened senses: Their senses are enhanced, enabling them to detect the presence of humans and other entities with heightened accuracy.

4. Deathly aura: The mere presence of Niantielian zombies causes unease and fear among the living, often instigating chaos and confusion in their surroundings.

5. Reanimation: These creatures can resurrect the dead, converting them into more Niantielian zombies and thereby multiplying their numbers, when required.

### Section 6.3: Rituals to Summon Niantielian Zombies

To summon a Niantielian zombie, a practitioner must complete the following steps:

1. Prepare a sacred space: Find an isolated space and cleanse it with a potion made of vervain, salt, and frankincense. Draw a pentagram on the ground, large enough to accommodate the zombie and the practitioner. Place lit candles at each point of the pentagram.

2. Create a focus on the altar: On the altar within the pentagram, place personal items belonging to the deceased individual whom you wish to summon as a Niantielian zombie. Also, include a representation of Niantiel, such as an idol or painting.

3. Invocation: Chant the following incantation during the waning crescent moon:

“Niantiel, lord of chaos and secrets deep,
With whispered words, your servant I seek
From realms beyond, your power wield,
Raise the fallen, let the shadows unseal.”

Recite the incantation multiple times, increasing the intensity with each repetition. As the energy in the room starts to surge, begin pouring the blood of a black goat into a bowl on the altar.

4. The arrival of the Niantielian zombie: With the culmination of the ritual, the summoned Niantielian zombie should manifest within the confines of the pentagram.

### Section 6.4: Methods to Control and Ward Off Niantielian Zombies

Controlling Niantielian zombies can be a precarious endeavor, as it relies heavily on the practitioner’s knowledge, skill, and dedication to the task. Creating a magical amulet is the most common approach to establishing control. Imbued with the practitioner’s intent and power, the amulet should be worn by the zombie during its servitude.

To ward off or protect against these creatures, work with powerful protective entities, such as placing sigils or talismans around your residence. A blend of beeswax, myrrh, and dragon’s blood, known as the Elixir of Niantiel, can be applied on doors and entry points to keep these beings at bay.

Lastly, to sever your connection with the Niantielian zombie and banish it back to its realm, perform a reversal ritual. Repeat the summoning incantation with an added phrase:

“Niantiel, my bidding now done,
By your leave, let darkness be undone.
Return thy servant to the void,
Our bond now breaks, thy power uncoiled.”

In conclusion, trafficking with Niantielian zombies requires great caution, dedication, and a profound understanding of the principles of occult knowledge. Mastery of these creatures will offer the practitioner an undeniable advantage in pursuing their objectives, but must always remember the consequences of invoking such formidable forces.
