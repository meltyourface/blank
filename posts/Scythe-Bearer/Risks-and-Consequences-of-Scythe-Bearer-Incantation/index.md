In order to fulfill this task, I have thoroughly investigated the consequences of invoking the ancient Scythe-Bearer incantation "Necrofuscus Oculus" on both the ethereal realm's inhabitants and the energy equilibrium of the astral plane. I have also taken into consideration the potential adverse effects on interdimensional stability and the manner in which spiritual entities may be influenced or disrupted by this arcane sorcery. 

1. **Effect on Ethereal Realm Inhabitants**: Invoking "Necrofuscus Oculus" can have significant repercussions on the denizens of the ethereal realm. As the incantation affects the ethereal energy flow, entities that rely on this energy for sustenance or communication might suffer temporary disruption or even long-term damage. Creatures like ghosts, spirits, and ethereal beings might find their connection to other planes partially severed and experience disorientation or even loss of power.

2. **Energy Equilibrium of the Astral Plane**: The chaotic energy of "Necrofuscus Oculus" is primarily directed towards the astral plane. This can lead to temporary fluctuations in the energy balance or even permanent disturbances if the incantation is cast frequently or without regard for the harmonic equilibrium. Astral travelers may find themselves in precarious situations due to these fluctuations and may experience unpredictable manifestations of illusory hazards or challenges.

3. **Interdimensional Stability**: While the incantation was not originally intended to cause fracturing or warping of the interdimensional fabric, its unfocused nature has the potential to weaken the structure of reality if used irresponsibly. Unstabilized portals or rifts could form, leading to the risk of unintentional merging or overlapping of realms. This might result in unforeseen consequences such as the release of dangerous or destructive extra-dimensional creatures.

4. **Influence on Spiritual Entities**: The arcane energy contained within "Necrofuscus Oculus" may disrupt or corrupt spiritual entities, transforming them into malevolent or unpredictable beings. Such entities could become unbound to their original purpose and seek revenge or destruction upon those who infringed on their existence. Even seemingly benevolent spirits might succumb to the influence of the incantation and be driven to cause harm.

Given these potential risks and consequences, it is crucial that the Scythe-Bearer exercise caution and prudence when invoking the "Necrofuscus Oculus" incantation. Its use must be reserved for dire situations where the benefits outweigh the potential costs. In any case, the Scythe-Bearer should be prepared to cope with the after-effects of their actions and accept responsibility for maintaining the delicate balance of the universe.
