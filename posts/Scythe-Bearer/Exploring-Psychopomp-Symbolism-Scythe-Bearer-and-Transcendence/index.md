To address this knowledge challenge, we will explore the context of the Scythe-Bearer as a psychopomp figure, its symbolism related to the cyclic nature of existence, and the contrasting occult and esoteric schools of thought around it. We will then see how these different perspectives contribute to a holistic understanding of transcendence and personal growth.

The Scythe-Bearer is a psychopomp, which means that it is a guide for the souls of the deceased. In various cultures and religions, psychopomps are known to escort souls to the afterlife. Scythe-Bearer also represents the cyclic nature of existence, where life and death are intertwined and inseparable. This idea can be found in many religious and philosophical traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and ancient Greek mythology.

There are two main schools of thought regarding Scythe-Bearer within the occult and esoteric realm: the exoteric or outer approach, which focuses on rituals, symbols and outer practices; and the esoteric or inner approach, which emphasizes personal transformation and self-discovery through meditation, contemplation, and self-reflection. 

The exoteric approach to Scythe-Bearer often places a strong emphasis on various rituals, symbols, and practices related to the figure. These may include ceremonies to honor the dead, offerings to the spirit world, and the use of various symbols and talismans to represent the power of the Scythe-Bearer. This external focus is believed to provide practitioners with a tangible connection to the divine and to the spiritual realms, allowing them to harness their energies for both practical and spiritual purposes.

On the other hand, the esoteric school of thought has a more introspective perspective that focuses on the individual's personal connection to Scythe-Bearer and the spiritual realms. Here, the primary goal is not to perform rituals or use symbols, but rather to discover one's true self by exploring the depths of one's consciousness. This approach often involves meditation, contemplation, and self-reflection, which allows the individual to delve into their hidden desires, fears, and aspirations. Through this process, they seek to develop a deeper understanding of their connection to the Scythe-Bearer and how it can provide them with insights into the cyclic nature of existence and the meaning of life and death.

Although these two approaches may initially seem quite distinct and even contradictory, they ultimately work together to help individuals develop a unified understanding of transcendence and personal growth. The exoteric approach offers an outer framework to channel one's efforts, while the esoteric approach supplies the inner guidance to develop a genuine personal transformation. Together, both approaches provide practitioners with a holistic spiritual path that allows them to explore the mysteries of life, death, and transcendence.

In summary, the Scythe-Bearer serves as a psychopomp figure and symbolizes the cyclic nature of existence. **Two main schools of thought surround this entity**: the exoteric which focuses on rituals and symbols, and the esoteric which emphasizes personal transformation. Both schools of thought contribute to a deeper, unified understanding of transcendence and personal growth. By understanding and incorporating both of these approaches into their practice, individuals can develop a more holistic and meaningful spiritual journey.
