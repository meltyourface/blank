To perform a comprehensive analysis of the historical roots, interconnected cultural influences, and the archetypal portrayal of the vampire figure, we need to start by examining its preternatural origins and how those evolved over time. Then, we will explore the various cultural influences that created a mosaic of vampire myths and stories across the world. Finally, we will delve into the evolution of the vampire through literature and cinema, particularly focusing on the psychological underpinnings that drive our fascination with these undead beings.

1. Preternatural Origins: 
The concept of a vampire-like being has ancient roots, with mythological tales of creatures possessing characteristics akin to vampires found across many civilizations. For example, Lamashtu from Sumerian mythology, Lilith from Jewish mysticism, and Strix from Ancient Rome, to name a few. The undead or revenants have also been mentioned in epics and scriptures that date as far back as Ancient Greece and are even referenced in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

These historical myths and stories often involve demonic beings who drink blood, drain life force, or bring harm to the living. Through time and the interchange of different myths, the notion of a vampire-like creature became more common.

2. Interconnected Cultural Influences:
The complex interplay of cultural influences comes from various nations and regions adapting the vampire myth to fit their own folklore and traditions, often as a way to explain superstitions or societal fears. 

For instance, in Slavic mythology, the flayed horseman, an immortal being, shares many similarities with the vampire. In Eastern Europe, the fear of vampires grew in tandem with increased vampire hysteria, fueled by beliefs that the dead might rise from their graves. The origin of the term ‘vampire’ can be attributed to European countries such as Serbia and Croatia (‘vampir’) during the 18th century.

It is also important to note the influence of the medieval Catholic Church, which considered these demonic beings as personifications of heretics and enemies of the established faith. By incorporating elements from paganism, folk beliefs, and church doctrines, those who were believed to be vampires could be viewed as threats that needed to be controlled and eradicated.

3. Psychological Underpinnings:
The vampire myth also plays on our innate fascination with eternal life, immortality, and the power that comes with them. These sinister bloodsuckers represent the allure of temptation and the dangers of undying beauty. They embody both a seductive and destructive power, representing the darker sides of human nature, such as our hedonistic desires, fears of the unknown, and our curiosity about life after death.

4. The Evolution of the Vampire in Literature and Cinema:
The earliest portrayal of vampires in literature was in the form of blood-craving monsters that instilled paralyzing fear in people. However, towards the end of the 18th century, with the publication of "The Vampyre" by John Polidori, the vampire transformed from a grotesque monster into a refined, aristocratic being.

Bram Stoker's iconic novel, "Dracula" (1897), further cemented the position of the vampire as a sophisticated, cultured figure, foreshadowing future developments in cinematic and literary representations. The iconic character of Count Dracula became a template for the countless reinterpretations of the vampire myth we see today.

In contemporary media, the vampire has evolved into a more complex figure, with a plethora of characterizations emerging, representing coping with immortality, isolation, and desires. The "Twilight Saga" romanticized the vampire-human relationship, while "Interview with the Vampire" by Anne Rice explored the psychological and philosophical implications of immortality.

In summary, the archetypal portrayal of the vampire figure has a deep and rich history influenced by ancient mythologies, religious beliefs, cultural exchange, and societal fears. Its roots in preternatural origins laid the groundwork for the merging of various cultural influences to create an archetype that evokes a mixture of fear and fascination. The complexities of the vampire's portrayal in literature and cinema allow us to delve deeper into our own psychological makeup, giving us a safe space to confront our fears, desires, and the human condition.
