## The Practice of Godform Assumption

Introduction

Godform Assumption is a powerful occult practice that enables a practitioner to embody the energies, qualities, and consciousness of a deity or mythological archetype. This esoteric technique has been used throughout history by ancient priests, shamans, and modern occultists to deepen their spiritual connection, gain wisdom, and enhance their magical workings. In this lesson, we will explore the concept of Godform Assumption, its purpose and history, preparatory steps to the practice, practical methods, and exercises for assuming a Godform. We will also discuss cautions, benefits, and common misconceptions to help initiates on their enlightening journey.

### I. Purpose and History of Godform Assumption

The primary purpose of Godform Assumption is to attune one's consciousness with the deity or mythological archetype's divine essence, allowing individuals to embody their energy, learn from their wisdom, and utilize their power in magical rituals. Throughout history, it has played a significant role in various esoteric traditions, including ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Hindu mysticism.

In ancient Egypt, priests would perform rituals of Godform Assumption to channel the powers of the deities like Isis, Osiris, and Horus, to heal, manifest, and protect their communities. Similarly, in Greek and Roman traditions, Pythagorean and Platonic philosophers practiced theurgy that aimed to ascend to divine realms by assuming Godforms and engaging in conversations with celestial beings. In Hindu tradition, the practice manifests as deity yoga, whereby the practitioner visualizes and identifies themselves with a chosen deity to develop desirable qualities and achieve spiritual liberation.

### II. Preparatory Steps before Attempting Godform Assumption

Before engaging in the practice of Godform Assumption, initiates should focus on the following preparatory steps:

1. **Research and Study**: Thoroughly research and study the mythology, symbols, attributes, and historical context of the deity or archetype you wish to assume.

2. **Meditation**: Develop a daily meditation practice to enhance focus, concentration, and mental clarity required for the intense visualization involved in Godform Assumption.

3. **Setting Intentions**: Clearly define your purpose for assuming a Godform. This could be for spiritual growth, expanding consciousness, invoking specific traits or powers, or deepening empathetic understanding.

4. **Create a Sacred Space**: Establish a clean and peaceful area for your practice, with an altar dedicated to the chosen deity, adorned with symbols, incense, candles, and offerings.

### III. Practical Methods and Exercises for Assuming a Godform

1. **Relaxation and Centering**: Begin by grounding yourself through deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation to enhance focus and release tension.

2. **Invocation**: Call upon the deity or archetype through prayer, chant, or mantra, requesting their guidance, wisdom, and influence.

3. **Visualization**: Visualize the chosen deity or mythological figure in vivid detail, focusing on their physical attributes, clothing, symbols, and surrounding environment.

4. **Identification**: Merge your consciousness with the deity by imagining yourself step into their form and adopt their posture, facial expressions, and energy.

5. **Embodying Qualities**: Focus on the qualities and powers associated with the deity and feel those energies flowing through your body and mind.

6. **Maintaining Connection**: Remain in this state of Godform Assumption for a desired period, contemplating the deity's wisdom, engaging in magical workings, or meditating on specific teachings.

7. **Releasing the Form**: When ready, disconnect from the deity or archetype by stepping out of their form, thanking them for their presence, and grounding yourself through deep breathing and physical movements.

### IV. Cautions, Benefits, and Common Misconceptions

As with any esoteric practice, there are precautions, benefits, and misconceptions related to Godform Assumption.

**Cautions**: 

1. Beginners should start with benevolent, easily accessible deities or archetypes before attempting potent, complex entities to ensure a safe and balanced practice.

2. Always approach Godform Assumption with deep respect and reverence, as misusing this practice for manipulative or malicious purposes can have negative consequences.

**Benefits**:

1. Spiritual growth through connecting with divine wisdom and energies.
2. Expansion of consciousness and heightened self-awareness.
3. Development of desirable traits and empowerment through integration of the deity's qualities and powers.

Common Misconceptions:

1. Godform Assumption should not be confused with possession, as the practitioner retains control over their will and consciousness during the practice.
2. The transformative nature of this practice does not mean becoming the deity, but attuning to their energy and qualities for personal growth and spiritual development.

Conclusion

Godform Assumption is an invigorating occult practice that can deepen spiritual connection, enhance magical workings, and inspire personal growth. By understanding its history, purpose, and proper techniques, initiates can meaningfully engage with divine energies and wisdom to attain profound spiritual insights. Dedication, preparation, and respect for the practice are essential for a successful and enlightening journey.
