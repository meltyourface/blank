  In order to analyze the relationship between Godform Assumption and the development of personal gnosis within the context of the four primary elements and their corresponding archangels, we must first establish the foundational understanding of these concepts individually. This analysis will subsequently examine each component's role in shaping one's consciousness through ritual practice.
  
  1. **Primary elements and corresponding archangels in ceremonial magic**:
  
  The four primary elements within ceremonial magic are Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. Each element represents specific qualities and forces in the universe, as well as the magician's psyche. **The corresponding archangels are as follows**:
  
  - Fire: Michael (associated with protection, courage, and willpower)
  - Water: Gabriel (associated with emotions, intuition, and healing)
  - Air: Raphael (associated with communication, knowledge, and mental agility)
  - Earth: Uriel (associated with stability, material matters, and discipline)
  
  In ceremonial magic, practitioners believe in establishing a balanced connection with these elemental forces and archangels to attain greater control over themselves and their surroundings.
  
  2. **Godform Assumption and Personal Gnosis**:
  
  Godform Assumption involves the deliberate invocation and identification with a deity or divine archetype within the magician's consciousness. By invoking these forms, practitioners seek to elevate their awareness and access attributes, knowledge, and power beyond their limited human perspective. During Godform Assumption, the practitioner essentially becomes one with the deity/archetype, allowing for increased spiritual understanding â€“ which is the personal gnosis being sought.
  
  3. **The relationship between Godform Assumption and the elements/archangels**:
  
  To better comprehend the links between Godform Assumption, the elements, and the archangels, we must analyze how a practitioner approaches these aspects during invocation and evocation, as well as their effects on the consciousness.
  
  a. **Fire/Michael**: When invoking Michael and the elemental qualities of Fire, a practitioner adopts the qualities of courage, strength, and determination. Integrating these attributes widens their understanding of themselves and the world around them (gnosis) and can help attain a more refined and powerful state of awareness (ascended consciousness).
  
  b. **Water/Gabriel**: Invoking Gabriel and the elemental properties of Water brings forth emotional intelligence, allowing the practitioner to navigate the depths of their feelings, as well as provide intuitive insights. This form of personal gnosis connects with others and the universe on a more profound level, enhancing consciousness.
  
  c. **Air/Raphael**: When Raphael and the element of Air are evoked, practitioners gain access to enhanced intellectual understanding, analytical thinking, and communication skills. These attributes further personal gnosis and refine decision-making abilities, leading to a heightened state of consciousness.
  
  d. **Earth/Uriel**: Invoking Uriel and the element of Earth imparts discipline, structure, and groundedness to the practitioner. With an increased sense of stability, the individual expands their personal gnosis and forms a solid foundation to achieve a balanced, ascended consciousness.
  
  In summary, the relationship between Godform Assumption, the four primary elements, and their corresponding archangels in ceremonial magic revolves around invoking and evoking deities or archetypes infused with the qualities of these elements to ultimately attain personal gnosis and ascended consciousness. Each element and archangel offers its unique attributes to the practitioner, nurturing a balanced and powerful self-awareness and spiritual enlightenment. As the Godform Assumption process facilitates the intertwining of these aspects, the practitioner obtains the ultimate goal of self-knowledge and elevated consciousness.
