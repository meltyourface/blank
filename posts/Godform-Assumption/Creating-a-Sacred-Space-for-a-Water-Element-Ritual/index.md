To construct a sacred space or temple arrangement specifically designed for a Godform Assumption ritual involving the element of Water, we will first start by defining the key aspects of the space and ensure that it is cleansed and consecrated for the purpose of the ritual. **The following steps outline the process of creating this sacred space**:

1. **Location**: Choose a location near a natural body of water such as a river, lake, or ocean if possible. This not only provides a strong connection to the water element, but also adds to the atmosphere of the ritual. If an outdoor location near a body of water is not possible, ensure that your chosen indoor space is clean and has a tranquil atmosphere.

2. **Elemental associations**: The deities or entities associated with the water element should be included in your temple arrangement. Examples include the Greek god Poseidon, the Hindu goddess Ganga, and the Yoruba deity Yemaya. Place representations of these deities or entities on the western side of the altar, symbolizing the element of Water.

3. **Astrological correspondences**: Incorporate symbols of astrological signs and planetary influences related to the water element. The astrological water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. The ruling planets of these signs, the Moon (Cancer), Mars (traditional ruler of Scorpio), and Neptune (ruler of Pisces), can also be incorporated into the ritual as symbols or tools.

4. **Esoteric tools**: Use tools that symbolize the element of Water, such as a chalice, a cauldron, or a bowl filled with water. Additionally, include other objects that are related to water, such as seashells, driftwood, or stones collected from a nearby river or beach. Place these tools on the altar to enhance the Water element connection during the ritual.

5. **Elemental symbols**: Decorate the space with symbols related to the water element. This may include the alchemical symbol for Water or the glyph for the astrological water signs. Use colors associated with the water element, such as blues, greens, and silvers, for fabrics, altar cloths, or candles.

6. **Invocations and chants**: Prepare relevant invocations or chants to help create a rich atmosphere that facilitates a deeper connection with the Water element during the ritual. **Here is an example of an invocation to the element of Water**:

“Element of Water, flowing and changeable,
In torrents and stillness, in depths and shallows;
We invite you here to join our sacred space,
To enhance our connection and deepen our wisdom.
Poseidon, ruler of the seas,
Ganga, purifier of sins,
Yemaya, mother of the ocean and life,
Lend your power to our working and be present in our rite.”

7. **Ritual**: Perform the Godform Assumption ritual by assuming the attributes and characteristics of the water deities or entities invoked during the ceremony. Visualize yourself embodying their qualities, such as fluidity, emotional depth, and intuition, as you conduct the ritual and carry out the tasks given, incorporating the esoteric tools, symbols, and invocations prepared in the previous steps.

By following these steps, you can create a sacred space or temple arrangement specifically designed for a Godform Assumption ritual involving the element of Water, allowing for a deep connection with the watery aspect of the divine as well as enhancing your mastery of this elemental domain.
