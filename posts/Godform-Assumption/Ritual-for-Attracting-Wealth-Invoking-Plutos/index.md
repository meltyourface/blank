## The Ritual of Plutonian Abundance

**Godform**: Plutos, the God of Wealth (Greek Pantheon - a wealth-giving aspect of Hades)

**Objective**: To attract abundance and wealth through the invocation of the godform Plutos, and the manipulation of esoteric energies and occult correspondences.

Preparatory Measures:

1. **Purification**: Perform a ritual bath with water infused with herbs such as basil, mint, and chamomile symbolizing wealth and prosperity. Meditate on your intentions and visualize a golden aura of abundance surrounding you.

2. **Consecrate your ritual space**: Cleanse the area with sage or incense, and create a sacred circle using salt or chalk. Set up an altar in the direction of the North, representing the element of Earth and the manifestation of wealth.

3. **Required Mental State**: Focus on your intention to manifest abundance through the invocation of Plutos. Adopt an attitude of gratitude for the blessings you currently have and for the wealth you are about to receive.

Ceremonial Attire:

1. Don a robe or clothing in the colors of gold, green, or purple, symbolizing wealth and prosperity.

2. Wear jewelry or talismans embedded with stones such as citrine, emerald, and amethyst to amplify the energies of abundance and success.

Step-by-step Ritual Process:

1. Choose the optimal planetary hour, ideally on a Thursday or Sunday, during the waxing moon phase to harness expansive energies.

2. Light gold or green candles on your altar to invoke the godform Plutos, and burn incense of frankincense and myrrh.

3. Create a sigil or talisman representing wealth, success, and your connection to Plutos. This may include symbols of abundance like the cornucopia or a money bag, and a unique emblem infused with your intention.

4. Place the sigil or talisman upon the altar, along with offerings of gold coins, honey, or pomegranate seeds as tokens of gratitude and devotion.

5. Invoke the godform Plutos using a self-created chant or mantra. **For example**: "Mighty Plutos, god of wealth and abundance, I call upon thee. Grant me the power of your prosperous energies, bless me with success and fortune. As I speak, so mote it be."

6. Close your eyes and visualize the godform Plutos materializing before you, bestowing his infinite riches upon you and filling your aura with golden light.

7. Through the talisman or sigil, focus your energies on manifesting wealth and abundance in your life. Hold this intention firmly in your mind, allowing it to permeate the universe and create the desired outcome.

8. Express gratitude to Plutos for his presence and gifts, then release his energy by saying, "Mighty Plutos, thank you for your blessings. I release your godform, knowing that your abundance flows into my life now."

9. Extinguish the candles and incense, and leave the offerings on the altar to honor the godform and anchor the ritual's intentions.

10. Carry the sigil or talisman with you and meditate upon it daily, as a reminder of your connection to Plutos and your intention to manifest wealth and abundance.

Through the mastery of the Godform Assumption and commitment to this meticulously designed ritual, harness the power of Plutos to attract wealth and abundance into your life. Remember to stay true to your intentions and express gratitude for the blessings you receive.
