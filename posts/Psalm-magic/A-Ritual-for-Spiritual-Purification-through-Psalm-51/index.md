## The Ceremony of Auric Purification through Psalm 51

Materials Needed:
1. A clean, private space for the ceremony
2. A copy of Psalm 51
3. A white or purple candle (representing purification and spiritual connection)
4. A small bowl of water (representing cleansing)
5. An incense of frankincense or myrrh (representing spiritual elevation)
6. A small bell or chime (representing sound vibrations)
7. A circular cloth or rug in the color indigo or violet (representing the spiritual frequencies of the aura)
8. A mirror (representing self-reflection)
**Step 1**: Preparation 
Arrange the circular cloth or rug in the center of the clean private space, representing the individual's aura. Position the mirror on one side of the cloth or rug, signifying the need for self-reflection within this purifying process. Place the white or purple candle in the center of the cloth or rug, symbolizing purity and spiritual connection, with the incense and the bowl of water next to it. The small bell or chime should be placed nearby, ready to be used at key moments in the ceremony.
**Step 2**: Invoking Protection and Cleansing
The individual should begin by standing at the edge of the cloth or rug facing the mirror and reciting verse 11 from Psalm 51, "Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me." This verse invokes divine protection and guidance as well as recognizes the sanctity of the process about to be undertaken.
**Step 3**: Psychic Cleansing
The individual should light the candle and incense, allowing the uplifting scent to permeate the air. Next, the individual should dip their fingers in the bowl of water and anoint their forehead and throat (third eye and throat chakras) while reciting verse 7 from Psalm 51, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." The water symbolizes cleansing, and the verse aligns with the intention of purifying the aura.
**Step 4**: Sound Vibrations and Energy Alignment
Following the anointment, the individual should gently strike the bell or chime three times, aligning with the sacred rhythm of verse 8 from Psalm 51, "Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice." The vibrations produced by the bell resonate with the auric field, attuning it to higher frequencies and promoting a state of balance and harmony.
**Step 5**: Invoking Renewal and Spiritual Purity
As the final step in the ceremony, the individual should stand in the center of the cloth, with both hands uplifted, and recite verse 10 of Psalm 51, "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me." This powerful verse serves as both invocation and affirmation of the individual's renewed sense of spiritual purity and balance.
**Step 6**: Closing the Ceremony
Allow the candle and incense to burn out naturally, signaling the completion of the ritual. The individual should take some time to meditate and reflect on the profound energies that have been invoked during the ceremony. The newly cleansed and balanced aura will emanate positive energy, introducing a newfound sense of peace, purity, and spiritual empowerment to their daily life.
