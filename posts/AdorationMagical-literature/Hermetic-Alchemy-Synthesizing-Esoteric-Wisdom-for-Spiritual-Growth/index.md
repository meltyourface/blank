Answering this knowledge challenge requires a comprehensive understanding of the core principles of Hermeticism, the symbolism in the Tarot, and the practice of Theurgy. By synthesizing these components, one can then approach decoding the hidden message contained within a revered alchemical text.

To begin, let us first briefly look at each concept.

**Hermeticism**
Hermeticism is an esoteric, philosophical, and spiritual tradition based on the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure believed to be a fusion of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. The core teachings of Hermeticism revolve around the following principles:
1. Mentalism: Everything in existence is a creation of the mind
2. Correspondence: As above, so below; as within, so without
3. Vibration: All matter and energy in the universe vibrate at different frequencies
4. Polarity: Everything contains polar opposites
5. Rhythm: All phenomena in existence move through cycles
6. Cause and Effect: All events have a cause and effect relationship
7. Gender: Masculine and feminine energies exist in all things

**Tarot**
The Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, divided into the Major Arcana (22 cards) and the Minor Arcana (56 cards). The cards hold deep symbolism related to various aspects of life, spirituality, and personal growth. They are often seen as a tool for personal introspection and divination. The imagery of the Tarot is believed to represent universal archetypes and underlying forces that shape the human experience.

**Theurgy**
Theurgy is a set of spiritual practices aimed at aligning oneself with divine energies and beings, with the ultimate goal of attaining spiritual ascent, self-realization, and enlightenment. These practices often include rituals, prayers, meditation, and other forms of magical practices that invoke the presence of higher beings or spiritual forces.

Now, we must synthesize these concepts to decode the hidden message concealed within an alchemical text.

**Integration and Synthesis**
Hermetic principles provide a philosophical foundation for understanding the universe's inner workings. Thus, they can serve as a framework for interpreting the rich symbolism of the Tarot and give meaning to Theurgical practices. The following steps outline the process of decoding the hidden message:

1. Identify specific correlations between the Hermetic principles and Tarot symbolism:
By examining the Major Arcana cards, we can find several correspondences between Hermetic teachings and the symbols depicted on the cards:

- The Magician: Mentalism, as it represents the ability to create one's reality through the power of the mind
- The High Priestess: Polarity and Gender, representing the balance between masculine and feminine energies
- The Wheel of Fortune: Rhythm and Cause and Effect, symbolizing the cyclical nature of events in life and their interconnected relationships

2. Connect these correlations to Theurgical practices:
Once the correlations are established, we can link them to Theurgy and its underlying aim to align oneself with higher powers.

- The Magician and Mentalism: By invoking the Hermetic principle of Mentalism, practitioners of Theurgy can potentially harness the creative power of their minds to manifest their intentions and align themselves with the divine.
  
- The High Priestess and Polarity/Gender: Integrating these principles into Theurgical rites may involve balancing one's energies (i.e., masculine and feminine) to create harmony and facilitate communion with the divine.

- The Wheel of Fortune and Rhythm/Cause and Effect: Understanding these principles can aid Theurgists in recognizing patterns and cycles in their spiritual journey, enabling them to better discern the influences of past actions and navigate future decisions.

3. Decode the hidden message within the alchemical text:
With a comprehensive understanding of the connections between these concepts, we can now attempt to decode the esoteric message concealed within an alchemical text. To do so, we must:

- Examine the alchemical text itself, looking for any references to Hermetic principles, Tarot symbolism, and Theurgical practices.
- Analyze the context of these references and how they relate to one another.
- Interpret the overall message and meaning implied by these connections, looking for any guidance or insights they may reveal about the spiritual path.

In conclusion, the synthesis of Hermeticism, Tarot symbolism, and Theurgical practices can lead to a deeper understanding of esoteric wisdom and provide valuable insights into the spiritual journey. By recognizing the interplay between these principles, one is better equipped to decode the hidden messages contained within revered alchemical texts and unlock the secrets of their inner transformations.
