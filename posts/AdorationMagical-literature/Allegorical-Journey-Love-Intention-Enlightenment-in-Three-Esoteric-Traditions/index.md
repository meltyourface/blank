Answer: 

Upon careful evaluation of various mystical and esoteric traditions, we can create an allegory that weaves together symbols, numerical values, and textual references from the following three spiritual disciplines: The Hermetic Qabalah, the alchemical theory, and the Tarot. The amalgamation of these distinct teachings will illuminate the transformative powers of love, intention, and enlightenment in our path to spiritual growth.

The Allegory:
A pilgrim (The Fool in Tarot) embarks on a journey to discover the secrets of the Universe. He comes across an ancient temple with three doors (Numerical symbolism), each representing a unique aspect of his spiritual quest.

Door 1: The Tree of Life (Hermetic Qabalah)
The first door portrays the Qabalistic Tree of Life, where ten sephiroth (numerical value) represent different aspects of God and the Universe. The pilgrim discovers that love (symbolized by Chesed) flows through these interconnected spheres of knowledge.

Door 2: The Magnum Opus (Alchemical Theory)
The second door illustrates the Magnum Opus, the great work of alchemists, depicting four stages of transformation: Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, and Rubedo (numerical value). Their goal is to transmute base metals into gold and enact personal spiritual transformation. Through the purifying process of alchemical transformation, one learns the power of intention in manifesting spiritual evolution.

Door 3: The Luminaries (Tarot)
The third door showcases two luminaries: The Sun and The Moon (Textual references). The allegory borrows from the Tarot's Major Arcana, the 19th card - The Sun, symbolizing enlightenment and abundance, and the 18th card - The Moon, representing illusion, intuition, and the subconscious mind.

Decoding the Allegory:
As the pilgrim comprehends the interconnectedness of the symbols and their complex relationship, he acquires a deeper understanding of the spiritual lesson hidden within the allegory. The key takeaway lies in the realization that the Universe's essence is based on love (Chesed-Door 1), which can be experienced and cultivated through focused intention (Magnum Opus-Door 2) and awareness of intuitive knowledge (Luminaries-Door 3). This process ultimately lights the path to enlightenment.

**Conclusion**:
This allegorical riddle, derived from three different esoteric traditions – the Hermetic Qabalah, alchemical theory, and Tarot – symbolically conveys the profound spiritual lesson about the power of love, intention, and enlightenment. When decoded, the allegory teaches the initiate about the transformative energy of love and intention in obtaining wisdom and spiritual growth, fostering a path towards enlightenment.
