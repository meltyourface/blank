Imbolg Incense Recipe:

**Ingredients**:
1. 2 parts dried basil leaves
2. 2 parts dried rosemary leaves
3. 1 part dried angelica root
4. 1 part dried bay leaves
5. 1 part dried juniper berries
6. 1 part dried myrrh resin
7. Â½ part dried acacia flowers
8. 10 drops frankincense essential oil
9. 10 drops lavender essential oil
10. 5 drops sandalwood essential oil
11. 5 drops cedarwood essential oil
12. Small sunstone or clear quartz crystal chips (optional)

**Instructions**:

1. Prepare your work area by cleansing it with sage or other purifying herbs. Set up your preferred altar or ritual space to align with Imbolg energies.

2. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the dried basil and rosemary leaves until they become a fine powder.

3. Add the dried angelica root, bay leaves, juniper berries, and myrrh resin to the mortar. Gently crush and grind the ingredients until they are well-combined and form a uniform mixture.

4. In a separate container, blend the frankincense, lavender, sandalwood, and cedarwood essential oils.

5. Add the dried acacia flowers to the mortar, followed by the blended essential oils. Gently mix the ingredients together to incorporate the oils evenly.

6. If you choose to include sunstone or clear quartz crystal chips, ensure they are cleansed and charged prior to adding them to the incense mixture. Gently fold the chips into the mixture.

7. Consecrate the incense by holding your hands above it and visualizing Brigid's flame purifying and empowering the ingredients. Recite an invocation or prayer to imbue the blend with your intentions.

8. Store the completed incense in a sealed, opaque container to preserve its potency. Label it with the name "Imbolg Incense," ingredients, and creation date.

Using the Incense in Imbolg Rituals:

1. Light a charcoal disc according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place the disc in a heat-proof incense burner or on a layer of sand.

2. Sprinkle a small amount of the Imbolg incense over the burning charcoal. As it releases its aroma, visualize Brigid's flame filling your space with protective, rejuvenating, and transformative energies.

3. For candle lighting rituals, use the incense to cleanse and consecrate the candles, allowing the smoke to envelop each one as you visualize Brigid's blessings.

4. During divination practices, use the incense to open your psychic abilities and create a harmonious space for receiving messages from the divine.

5. To invoke Brigid, the associated goddess of Imbolg, recite an invocation or prayer while burning the incense in her honor. Feel her nurturing and inspiring presence with each breath you take.

Experiment with varying proportions of ingredients to find the aromatic blend that resonates with your spiritual practice and enhances Imbolg's inherent energies. Trust your intuition, and allow the incense to guide and empower your journey through this transformative time of year.
