In addressing this knowledge challenge, we must create a complex ritual deeply rooted in the teachings of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, a 15th-century grimoire. This ritual will help enable a practitioner to achieve self-discovery, master the four elements, and align oneself with their Holy Guardian Angel, while understanding the interconnected nature of these concepts and addressing potential pitfalls such as adhering to the 18-month timeline and managing inherent risks.

Firstly, let's outline the key aspects of the Abramelin ritual as a foundation for our complex ritual:

1. The stage of purification and moral improvement (six to twelve months)
2. The invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel (six months)
3. Binding the four elemental kings and acquiring magical powers (two months)

Structured accordingly, our complex ritual will consist of three main stages, which we will develop and consider both individually and within the context of the Abramelin tradition:

Stage 1: Purification and Self-Discovery
-------------------------------------------

This stage is essential in the Abramelin teachings, with a focus on purifying the mind, body, and spirit. The practitioner will begin by abstaining from lowly desires and activities and concentrating on righteous and compassionate actions. This purification process can be divided into three sub-stages:

1.1. Purification of the body: Practitioners will maintain cleanliness and adhere to a strict diet, avoiding meat and alcohol, restricting intake to whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
1.2. Purification of the mind: Practitioners will employ meditation techniques to clear the mind of negative thoughts, focusing on awareness, mindfulness, and gratitude for life's blessings.
1.3. Purification of the spirit: Practitioners will participate in regular prayers, engage in discussions with philosophical and spiritual teachers, and perform charity work.

Stage 2: Elemental Mastery
-----------------------------

Aligned with classical elemental theory, mastering the four elements of earth, air, water, and fire is essential in exerting one's will over the physical and spiritual realms. In this second stage, practitioners will immerse themselves in the symbology, qualities, and correspondences of each element, undertaking the following for each:

2.1. Elemental meditations: Daily, hour-long meditations on each element, focusing on their correspondences (e.g., north/earth, east/air, south/fire, west/water).
2.2. Elemental rituals: Weekly rituals to attune oneself to the energies of each element, aiming to balance and harmonize their presence in one's life.
2.3. Elemental magic: Perform simple practical exercises on each element, such as candle magic, clay work, aerokinesis, and water rituals, to develop a deep connection to each.

Stage 3: Aligning with the Holy Guardian Angel
-----------------------------------------------

The ultimate goal of the Abramelin tradition is achieving Knowledge and Conversation with one's Holy Guardian Angel, which involves the following steps:

3.1. Building the Holy Chamber: Create a sacred space, maintaining a consistent prayer routine, wearing white clothes, and burning incense that corresponds to the aspect of the divine under which the Angel operates.
3.2. Invoking the Holy Guardian Angel: Over six months, perform daily invocations and prayers, maintaining a state of constant readiness for contact with the Angel.
3.3. Binding the Elemental Kings: Once contact with the Angel has been established, the practitioner engages in a series of rituals to bind the four elemental kings, allowing mastery over their respective realms of influence.

Addressing Potential Pitfalls
-------------------------------

As we design this complex ritual, it's nigh-essential that we take precautions to avoid potential risks and address its inherent demands:

1. Managing the 18-month timeline: Practitioners should keep a detailed journal to record progress, discoveries, and setbacks. Flexible yet structured daily routines will enable a smooth flow through the stages and help ensure the completion of the process within the given timeframe.
2. Balancing daily life with spiritual practice: Allocating scheduled blocks for personal and work commitments during the day ensures that the practitioner's life remains balanced and minimizes chances of burnout.
3. Utilizing a support system: Establishing a network of other practitioners undertaking the ritual can prove invaluable in sharing experiences, seeking guidance, and encouraging perseverance throughout the process.

In summary, our complex ritual involves three key stages: purification and self-discovery, mastery over the four elements, and alignment with one's Holy Guardian Angel. By being attentive to potential pitfalls such as adhering to the 18-month timeline and maintaining a balanced, structured approach towards all aspects of the ritual, the practitioner can remain steadfast in their pursuit of the ultimate goal, navigating the interconnectivity of these concepts and maximizing the transformative potential of the journey.
