Answer: Establishing contact with one's Holy Guardian Angel

Explanation: In the context of the occult and esoteric practices, Abramelin's magical system is primarily focused on establishing contact with one's Holy Guardian Angel (HGA). This angelic being is believed to be a guiding force in a person's life, and the magician's central goal in this system is to unite their own consciousness with that of their HGA, therefore achieving a state of deep self-knowledge and spiritual insight.

The system is derived from the Book of Abramelin, a grimoire that is attributed to the Jewish Kabbalist and magician Abramelin the Mage, dating back to the 15th century. The book consists of a series of teachings, written in the form of a correspondence between Abramelin and his student, detailing the necessary steps to achieve spiritual enlightenment through the union with one's Holy Guardian Angel.

This process requires the practitioner to follow a strict system of ritual, lifestyle, meditative, and magical operations. These include purifying oneself through invocations, prayer, and the strict observance of dietary restrictions along with other environmental factors. The operations typically culminate in a final ritual known as the "Sacrament of the Holy Guardian Angel," in which the magician hopes to achieve union with their HGA.

Creating a golem from clay, summoning spirits using a pentagram, and remote viewing through astral projection are all elements of occult practices, but they are not central to the Abramelin system and its focus on connecting with the Holy Guardian Angel. While certain systems like the Kabbalah may include aspects of creating golems or ritual summoning, it is important to discern that these practices are separate from the central goals of the Abramelin magical system.

In conclusion, understanding and practicing the Abramelin system requires a deep understanding of various spiritual and esoteric practices, but its ultimate goal is firmly rooted in the pursuit of establishing contact with one's Holy Guardian Angel. Other practices, while undeniably relevant to the broader world of the occult, may not have direct bearing on the success of this endeavor.
