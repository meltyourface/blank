  To create this powerful sigil, we will follow a specific set of steps that involve understanding the symbolism and energies of the rowan tree and daisy, meditating on their combined properties, and incorporating traditional symbolism and geometric shapes into the design.
  
  Step 1: Gathering materials
  Acquire a parchment or a high-quality piece of paper, a pen with ink made from rowan berries, and petals from freshly harvested daisies.
  
  Step 2: Cleansing and preparation
  Cleanse and consecrate the pen, ink, and paper using a smudge stick made from dried rowan leaves and daisy petals. This step is important to purify the materials and create sacred space for working with the higher energies involved.
  
  Step 3: Understanding the symbolism
  Meditate on the protective energies of the rowan tree and the daisies. **Familiarize yourself with the corresponding traditional symbols**:
  
  - Rowan tree: Rune "Luis" (ᚂ), symbolizes protection and strength.
  - Daisy: A simple flower shape with a round center, representing purity and innocence.
  
  Step 4: Creating the sigil
  Draw the rune "Luis" in the center of the parchment, this will act as the base of our sigil. Encircle it with the flower shape of the daisy to combine both symbols into a unified design. 
  
  Step 5: Integrate geometrical shapes
  Incorporate the following geometric shapes to strengthen the connection to the energies of the plants and enhance the potency of the sigil:
  - Draw an upright pentagram, starting from the top point, within the daisy's circle to represent protection and banishing of negative energies.
  - Draw a circle around the entire sigil to establish a boundary between the spiritual and physical realms.
  
  Step 6: Charging the sigil
  This charging step will be done during the most auspicious planetary alignment for protection – when Mars is in Aries, the moon is waning, and the sun is conjunct Jupiter.
  
  Light a white candle, representative of purity and protective energies, and place it near the sigil. Close your eyes, focus on your intention to ward off malevolent forces and keep the Dark Prince at bay, while connecting to the energies of the rowan tree and daisies.
  
  Repeat the following invocation three times while visualizing the sigil glowing with a bright, divine light:
  
  "By the sacred power of the rowan tree and the purity of daisies, combined,
  I call upon the forces of protection to bind and empower this sigil divine.
  In the name of the highest spiritual light, I create this talisman to ward off the malevolent and keep the Dark Prince at bay.
  As I will it, so mote it be."
  
  Step 7: Activation and use
  Once charged, the sigil is ready for activation and use. Place the parchment in an amulet or carry it with you. You may also draw the sigil with the rowan berry ink on a doorway, window frame, or any other surface to protect your home or sacred space from negative forces.
