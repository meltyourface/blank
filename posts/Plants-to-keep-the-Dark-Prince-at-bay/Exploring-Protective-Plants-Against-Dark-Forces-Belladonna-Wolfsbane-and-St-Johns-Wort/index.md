To address this knowledge challenge, we must first examine the properties of Belladonna, Wolfsbane, and St. John's Wort, as well as their historical, mythological, and esoteric contexts. Then, we can delve into the practical and symbolic applications of these plants in warding off the influences of the Dark Prince.

1. **Belladonna (Atropa belladonna)**:
Belladonna, also known as Deadly Nightshade, is a highly toxic plant native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. Belladonna contains the alkaloid atropine, which can cause hallucinations, convulsions, and even death when ingested in sufficient quantities. In addition to its pharmaceutical uses, Belladonna has a long history in witchcraft, where it was used in ointments and potions to induce visions, astral travel, and shape-shifting. 

Symbolic associations of Belladonna:
Belladonna is associated with the goddesses of the Underworld, such as Hecate and Persephone, who are said to protect the souls of the deceased and guide them to the afterlife. In this sense, Belladonna symbolizes the veil between the worlds, connecting the living and the dead, and allowing for transgression between those realms.

Practical applications of Belladonna:
Given its association with underworld goddesses and its hallucinogenic properties, Belladonna can be employed in rituals to ward off malevolent spirits and entities, including the Dark Prince. However, its toxic nature and the risks associated with its use require caution and expertise from the practitioner.

2. **Wolfsbane (Aconitum napellus)**:
Wolfsbane, or Monkshood, is another highly toxic plant found throughout Europe and Asia. It contains alkaloids, such as aconitine, that can cause muscle paralysis and heart failure if ingested. Wolfsbane has been used historically in poisonings, assassinations, and even as a means to kill wolves, hence the name.

Symbolic associations of Wolfsbane:
In Greek mythology, Wolfsbane is associated with Hecate, who is considered the queen of witches. The plant is also linked to the myth of Medea, who attempts to poison Theseus using a crown imbued with the potent toxins of Wolfsbane. Thus, the plant is connected to dark and even treacherous magical workings.

Practical applications of Wolfsbane:
As an apotropaic (evil-averting) plant, Wolfsbane may be used in warding rituals to protect from the influences of the Dark Prince. It is also utilized as a powerful binding agent in spells aimed at restraining malevolent beings or energies. However, like Belladonna, working with Wolfsbane requires caution and expertise due to its highly toxic nature.

3. St. **John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum)**:
In stark contrast to the previous plants, St. John's Wort is a non-toxic, sun-loving plant with bright yellow flowers. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat depression, nerve pain, and inflammation.

Symbolic associations of St. **John's Wort**:
St. John's Wort is closely associated with the Christian feast day of St. John the Baptist, which occurs around the summer solstice. It is a symbol of light, protection, and healing, particularly against dark forces and malevolent influences.

Practical applications of St. **John's Wort**:
As a potent protective herb, St. John's Wort can be employed in various ways to safeguard one's surroundings from the Dark Prince's influence. It may be hung in windows, doorways, or incorporated into protective amulets. Its positive and uplifting attributes can also be used in blessings, purifications, and cleansing rituals.

In conclusion, Belladonna, Wolfsbane, and St. John's Wort offer both symbolic and practical applications against the influences of the Dark Prince. While Belladonna and Wolfsbane share some similarities in their toxic nature and association with underworld goddesses, they differ in their direct applications due to their inherent risks. St. John's Wort offers a safer, light-bearing alternative for warding off malevolent forces. When using these plants for protection, it is crucial to respect their diverse properties and to follow responsible practices, ensuring the safety and efficacy of their use.
