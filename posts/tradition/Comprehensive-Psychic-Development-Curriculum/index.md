description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, tradition, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design an in-depth curriculum focused on the cultivation and enhancement of psychic abilities within the context of esoteric and occult disciplines. The program should include specific exercises, techniques, and resources pertinent to various psychic skills such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and psychometry. Incorporate a progressive module structure that interweaves the theoretical underpinnings of these abilities with experiential learning opportunities, while also factoring in the role of ritualistic practices and the influence of historical occult figures. Additionally, devise methods for assessing the development and proficiency of participants' psychic aptitudes throughout the course.
