The ritual instrument devised for the intricate ceremonial practices of the Islamic cult of Saturn shall be called "As-Sa'at Al-Kubra," or "The Great Hourglass." This instrument will embody the symbolic significance of time, cycles, and change, all of which are central qualities to Saturn. In the Islamic mystic tradition, time and cycles are seen as reflections of the cosmic forces and as tools to guide us through the spiritual transformation.

As-Sa'at Al-Kubra consists of an hourglass made of high-quality brass, with a series of sacred geometric patterns and Islamic calligraphy etched onto the surface of the brass. The upper part of the hourglass contains the "Asma Ul-Husna," or the 99 beautiful names of Allah, while the lower part bears reference to the "Asma Al-Qamar," or the planetary names of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In the center of the hourglass, the "Seal of Saturn" is adorned with other associated esoteric symbols, and the sand within the chamber is black, signifying the shadow aspects of the human psyche.

The hourglass will be designed to complete one rotation in the exact duration of a Saturnian day, which translates to roughly 10 Earth hours and 32 Earth minutes. This intrinsic characteristic of the As-Sa'at Al-Kubra significantly aligns it with the planet's divine energy and celestial power.

During the Saturnine rituals, As-Sa'at Al-Kubra will serve several critical roles:

1. **Invocation and Consecration**:
Preparing and adhering to the prescribed ritual, practitioners will use As-Sa'at Al-Kubra to invoke the energies of Saturn, consecrating and charging the instrument. The hourglass must be placed on a representation of the sacred geometry of Saturn, creating a powerful connection between the ritual space, the practitioner, and the planet.

2. **Praises and Offerings**:
The practitioner will begin reciting praises and offering prayers to the divine aspect of Saturn, honoring its transformative and constructive power. The practitioner turns As-Sa'at Al-Kubra upside-down, setting the flow of the sand into motion while chanting 72 times the verses from the Quran for 10 Earth hours and 32 Earth minutes. This continuous cycle represents the attributes of darkness and light, material and spiritual realms, and aligns the practitioner's intention with the essence of Saturn.

3. **Rite of Passage**:
During the ritual, the practitioner will utilize As-Sa'at Al-Kubra to symbolize the passage of time and mastery over time's cyclic nature. The intricately designed patterns etched on the metal represent cosmic order and the interconnectedness of all things in the universe.
 
4. **Manifestation and Transformation**:
As the circuit of As-Sa'at Al-Kubra concludes, the manifested energies of Saturn are drawn into the practitioner's body and soul, fostering inner transformation, spiritual growth, and transcendence. The hourglass serves as a tangible reminder of the constant flux within human experience, guiding the adept through their ongoing journey into the realm of hidden knowledge and divine wisdom.

In its multifaceted role within the ceremonial practices of the Islamic cult of Saturn, the As-Sa'at Al-Kubra will prove influential in helping the practitioners develop a deeper understanding of the cosmic powers at play, embrace the cyclical nature of time, and draw upon Saturn's enigmatic energies to foster spiritual development and growth.
