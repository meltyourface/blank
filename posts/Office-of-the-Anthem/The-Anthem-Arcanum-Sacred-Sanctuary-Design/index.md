description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Office of the Anthem, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a detailed blueprint for constructing an intricate sanctuary devoted to the study, preservation, and application of Office of the Anthem's esoteric principles. The sanctuary should incorporate symbology related to the occult and Anthem mysticism, as well as incorporate specific elements like an inner sanctum for focused meditation, a library housing ancient texts and manuscripts on the Anthem, and an altar designed for the execution of complex rituals. Additionally, consider the integration of acoustic and spatial designs to enhance the experience and efficacy of the sacred rituals performed within.
