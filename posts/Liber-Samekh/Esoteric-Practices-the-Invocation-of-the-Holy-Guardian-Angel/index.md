To investigate the transformation of consciousness experienced during the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel in Liber Samekh, we must examine the various esoteric practices that parallel the process. In this analysis, we will dissect the similarities and differences between personal, microcosmic evolution and the esoteric concepts of alchemical transmutation, kabbalistic pathworking, and tantra. Our primary goal is to establish a comprehensive understanding of the multidimensional development that takes place throughout the invocation.

First and foremost, we need to understand the overarching goal of Liber Samekh – invoking the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA). It refers to the realization and union of the individual with the higher self or the "true self," an aspect of the larger cosmic universe, both transcendent and imminent. It represents the culmination of personal spiritual development, serving as a guide and protector on the seeker's path to enlightenment.

Now, let us analyze the parallels among the specific esoteric practices and the transformation of consciousness experienced in Liber Samekh.

1. Alchemical Transmutation: Alchemy – primarily associated with the transformation of base metals into gold – represents a spiritual process that aims to purify the soul and awaken higher states of consciousness. Similar to the invocation of the HGA, alchemy consists of various stages, symbolized by colors: Nigredo (black), Albedo (white), Citrinitas (yellow), and Rubedo (red). These stages mirror those experienced during the invocation of the HGA, such as purification, illumination, unification of opposites, and union with the divine.

For example, the initial stage of Nigredo represents the seeker's confrontation with the 'shadow' or unconscious aspects of the self. Similar to the early stages of invoking the HGA, this phase involves purification, realization, and integration of the individual's repressed desires and fears.

2. Kabbalistic Pathworking: Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition, offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the universe and the individual's role within it. The Tree of Life – a core symbol in Kabbalah – represents a map of consciousness and spiritual evolution. Kabbalistic pathworking involves focused meditation on the sephiroth (the 'spheres' on the Tree of Life) and the paths connecting them, with the aim of attaining higher states of consciousness and realizing one's divine nature.

Pathworking parallels the invocation of the HGA in that both practices involve traversing different levels of consciousness to reach a union with the divine. For instance, climbing the Tree of Life from the bottom sphere, Malkuth (Kingdom), to the top sphere, Kether (Crown), is akin to the gradual transformation experienced during the HGA invocation.

3. Tantra: Tantra is an esoteric spiritual practice that originated in India, concerning the human body's energy system and the interplay of cosmic polarities (Shakti and Shiva). The goal of tantra is to awaken the dormant spiritual energy (Kundalini) at the base of the spine, move it up to the crown of the head, and ultimately realize one's divine nature.

In this case, the invocation of the HGA bears similarities to the Kundalini awakening, where the seeker raises their conscious awareness by uniting the microcosmic and macrocosmic aspects of the soul.

In summary, the transformation of consciousness experienced during the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel in Liber Samekh draws parallels to the microcosmic evolution and esoteric practices of alchemical transmutation, kabbalistic pathworking, and tantra. Each practice serves as a path toward self-realization and union with the divine. The similarities and differences between these systems offer valuable insights into the underlying patterns of spiritual transformation, underscoring the multidimensional development that takes place throughout the invocation process.
