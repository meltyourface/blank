In the Heaven's Gate UFO cult, daily life was characterized by strict routines, unique rituals, and shared living arrangements. As a member of the cult, an individual would be expected to adhere to the group's beliefs and practices while preparing for the eventual arrival of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The daily activities of a member would revolve around strengthening their convictions in the cosmic significance of their mission and remaining dedicated to their leader, Marshall Applewhite, also known as "Do".

Morning Routine:
Members of the Heaven's Gate cult would wake up early, around 5 AM. They would begin their day with a shared morning meditation session, designed to align their energies and focus on their connection to higher cosmic forces. Following meditation, members would engage in light exercise and calisthenics to maintain their physical health and keep their bodies fit as "vehicles" for their souls.

Meals and Chores:
Heaven's Gate had a strict communal lifestyle, supported by daily chores and group meals. Members were assigned tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and maintenance work, all of which were expected to be completed with care and precision. Meals were typically simple and vegetarian, designed to maintain a healthy, low-calorie diet.

Study and Spiritual Development:
Throughout the day, members would spend time in group study sessions, in which they would read and discuss religious and esoteric texts, including the Bible, works on UFO phenomena, and Do's teachings. These sessions were intended to deepen their understanding of the cult's beliefs, such as the idea that Earth was due to be "recycled" and only members of Heaven's Gate would be saved by ascending to a higher plane with the help of extraterrestrial beings.

Rituals and Practices:
Heaven's Gate had its share of unique rituals and practices, which permeated daily life. One such practice was the "checking" system, where members would consult each other and gain permission before performing any task outside their usual routine. This helped maintain a sense of order and discipline within the group. Members were also expected to repress any sexual desires and maintain a celibate lifestyle, as it was believed that uncontrollable desires could hinder their spiritual ascension.

Preparations for the Extraterrestrial Arrival:
Believing that the arrival of extraterrestrial beings was imminent, Heaven's Gate members spent considerable time planning and preparing for this event. They created and researched detailed maps of celestial bodies, engaged in discussion about various means of contact with extraterrestrials, and prepared materials and supplies in the event of an evacuation or relocation.

Evening Routine and Sleep:
To ensure that their minds remained focused on their mission, evenings were spent in reflective or meditative practices. Before retiring for the night, members would often participate in group affirmations, reinforcing their dedication to Heaven's Gate and their cosmic purpose. Bedtime was fairly early, around 10 PM, to ensure that members would rise refreshed for another day of disciplined, focused, and spiritually-oriented activities.

In summary, the daily life of a Heaven's Gate member was strictly regimented, with an emphasis on communal living, spiritual development, and preparation for the arrival of extraterrestrial beings. Through rituals, study sessions, daily tasks, and a shared sense of purpose, members reinforced their convictions in the cosmic significance of their mission, even as society at large regarded their beliefs with skepticism and, ultimately, tragedy.
