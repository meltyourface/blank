1. Spread Selection:
Choose the Five-card Elemental Guidance spread from The Book of HermesTarot for comprehensive daily self-reflection. This spread consists of the following positions:
   - Fire (Card 1): Represents actions and motivations.
   - Water (Card 2): Represents emotions and intuition.
   - Air (Card 3): Represents thoughts and intellectual processes.
   - Earth (Card 4): Represents practical matters and material influences.
   - Spirit (Card 5): Represents spiritual energies and personal growth.

2. Time and Space:
Designate a specific and quiet space for your daily tarot practice, preferably facing east to welcome the morning sun. As for the time, commit to practicing at dawn, when your mind is fresh and clear, for optimal focus and connection with the cards.

3. Preparation and Cleansing Ritual:
Before each session, complete the following steps:
   - Light incense (such as rosemary or sandalwood) to purify the space.
   - Meditate for five minutes, focusing on your breath and intentions for the session.
   - Hold the tarot deck between your hands and envision a circle of protective energy surrounding you.

4. Journal Prompts:
For each card drawn in the Five-card Elemental Guidance spread, write a reflection using the following prompts:
   - Fire: How can I harness the energy of this card to fuel my actions and enhance my motivation?
   - Water: What emotions or intuitive insights are revealed by this card, and how can they guide my personal development?
   - Air: How does this card challenge my intellectual processes and prompt me to think more critically or creatively?
   - Earth: In what ways does this card highlight my material or financial circumstances, and what can I learn from it?
   - Spirit: What spiritual growth could emerge from the message of this card, and how can I apply that growth to my life?

5. Integration of Esoteric Elements:
Enhance your understanding of The Book of HermesTarot messages by incorporating astrology and numerology into your practice:
   - Know your natal astrology chart and identify any connections between the cards' astrological associations and your personal planetary placements.
   - Calculate your life path number and determine if any numerological themes emerge from the cards, especially regarding life lessons or spiritual growth.

6. Monthly Self-Reflection and Assessment Process:
At the end of each month, sit down and analyze your daily tarot sessions by answering the following questions:
   - What recurring patterns or themes have emerged from my daily tarot practice this month?
   - Have any significant shifts or breakthroughs occurred in my emotional, mental, or spiritual growth?
   - Based on my tarot readings, what areas of my life require additional inquiry or attention in the coming month?
