The Origins and Evolution of The Book of HermesTarot

Dating back to the early 14th century, the Tarot initially appeared in Europe as a form of playing cards. However, over the centuries, it has evolved into a powerful tool used for divination and esoteric wisdom. Held sacred by various mystical traditions, The Book of HermesTarot holds potent symbolism and imagery that have been refined and enriched through time. Let us trace the key milestones, influential figures, and varied customs that have shaped its intricate metamorphosis.

### I. Playing Cards: The Precursor of Tarot

The earliest known Tarot decks were created in Italy (circa 1440) as playing cards for games such as tarocchini and the French jeu de Tarot. These decks were composed of 78 cards, divided between the major (divided into 22 trump cards, called trionfi) and minor arcana (56 suit cards). The earliest decks featured suits of swords, coins, cups, and batons, akin to those in modern Tarot.

### II. Esoteric Beginnings and Early Occult Influences

Though originally designed for play, by the late 18th century, Tarot cards gained esoteric and occult associations. In 1781, Antoine Court de Gébelin – a French Freemason and writer – claimed in his work "Le Monde Primitif" that the Tarot contained hidden secrets from ancient Egypt.

Gébelin linked Tarot cards to the Egyptian deities Thoth and Isis, coining the name "The Book of Thoth" (later adopted by Aleister Crowley for his own Tarot deck). The Book of HermesTarot derives its name from the Greek equivalent of Thoth – Hermes – who is known as the father of occult wisdom and astrology.

### III. The Golden Dawn: A Turning Point in Tarot History

At the end of the 19th century, a secret society known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn emerged in England as an influential force within Western occultism. Members of the society believed in initiation, mysticism, and the study of esoteric traditions, including the Tarot.

Prominent members such as Arthur Edward Waite, Pamela Colman Smith, and Aleister Crowley developed the iconic Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot deck, Thoth Tarot deck, and the Book of HermesTarot, solidifying the imagery and symbolism we recognize today.

### IV. The Symbolism and Imagery of the Major and Minor Arcana

Over time, the imagery and meanings of the major and minor arcana evolved through references to astrology, numerology, Kabbalah, and other esoteric systems. The major arcana represent archetypal figures and spiritual concepts, while the minor arcana, comprising four different suits, reflect aspects of day-to-day life.

Influential figures like Arthur Edward Waite, guided by Pamela Colman Smith, integrated deep symbolism in their designs. Waite frequently included Christian imagery with mystical undertones, symbolizing the synthesis of various spiritual beliefs.

### V. Contemporary Tarot Practice: The Book of HermesTarot Today

In the modern era, Tarot has emerged as a popular tool for divination, self-discovery, and spiritual growth. Gaining inspiration from various mystical traditions, contemporary Tarot practitioners use the enriched symbolism and imagery of the major and minor arcana to interpret the nuanced messages revealed in readings.

The Book of HermesTarot has evolved from a pastime into a potent instrument for accessing the collective unconscious and unveiling the mysteries of life. The rich tapestry of traditions and influences interwoven through the evolution of The Book of HermesTarot provides modern seekers a powerful connection to the wisdom of the ages.

In conclusion, The Book of HermesTarot has a rich and intricate history marked by milestones in the evolution of playing cards, occultism, and divination, as well as the contributions of influential figures in the esoteric realms. The synthesis of diverse mystical traditions has resulted in a comprehensive and powerfully resonant system of symbolism and imagery. Today, The Book of HermesTarot serves as an invaluable tool for self-exploration and divination steeped in esoteric wisdom.
