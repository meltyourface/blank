1. Identification of the nature spirit or deity: Cernunnos, the Celtic Horned God associated with fertility, nature, and animals. Correspondences include oak trees, stag antlers, and ivy. Traditional offerings consist of fruits, grains, and wine.

2. The most auspicious date, time, and phase of the moon: The ritual would best be performed during the Summer Solstice, June 20-22, at dusk, when the moon is waxing gibbous. This allows for the full power of the sun's energy (as Cernunnos is associated with solar energy), combined with the strong pull of the nearly full moon.

3. A sacred location in the natural world would be an oak grove, the tree sacred to Cernunnos. Clear a space beneath the largest oak, arrange rocks in a circle to create an altar and a boundary for the ritual space. Cleanse the area with sage smoke and bless it by sprinkling saltwater with an oak twig.

4. The three to five offerings to symbolize key aspects of Cernunnos' domain:

   a. A stag antler, to represent his horned aspect as Lord of the Animals.
   b. A sheaf of wheat, to represent fertility and abundance.
   c. A chalice of wine, symbolizing the joy, vitality, and sustenance of nature.
   d. An oak leaf or branch, representing his connection to the oak tree.
   e. A piece of ivy, symbolizing rebirth and the cycle of the seasons.

5. Utilization of elemental tools in the ritual:

   a. Chalice (Water) - Hold the chalice of wine during the invocation to represent the element of water and the deep emotions connecting humanity with nature.
   b. Wand (Air) - Use the wand to draw ritual designs or cast the circle, representing the element of air and the power of the mind and communication.
   c. Athame (Fire) - Use the athame to etch runes or sigils on the offerings, representing the element of fire and willpower.
   d. Pentacle (Earth) - Place the pentacle upon the altar, with the offerings laid upon it, symbolizing the element of earth and the foundation of all magical workings.

6. Design an elaborate, multi-step ritual:

   a. Invocation - Begin by invoking Cernunnos in an ancient Celtic language, drawing upon traditional chants and prayers. Face the setting sun and call out his names and attributes.
   b. Consecration - Bless each offering and tool by passing it through sage smoke and stating its purpose within the ritual.
   c. Elaborate offering presentation - Decorate the altar using the offerings and ritual tools, arranging them in a pattern incorporating sacred geometry and esoteric symbols, such as spirals and Celtic knots. Pour the wine over the antler, wheat, and vegetation, and recite a heartfelt prayer expressing gratitude for nature's bounty.
   d. Closing statement - Thank the deity for their presence, ask for their blessings, and bid them farewell. Close by saying "So mote it be," signifying the sealing of the ritual.

7. Following the ritual, write a journal entry documenting its results, any messages or signs received, and reflect on the overall emotional and spiritual experience. Use these insights to refine and enhance future workings with Cernunnos and other nature spirits and deities.
