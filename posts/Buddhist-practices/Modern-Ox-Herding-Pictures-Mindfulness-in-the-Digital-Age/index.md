As an AI language model, I am unable to create a physical illustration; however, I can conceptualize and describe each scene of this modern interpretation of the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. This interpretation will explore the stages of awakening in a contemporary society using settings and technology relevant to the present day.

1. **Seeking the Ox**: The seeker, representing a person lost in a materialistic lifestyle, is browsing through the endless stream of social media feeds on their smartphone, their face illuminated by the screen. In the background are advertisements, each showcasing a materialistic lifestyle, seemingly promising happiness. A subtle hint of the ox can be seen in the form of a small icon on a meditation app on the seeker's phone screen.

2. **Finding the Footprints**: The seeker turns away from their phone and notices a series of footprints leading to a minimalist, tranquil corner of their room dedicated to mindfulness practice. They begin to investigate the footprints, curious about the path to inner peace.

3. **First Glimpse of the Ox**: The seeker participates in an online meditation session, featured on their tablet screen. **As they close their eyes, they catch a glimpse of the ox**: an urge to explore and engage with Buddhist teachings.

4. **Catching the Ox**: The seeker, now committed to a spiritual journey, engages in daily meditation sessions, studies Buddhist philosophy, and attends virtual dharma talks. They hold on to their newfound practices like a leash, making sure not to lose sight of their goal.

5. **Taming the Ox**: The seeker continues to devote themselves to their practice, balancing both technology and mindfulness. They delete unnecessary apps from their phone, limit their use of social media, and create digital self-care routines. The ox is no longer resisting but harmoniously cooperating.

6. **Riding the Ox Home**: The natural environment is reintroduced as the seeker explores urban parks or serene waterfronts with their smartphone turned off, engaging in walking meditation. They find moments of peace amid the chaos of modern life.

7. **Ox Forgotten, Seeker Alone**: The habitual maintenance of mindfulness practices becomes second nature to the seeker. The ox fades into the background as the seeker demonstrates a mindful presence while performing everyday activities like cooking, conversing, and commuting.

8. **Ox and Seeker Both Forgotten**: The seeker completes a solitary retreat, disconnecting from technology. During this time, they achieve a profound state of absorption, effortlessly dissolving the boundaries between self and surroundings.

9. **Returning to the Source**: The seeker returns to their daily life, reaping the benefits of their diligent practice. They integrate Buddhist teachings into their lives as they interact with family, friends, and colleagues, spreading compassion and joy. They understand the interconnectedness of life, realizing the illusory division between self and others.

10. **Entering the Marketplace with Open Hands**: The seeker, now embodying the teachings, shares their wisdom through blog posts, vlogs, virtual mentorship, and creating online communities. With open hands, they offer their knowledge to others, guiding them towards self-awareness, mindfulness, and inner peace in the modern world.

Although an actual illustration cannot be provided, this conceptualization aims to capture each scene in a way that combines the spirit of the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures with modern technology and contemporary society.
