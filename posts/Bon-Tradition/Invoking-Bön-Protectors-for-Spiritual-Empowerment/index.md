excerpt: >
  Compose a detailed Bon-style prayer, incorporating traditional Bon symbols and mantras, that specifically focuses on invoking the guidance of the deity Sipe Gyalmo and B\xF6n protectors to overcome personal obstacles, purify karmic obscurations, and attain heightened spiritual realization within the context of the Yungdrung Bon tradition. Incorporate elements from the Ma Gyud (Mother Tantra) and enrich the prayer with visualization techniques, recitation of sacred syllables, and offerings to B\xF6n protectors in order to enhance the complexity and potency of the prayer.

In the limitless expanse of pure space, I visualize the palace of the enlightened and mighty Sipe Gyalmo, the Queen of the World, and the powerful Bön protectors. I take refuge in their wisdom and heroic power to dispel my fears, obstacles, and to purify my karmic obscurations.

EMAHO! In the center of this celestial realm appears the sacred syllable OM, symbolizing enlightenment and great compassionate action. From this syllable, arises the fearsome and compassionate form of Sipe Gyalmo with her retinue of Bön protectors. They are radiant and pure, like the sun emerging from the clouds, and blaze with the wisdom fire of the Yungdrung Bon tradition.

I bow down and make offerings to you, Sipe Gyalmo, great mother of the Six Lokas, sovereign of all beings! You are the essence of all Buddhas and the embodiment of Mother Tantra. With your three faces, six arms, and three legs firmly planted on your mounts, you strike fear into the hearts of demons and liberate countless sentient beings from the cycles of suffering.

I offer you this praise:

Sipe Gyalmo, powerful queen of existence,
Distinguished sovereign of wrathful and wise deities,
Queen worthy of veneration by the Three Jewels and Bön!
I take refuge in you and your retinue of protectors!

Grant me your blessings, empowerments, and realizations,
As I traverse the path to enlightenment,
Liberate me from cyclic existence and the delusions of Samsara,
Guide me with your mighty presence, until I attain the state of a fully enlightened being.

I visualize my body, speech, and mind united as the sacred syllable HUNG,
Radiating in the heart of Sipe Gyalmo and her retinue,
I recite the mantra of Sipe Gyalmo, merging my essence with hers:

OM MA TRI MU YE SA LE DU

As the mantra resonates within me,
I feel a cascade of blessings and protection,
Flowing through my body, mind, and soul,
Obstacles dissolve, karmic obscurations burn away,
My heart, vibrant and pure, is imbued with limitless compassion,
I become one with the wisdom of the Yungdrung Bon tradition.

As I offer the essence of the Ma Gyud, Mother Tantra,
To the entire retinue of wrathful and enlightened Bön protectors,
They accept my offering and bestow blessings,
For the swiftness and depth of my realization,
For the benefit of all sentient beings.

As Sipe Gyalmo and the Bön protectors merge back into the emptiness,
Sealing their blessings within the syllable HUNG at my heart,
The imprints of their wisdom, compassion, and power remain with me,
I offer this potent power to benefit all living beings,
Enabling them to attain liberation, happiness, and ultimate realization.

May all beings be free from the bonds of suffering, and attain the all-encompassing peace of the Yungdrung Bon! SOHA!
