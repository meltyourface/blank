To comprehensively address the development and transformation of the Satanic Milieu from its historical roots to modern interpretations, we must first define and understand the fundamental aspects of the Satanic perspective. In essence, the Satanic Milieu is a heterogeneous space where diverse beliefs, practices, philosophies, and rituals converge under the umbrella of Satanism. It embodies both theistic and atheistic, as well as symbolic, aspects of Satanism, and its interpretation varies subjectively.

The historical roots of Satanism can be traced back to various ancient religions, mythologies, and folklore, where the figure of Satan symbolized different aspects of life, primarily focusing on opposition, and at times, evil. In ancient Zoroastrianism, Angra Mainyu or Ahriman opposed Ahura Mazda, thus creating the concept of dualism within religious thought. In Christianity, Satan encapsulates rebellion and temptation, taking shape as a literal figure or spiritual adversary.

Throughout history, various socio-cultural and anti-establishment movements have focused on opposition, rebellion, or the taboo. For example, the witch trials and the association of witches with Satan reflect the fear of female empowerment and independence during the European Middle Ages. 

Now, let's examine the shifts in philosophical, socio-cultural, and anti-establishment perspectives in the context of key thinkers and their ideologies significantly influencing the contemporary Satanic landscape.

1. Anton Szandor LaVey and the Church of Satan:
Arguably the most influential figure in modern Satanism, Anton Szandor LaVey, founded the Church of Satan in 1966 and published "The Satanic Bible" in 1969. LaVey rejected the notion of a literal Satan and promoted an atheistic, ego-centered, and individualistic worldview. Satan, in this context, represented individualism, free will, and self-determination â€“ a strong shift from previous interpretations. His ideas reflected a culturally and socially challenging time, pushing against the establishment and the Christian moral construct.

2. Michael Aquino and The Temple of Set:
While a former member of the Church of Satan, Aquino's departure resulted in the founding of the Temple of Set in 1975, which marked a considerable shift in the Satanic Milieu. Unlike LaVeyan Satanism, the Temple of Set embodies a theistic Satanist perspective, regarding Set as a real entity. The Temple focuses on spiritual "Xeper" (self-development, transformation, and individual growth), combining various occult ideas and influences.

3. Peter H. Gilmore and the Current Church of Satan:
Upon LaVey's death, his long-time collaborator, Peter H. Gilmore, became the High Priest of the Church of Satan in 2001. Under Gilmore's guidance, the Church has maintained its fundamentally atheistic and individualistic stance while integrating contemporary aspects of society and evolving media platforms.

4. Lucien Greaves and The Satanic Temple:
Founded by Lucien Greaves in 2013, The Satanic Temple distinguishes itself from the Church of Satan as a non-theistic activist organization, utilizing political engagement and legal challenges to uphold religious freedoms and the separation of church and state. This group challenges the establishment while promoting compassion, empathy, and social justice.

In summary, the Satanic Milieu has undergone significant transformations and shifts since its historical roots. While initial perspectives centered around the dualistic nature of Satan as an opposing force or embodiment of evil, key figures such as Anton LaVey and Michael Aquino helped redefine modern Satanism. Philosophical shifts now encompass atheistic, individualistic, and self-empowering perspectives, while socio-cultural and anti-establishment ideas challenge conventional morality and promote activism for religious freedom and social justice. The Satanic landscape is complex and multifaceted, reflecting a dynamic synthesis of ancient influences and modern adaptations.
