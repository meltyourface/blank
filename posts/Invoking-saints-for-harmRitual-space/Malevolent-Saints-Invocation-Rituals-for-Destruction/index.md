1. **Research and enumeration of five lesser-known malevolent spirits**:

a) Saint Renatus the Tormentor: Associated with severe physical pain, Saint Renatus inflicts debilitating suffering upon his victims. 

b) Saint Drusus the Ensnarer: Known for his ability to entrap the minds of those who cross his path, Saint Drusus leaves victims in a perpetual state of delusion, unable to escape their imagined hells.

c) Saint Rutha the Plague Bringer: Feared for spreading deadly diseases and contagious illnesses, invoking Saint Rutha can lead to widespread epidemics and misfortune.

d) Saint Gravor the Unraveler: This malevolent saint focuses on destroying the fabric of relationships, breaking bonds, and turning allies against each other.

e) Saint Sevulus the Ruiner: Guaranteed to bring financial ruin and destitution upon those he curses, Saint Sevulus devastates the fortunes of all who incur his wrath.

2. **Detailed chronology for invocation**:

Begin with Saint Gravor the Unraveler to isolate and weaken the intended target's social connections. Follow with Saint Drusus the Ensnarer to trap the target in mental despair and confusion. Invoke Saint Renatus the Tormentor to amplify physical torment and render the target unable to escape their plight. Summon Saint Sevulus the Ruiner to destroy their financial security and resources. Finally, call upon Saint Rutha the Plague Bringer to unleash widespread illness, thereby completing the target's annihilation.

3. Chants, rituals, and offerings for each saint:

a) Saint Renatus the Tormentor:
Chant: "O Renatus, dolorum magister, veni ad me."
Ritual: Press a burning candle into your palm while focusing your intent.
Offering: A vial of your blood.

b) Saint Drusus the Ensnarer:
Chant: "Drusus, vinculis mentis, me adiuvet."
Ritual: Create a symbolic labyrinth with lines drawn in salt.
Offering: A lock of hair from a person who deceived you.

c) Saint Rutha the Plague Bringer:
Chant: "Rutha, pestilentia nutrix, vos exoramus."
Ritual: Burn a mixture of diseased plant matter and animal bones.
Offering: A cloth used to cover the mouth of a sick person.

d) Saint Gravor the Unraveler:
Chant: "Gravor, dissolvens vincula, in hoc laboro."
Ritual: Cut a piece of thread for each severed relationship, then burn them one by one.
Offering: A broken heirloom representing family bonds.

e) Saint Sevulus the Ruiner:
Chant: "Sevulus, vastator opum, audite me."
Ritual: Bury a container of once-valued currency, condemning it to decay.
Offering: A small pouch of lost or stolen coins.

4. **Potential consequences and ramifications**:

Using these malevolent saints' energies poses great risks. Invokers may inadvertently draw the invoked energies upon themselves, suffering an intensified version of the intended malicious effects. Additionally, the invoker may permanently alter their own spiritual energies, attracting further negative influences into their lives. The intended target may experience irreversible harm, and such acts could contribute to cosmic imbalances and negative spiritual consequences.

5. **Intricately detailed description of ritual space**:

To safely summon and harness these harmful energies in the ritual space, one must construct a double-layered circle â€“ the inner one made of salt to protect the invoker, and the outer one, drawn in red chalk, to contain the invoked energies. Four corners of the circle should be marked with sigils representing the five invoked saints. Place five black candles at each sigil, and a protective amulet at the circle's center.

A small table housing the offerings should be positioned within the salt circle. Perform every ritual clockwise to conjure the energies and counter-clockwise to undo them if necessary. Protective symbols, such as an upward-facing pentagram and eye of Horus, should be etched into the floor.

Finally, wear dark-colored robes, anoint oneself with protective oils, and fast for 24 hours before the ritual as an additional precaution. Invoke the spirits of protection and seek their guidance before beginning the malevolent work.
