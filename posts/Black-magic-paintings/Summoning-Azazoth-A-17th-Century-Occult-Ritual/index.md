  I.
  
  Morpheus Nocturne, thy painter's hand unseen,
  From distant 17th century's shadowy dream,
  In cloaked deception, brought forth a myst'ry,
  "The Dweller in the Abyss," where Azazoth awaits.
  
  Yee shades of black, impulsive, crushing weight,
  Drawn from secret galleries of lost tomes,
  We beckon through the spiraling serpent dance,
  To breach the curtain with infernal fire and smoke.
  
  Talismans of daemon's craft, align upon our circle drawn,
  A testament to the broken seals of forgotten arts,
  We anchor the paths through interwoven sigils and symbols,
  Fusing past, present, and future in this binding chant.
  
  II.
  
  Arise, Azazoth, the grotesque chaos in form,
  The shifter of skin, the unspeakable night,
  Six heads of wrath, each with burning eyes,
  Jaws agape, exhaling sulfuric nightmares upon.
  
  Three tails, conjoined as winding roots, 
  A tangled ocean of shadows, a piercing storm,
  Tentacles of malice, as per Maelphas' vision,
  Summoned unto our mortal realm, the terrestrial plane.
  
  III.
  
  In nomine Lunae, vinculum daemonum!
  With words of ancient tongues, fealty, we vow,
  To thine abyssal power and wind-whipped might,
  We extend our eager hands, seeking thy dominion.
  
  Gift us words of cunning deceit, manipulate the order,
  Distort reality's fabric, sew chaos upon the land,
  Azazoth, the sovereign of night eternal,
  Join with us in the dance, until the last embers fade away.
  
  Pour unto us those lustful, wrathful tides,
  That we may drench the dreams of men in darkness,
  And ascend, in flesh and heart, upon thine unhallowed throne,
  As fervent servants of the eternal abyss.
  
  In nomine Azazoth, descend, descend now!
  Upon our sacred circle, thy visage immaculate,
  United, thou shalt spread thy wings and blot the rising sun,
  Ruling as the glorified Harbingers of Chaos henceforth.
