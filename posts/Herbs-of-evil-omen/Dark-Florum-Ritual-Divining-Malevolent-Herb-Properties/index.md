## Title: The Ritual of the Dark Florum

Objective: To unveil hidden knowledge about the malevolent characteristics of nefarious herbs through divination and gain a deeper understanding of their true nature.

Required Items:

1. **Seven Ominous Herbs**:
  - Belladonna (Deadly Nightshade)
  - Hemlock
  - Monkshood (Aconite)
  - Henbane (Hyoscyamus)
  - Mandrake
  - Wolf's Bane (Arnica)
  - Black Hellebore
2. **Sinister Altar**:
  - Obsidian slab
  - Silver chalice
  - Candleholders made from the remains of ancient trees
  - Dark, hooded ceremonial cloak (worn during the ritual)
3. **Distinct Divination Tool**:
  - Empyrean Onyx Sphere (dark crystal ball)

Preparations:
**Step 1**: Collection of the Ominous Herbs
Gather the aforementioned herbs, ensuring these are harvested under a moonless night sky for optimal darkness. Each herb must be treated with respect and recite a chant of invocation, acknowledging their power before the collection:

 "Ancient herb of shadow and night, Grant me vision, unveil thy might."
**Step 2**: Preparation of the Sinister Altar
Prior to the ritual, cleanse the obsidian slab with sacred water infused with the petals of a black rose. Assemble the silver chalice, candleholders, and dark cloak nearby, readily available for use during the ritual.
**Step 3**: Prepare the Ritual Space
Place the obsidian slab on the ground, positioning it beneath a canopy of trees where the closest reflections of the stars in the night sky can be observed. Light the candles within the holders, surrounding the slab symmetrically. Fill the silver chalice with a mixture of water and drops of herbal extracts from the seven ominous herbs, then adorn the cloak.

Ritual Performance:
**Step 1**: Invocation
Kneel before the obsidian altar and recite the invocation, addressing the dark forces which govern the knowledge of the herbs:

 "Spirits of the wicked flora, Reveal thy secrets, I implore thee. Bestow upon me thy dire truth, Enlighten me with thy esoteric truths."
**Step 2**: Herb Offerings
Place each herb, one by one, onto the obsidian slab, drawing the sigil of the corresponding malevolence. As each herb is placed, recite its name and implore its guidance:

 "Belladonna, Queen of Deadly Night, Hemlock, bringer of eternal night, Wolf's Bane, terror in canine sight, Henbane, the mind's ghostly plight, Monkshood, Death's swift appetite, Mandrake, root of hidden fright, Black Hellebore, the poisonous rite, Together guide my divination flight."
**Step 3**: Divination
Hold the Empyrean Onyx Sphere above the sinister herbs and softly chant:

 "Spirits from the darkness, show me the way, Through this Empyrean Onyx Sphere, Divulge the cryptic truth unseen, Convey the knowledge, all will hear."

Peer into the dark depths of the crystal, discerning the shifting patterns or symbols formed. Focus on the feelings invoked by these symbols and allow the knowledge contained within them to enter your mind.
**Step 4**: Interpretation
Take note of the symbols you have seen in the crystal and identify their connection to the chosen herbs. Observe the knowledge provided about the malevolence of these plants, uncovering their intricate ties to the arcane and better understanding their nefarious characteristics.

Closure: After the revelation, thank the spirits and herbs for their guidance. Safely extinguish the candles and carefully return the herbs to their natural habitat, imparting gratitude for their wisdom. Store the dark crystal ball in a place of reverence as it now possesses insights into the unfathomable properties of the ominous herbs that dwell within the darkest corners of nature.
