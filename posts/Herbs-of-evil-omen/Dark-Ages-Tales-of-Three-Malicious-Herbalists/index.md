In the darkest corners of ancient history, a malevolent society emerged, spreading its vile touch across the tapestry of time. These practitioners were notorious for their cunning use of herbs of evil omen, shaping history through wicked means. From the savage deserts of Mesopotamia to the regal courts of medieval France, their reach knew no boundaries. This tale of malice and treachery follows the lives of three infamous figures – each bound to the others by a sinister thread.

In antiquity, Araxes was known as the deadliest of herbalists. He was a travel-worn merchant turned scholar who came from the eastern edges of the known world. Renowned for his insatiable curiosity and dark expertise, he had scoured the earth for the most virulent plants, absorbing knowledge from Babylonian mages, Egyptian pharaohs, and Indian yogis. Every rare and fearsome herb known to exist was well studied by Araxes. It was whispered that he knew the mysterious art of preserving their malicious essence, manipulating the plants into sentient abominations that bent to his will.

In the 12th century, a woman named Lilias emerged in France. The wife of a noble, she was notorious for her indulgence in occult arts and medicines. Like Araxes, Lilias sought the most powerful and poisonous herbs from the furthest corners of the world. With every parcel that arrived at her castle, her collection grew. She would spend hours in her chamber, meticulously grinding and mixing the substances, conjuring potions and concoctions that masked their true intent. For Lilias sought the deepest kind of power – the power to control her husband, the nobility, and ultimately, the throne itself.

During the summer of 1434, a scholar at the Vatican named Giovanni became known as the Prince of Venenum – a master of poison. Unlike the evil herbalists who came before him, Giovanni did not crave direct power. Instead, he used his expertise in cultivating and harvesting the herbs of evil omen to manipulate others, fulfilling their dark desires in exchange for loyalty to his cause.

In Italy, the second Vatican's vaults contained the life's work of these three sinister figures. The parchments were devoted to the cultivation, arcane knowledge, and diabolical techniques of these enigmatic plants. The effects of their malevolent experiments on their victims were chillingly accurate, the processes chilling their tales.

Araxes conquered cities by releasing his sentient abominations – a plague of undead rose, twisted and warped to grotesque ends. Slowly chanted incantations in his guttural tongue, he commanded these desiccated servants to spread their warped herbal concoctions throughout the land, consuming all who breathed their sinister spores.

Lilias' thirst for power warped the nobility, bending it to her whims. Her closest confidantes reported agonized screams from those who tasted her honeyed poisons. Each victim's body contorted and putrescent, until their very lives waned into darkness, leaving only a terrible mockery of their former selves at her feet. Lilias' power grew to control entire provinces and beyond.

The influence of Giovanni, the Prince of Venenum, cast a shadow across Europe, spreading his knowledge among his faithful students. They carried his work, infiltrated courts, and dispatched rivals, solidifying the grip of their sinister guild on the world. Through their mastery of the arcane, they were bound by invisible threads, united by their nefarious purpose, and intoxicated by their insatiable thirst for power.

Such were the lives of these notorious figures, bound by fate and hatred, each weaving a tale of darkness, horror, and profound malevolence.
