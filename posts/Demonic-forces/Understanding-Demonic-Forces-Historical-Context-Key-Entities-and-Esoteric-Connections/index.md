To tackle this comprehensive knowledge challenge, let's break it down into a few manageable parts:

1. Historical context of demonic forces
2. Prominent figures and key energies
3. Esoteric correspondences within multiple belief systems
4. Interconnectivity between such forces 
5. Expanded awareness application for initiates

**Historical Context of Demonic Forces**

The concept of demons and demonic forces has persisted throughout different cultures and historical periods. The earliest association can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia, where deities represented natural forces and specific regions. Over time, some deities were deemed malevolent and associated with chaos and destruction. 

In later religions, such as Zoroastrianism, the battle between good and evil was more emphasized. Angra Mainyu, the chief force of evil, challenged Ahura Mazda, the force of good. This theme of duality laid the groundwork for subsequent concepts of good and evil, angels and demons.

With the rise of monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, the idea of fallen angels and evil entities further evolved. Demons were seen as agents of evil, serving under a powerful demon lord, commonly referred to as Satan or Iblis, attempting to corrupt humanity and undermine divine order.

**Prominent Figures and Key Energies**

In the study of demons and demonic forces, several prominent figures have emerged across various belief systems. Some of these entities serve as embodiments of specific energies or aspects, such as greed, lust, wrath, or pride. **We can look at a few examples from diverse religious contexts**:

- Beelzebub: Originally a Philistine deity, it later became synonymous with Satan in Christian and Hebrew demonology. Beelzebub is considered the Lord of the Flies and is associated with corruption and degradation.

- Lilith: Stemming from Jewish mythology, Lilith is thought to be the first woman created before Eve. She refused to be subservient to Adam and was subsequently demonized. In demonology, Lilith is known as a seductive, disruptive, and dangerous entity associated with lust.

- Azazel: Initially a scapegoat in Judaic rituals, Azazel came to symbolize sin and rebellion. In Islamic theology, Azazel is equated with Iblis, who disobeyed God and tempted humanity.

- Mara: In Buddhism, Mara is the demon lord who tempted Buddha during his path to enlightenment. Mara represents desire, illusion, and death, which Buddhists believe keep one trapped in the cycle of suffering.

**Esoteric Correspondences Within Multiple Belief Systems**

The esoteric study of demonic forces often draws parallels and underlying connections within various religious and magical systems. This comparative methodology can help us find common patterns, themes, and motifs related to demons and their energies. **For instance**:

- The Kabbalistic Tree of Life: In Jewish mysticism, the Kabbalistic Tree of Life represents the path of spiritual development. The demonic counterpart, called the Qliphoth, serves as the shadow side to the tree.

- Hermeticism: A branch of esotericism originating from the Mediterranean and heavily influenced by Platonic thought, Hermeticism focuses on alchemical transformation and the balancing of opposing forces.

- Demonology: A study within many belief systems, demonology seeks to understand and classify demonic entities, often with the goal of commanding, controlling, or seeking protection from such forces.

**Interconnectivity Between Demonic Forces**

The relationships between demons and their energies can be both collaborative and antagonistic. The interconnectivity of demonic forces often reflects the duality (or multiplicity) of a belief system - for each virtue, there may be a corresponding vice, and for each angel, there might be a demon counterpart.

In certain occult practices, the aim is to harness the energies of various demonic forces to achieve a specific goal, such as summoning a demon to gain knowledge, power, or control. This idea, however, might not be inherently evil but rather a pursuit of understanding and integrating the darker aspects of human nature.

**Expanded Awareness Application for Initiates**

For initiates seeking spiritual growth and development, understanding and exploring demonic forces can offer valuable insights into their own psyche, belief systems, and the nature of existence. By embracing and integrating the shadow sides of oneself, it is believed that an individual can achieve wholeness, transcendence, and enlightenment.

Through the study of demonic forces and their esoteric correspondences, initiates might:

- Approach spiritual development holistically
- Learn to balance opposing energies, such as light and shadow
- Develop a greater understanding of the hidden and esoteric aspects of reality
- Recognize potentially negative or destructive tendencies within themselves and work to overcome them

In conclusion, the investigation of demonic forces spans a rich history involving numerous prominent figures and key energies. Esoteric correspondences within multiple belief systems offer a fascinating gateway into the study of these powerful entities and their interconnected relationships. By examining these ideas, an initiate can apply an expanded awareness to their spiritual development, ultimately seeking balance, growth, and self-understanding.
