To embark on the comprehensively complex journey of understanding the significance of the Bear in esoteric symbology, indigenous spiritual traditions, and its connection to inner alchemy, transformation, and celestial constellations, we must first lay a proper foundation. This undertaking will involve examining the core attributes of the Bear, how it has been represented in various spiritual and esoteric traditions, its relation to alchemical transformation, and lastly, how the constellation Ursa Major provides a celestial aspect that weaves the underlying themes together. By doing so, we will gain a comprehensive, holistic insight into the universal wisdom shared between traditions across space and time.

Core Attributes of the Bear:
The Bear, as a symbol, has been a potent force in the imaginations of multiple civilizations for millennia, spanning across spiritual, esoteric, and astronomical systems. It is revered in indigenous cultures for its strength, courage, protection, and its ability to straddle the worlds between the physical and spiritual realms. Additionally, the Bear symbolizes introspection, the cycle of rebirth, and a profound connection to Mother Earth and the cosmos.

Esoteric Symbology and Indigenous Spiritual Traditions:
In esoteric circles, the Bear can be linked to various archetypes due to its unique qualities. For instance, the tarot card "Strength" resonates with the power and inner fortitude of the Bear, while its inclination for hibernation during the winter months symbolizes a period of reflection and introspection that leads to transformation.

Similarly, in indigenous spiritual traditions, the Bear is considered a magical and revered creature. For instance, in Native American mythology, it is believed that the spirit of the Bear guides warriors in battle, offering strength, protection, and wisdom. Many shamans and medicine people call upon the Bear for healing and spiritual guidance, as it is believed to embody the power of introspection that leads to self-realization.

The Process of Inner Alchemy and Transformation:
Inner alchemy, the process of transforming one's psychological and spiritual self to achieve a higher state of consciousness, can be linked to the Bear's symbolism. The Bear's cycles of hibernation parallel the internal journey, where an individual must confront their shadow and learn from it, just as the Bear retreats into the darkness to learn from its dreams and emerge stronger from its slumber.

One could argue that the Bear represents the "Nigredo" stage of alchemy, the initial stage of breaking down the self, confronting darkness and chaos, which ultimately leads to purification and refinement in the later stages. Thus, connecting the Bear to the transformative process of inner alchemy.

The Celestial Constellations:
The role of the Bear in celestial symbolism further unites these various systems of thought. The constellation Ursa Major, also known as the "Great Bear," has been an essential constellation in the navigation and storytelling of countless cultures. By observing the movements of this celestial Bear, ancient civilizations have discerned the rhythms of time, seasons, and cosmic evolution.

Summary and Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Bear is an all-encompassing symbol, manifesting in esoteric symbologies, indigenous spiritual traditions, inner alchemical processes, and celestial constellations. Its characteristics and qualities have resonated with countless civilizations, linking these disparate systems in a cohesive web of universal wisdom. Through examining the Bear's innate connection to themes of strength, introspection, rebirth, and cosmic cycles, we gain valuable insight into our own transformative journey—bridging the microcosmic with the macrocosmic, and the terrestrial with the celestial. Indeed, the indomitable spirit of the Bear continues to inspire and guide us as we unlock the secrets of our shared universal heritage.
