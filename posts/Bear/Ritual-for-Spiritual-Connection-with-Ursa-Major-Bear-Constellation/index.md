## Title: The Ritual of Ursine Majesty

### I. Preparation

1. Choose a location with a clear view of the Ursa Major constellation on a night when the constellation is visible and ascendant.
2. Create a sacred space by marking out a circular boundary with either chalk or crushed herbs, representing the boundary between the mundane and the mystical world of the Bear.
3. Acquire bear-themed relics, such as a bear skin, bear claws, teeth, and a bear skull. If such items are unavailable, substitute with wooden or stone bear sculptures and artwork representing bears.
4. Set up a central altar in the circle with a large star map of Ursa Major and an unlit beeswax candle at each of the seven major stars of the constellation - marking the positions of these stars upon the altar.

### II. The Opening

1. Light a fire in a small brazier or cauldron and place it before the altar, representing the combined energy of the celestial Bear and the participants.
2. Purify yourself and any other participants with a mixture of crushed juniper and sage, burning it over the fire and letting the smoke envelop everyone present.
3. Don the bear relics, with the bearskin worn over the shoulders and the bear claws and teeth fashioned into amulets and worn around the neck.

### III. Invocation

1. Stand in the center of the circle, facing the constellation of Ursa Major, and raise your arms towards the heavens while holding a wooden staff, preferably sourced from an oak tree.
2. **Chant the invocation in the ancient bear language**:

"Bërya Ursa, numah shenga!
Iku narë vorya, cëma linga!
Krëma-farya, ulvë estara!
Garë Ursa Majora, drëvë yë hwarya!"

(Translation: Mighty Bear, guide and guard! From the stars descend, and lend your power! By the fire's light, we summon thee! Great Ursa Major, come to us now!)

3. As you chant, visualize the constellation glowing brighter, and a brilliant beam of starlight connecting the constellation to your circle.

### IV. The Bear Dance

1. To physically and spiritually connect with the summoned essence of Ursa Major, perform a circular dance around the fire, mimicking the movements and rhythms of a bear.
2. As the dance continues, amplify the atmosphere by beating drums, shaking rattles, and singing bear-themed chants with the other participants.

### V. The Offering

1. Gather a token offering of honey, ripe berries, and smoked fish, presenting them on a wooden platter at the altar of Ursa Major.
2. Say a prayer in gratitude, dedicating the offering to the Great Bear spirit.

### VI. The Culmination

1. As the energy in the circle reaches its peak, light the seven beeswax candles on the altar, symbolically establishing a link between the star map and Ursa Major.
2. Meditate before the altar, opening yourself to the wisdom, power, and presence of the Great Bear spirit, and be prepared for visions, insights, or dreams related to the Bear.

### VII. Closing

1. Thank the Great Bear for its presence, guidance, and gifts.
2. Carefully extinguish the seven candles and the brazier fire.
3. Store the bear relics and any remaining offerings in a safe, respectful manner.

Anticipated Outcomes & Experiences:

During and after the completion of this ritual, participants may experience an increased sense of spiritual connection to the Bear, insights or visions related to their life path, an enhanced awareness of their instincts and intuition, and transformative effects such as augmented strength, determination, and resilience. These experiences will potentially lead to a profound understanding of one's connection with the natural world, the celestial realm, and the wisdom of the ancient Bear spirit.
