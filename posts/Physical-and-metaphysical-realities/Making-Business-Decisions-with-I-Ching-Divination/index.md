In order to elucidate a pragmatic application of I Ching divination within the decision-making process, we will first establish a specific scenario that requires guidance on personal or professional choices. 

Scenario: A young entrepreneur, Alex, is at a crossroads whether to accept a partnership offer from another company or to continue independent growth for their startup business.

Step 1: Frame the question
Alex formulates their question as follows: "What is the best course of action for my business - accepting the partnership or continuing with independent growth?"

Step 2: Casting the I Ching
In order to tap into the physical and metaphysical realms, Alex connects with their intuition and concentrates on the question while tossing three coins six times. The resulting pattern of heads (Yang) and tails (Yin) will create a hexagram, with each toss determining one of the six lines.

Step 3: Analyzing the hexagram
After casting the I Ching, Alex receives Hexagram 43, known as "Breakthrough" or "Resoluteness." This hexagram consists of five solid (Yang) lines topped by one broken (Yin) line. Interpreting the hexagram, Alex considers the following meanings:

- A strong, decisive action is required to overcome an obstacle.
- The significance of the lone Yin line on top suggests that although elements of the potential partnership may seem appealing, a subtle but significant resistance (Yin) exists.
- The five Yang lines below indicate a powerful force suggesting that independent growth holds strong potential.

Step 4: Reflecting on the advice
Alex reflects on the advice provided by the I Ching, understanding that the breakthrough requires acknowledging the complexity of interconnected symbols and harnessing their collective power. Hexagram 43 suggests that to achieve success, a resolute decision must be made, leaning towards the force of independent growth.

Step 5: Seek further clarification (if necessary)
If Alex feels uncertain about the advice, they could seek further clarification by asking a follow-up question or considering the message received in relation to their current situation.

In conclusion, incorporating I Ching divination into the decision-making process allows for a deeper exploration of the interconnected physical and metaphysical forces at play. In this scenario, the ancient divinatory tool provided intricate guidance, helping Alex determine the best course of action for their startup business. Alex embraces the power of I Ching, which offers a thoughtful approach to examining the interplay of Yin and Yang energies, leading to a well-considered and informed decision.
