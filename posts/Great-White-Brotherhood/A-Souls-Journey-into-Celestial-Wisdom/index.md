Through the labyrinth of darkness, a lone soul strides,
A quest, luminous and transcendental, won't be denied.
Journeying through a mystic landscape, seeking profound truth,
Embracing the echoes of eternity, seeking proof.

In the ether of dimensions, shifting sands of time,
Engulfed by celestial omens, Saturn's silent chime.
Through sapphiric waters and emerald woods, a path unwinds,
To a citadel of echoes, of ancient masters' minds.

The soul treads on sacred ground, where mortals seldom fare,
As myriad whispers guide it, the Incarnate One is there.
Luminary spirits emerge, luminous and divine,
Invoking sacred knowledge, from beyond the veils of time.

The Seraph of Celestial Lore unfurls its gilded wings,
Revealing to the searching soul, the mysteries it brings.
The Cherub of Eternal Light unveils the Cosmic Tree,
Its roots spread deep, unyielding, into infinity.

Wisdom floods the earnest soul, illumination dawns,
The astral albatross soars — its shackles now unbound.
Elemental bonds unravel, earthly fetters break,
Merging with the sacred union, a cosmic harmony awake.

And in the holy nexus, the Brotherhood appears,
Their radiant, diaphanous forms allay all mortal fears.
With shimmering hands, they reach out and touch the seeker's brow,
Imbuing divine essence, in the presence they avow.

With mastery, these entities chant secrets steeped in lore,
Vestiges of a primal age, the soul has sought before.
Within the sacred circle, the enigmatic soul ascends,
Eclipsing erstwhile boundaries, in Knowledge that transcends.

Fused in sublime union, the confluence of realms embrace,
In transcendental symphony, the euphony of grace.
Illumined by the Brotherhood, adorned in silken stoles,
Transfigured in the spectral light, reborn — an ascended soul.
