To complete this complex task, I will first gather the essential sources of the Arkonian Temple tradition and then analyze them for connections and patterns concerning lineage, authors, milestones, and interconnected themes. 

1. **Gathering the sacred texts, scriptures, and ancient inscriptions**:
I have gathered a comprehensive collection that includes:

- The Great Grimoire of Arkon, a foundational text authored by High Priest Zenon the Wise;
- The Enigmatic Scrolls of Atar, written by an unknown yet influential leader of the Temple;
- Chamber Carvings of the Hidden Sanctuary, a series of images believed to predate even the High Priesthood;
- The Evolving Tome of Xil, a living document that has been contributed to by generations of Arkonian Templars.

2. **Identifying the key authors and influential High Priests**:
Within the collected works, I have traced the lineage and found that significant authors and high priests include:

- Zenon the Wise, the first High Priest of Arkon and author of the Great Grimoire;
- Valeria the Mystic, a seer whose prophecies inspired the Temple leaders to embark on a spiritual journey of evolution;
- Ulgar the Stoic, a powerful High Priest who expanded the Arkonian Temple's influence and increased the complexity of its esoteric system;
- Astara the Illuminated, whose metaphysical teachings blended ancient wisdom with novel insights and deepened the Arkonian Temple's allure.

3. **Chronological milestones in the evolution of the Arkonian Esoteric Belief System**:

- Founding: Zenon the Wise established the Arkonian Temple, emphasizing balance, wisdom-seeking, and harnessing the energies of the cosmos; 
- Expansion: Valeria the Mystic envisioned a more expansive, inclusive, and evolving system, leading to a dynamic shift in beliefs and practices;
- Consolidation: Ulgar the Stoic brought together disparate teachings, formalizing and solidifying the core ideas into a comprehensive esoteric system;
- Enlightenment: Astara the Illuminated refined the Temple's teachings, synthesizing ancient wisdom with burgeoning metaphysical thought.

4. **Analyzing cultural context, symbolism, and allegorical themes**:
The Arkonian Temple's beliefs and teachings are intrinsically linked to the broader cultural milieu from which they arose. Symbolism used in sacred texts includes the Serpent of Transmutation, the Crystalline Orb of Insight, and the Sacred Flame of Purification. Allegorical themes include the harmonious interplay of darkness and light, the journey of self-discovery, and the eternal quest for wisdom and understanding.

In conclusion, the Arkonian Temple tradition is a complex and adaptive esoteric belief system deeply rooted in ancient wisdom and responsive to changing cultural and metaphysical landscapes. By compiling and analyzing the collected sacred texts, scriptures, and inscriptions, I have provided unprecedented insights into the ongoing mystique and allure of the Arkonian Temple and its evolving tradition.
