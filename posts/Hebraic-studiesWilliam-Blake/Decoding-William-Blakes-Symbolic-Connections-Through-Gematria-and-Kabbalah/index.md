To accomplish this task, we will delve into William Blake's artistic and poetic works, as well as the Hebrew gematria technique, to unveil the hidden messages and symbolic connections present in both Blake's works and the Bible.

Blake's fascination with Hebraic studies and biblical texts had a profound impact on his life and art. As a mystic and visionary, he was deeply inspired by the ancient Jewish teachings, particularly the Kabbalah, which is a form of esoteric Jewish mysticism. It's important to note that Blake's knowledge of the Kabbalah was likely acquired through second-hand sources and not from direct study of the primary texts. Nevertheless, the Kabbalistic concepts meshed well with his own brand of mysticism, as seen in his artistic creations.

Gematria is a technique that assigns a numerical value to each Hebrew letter and uses these numbers to draw connections between different words, texts, and ideas. Utilizing gematria as a tool for deciphering Blake's art may reveal previously unnoticed associations and interpretations.

To start, we can examine Blake's work "Jerusalem," his most ambitious work in which he aimed to create a new mythology. Within the poem, we find multiple instances of Hebraic influences, such as the names of biblical characters and places, which often possess additional layers of meaning when examined through gematria.

Consider the name Jerusalem itself. It consists of the Hebrew letters ירושלים (Yud, Resh, Vav, Shin, Lamed, Yud, Mem), which have numerical values of 10, 200, 6, 300, 30, 10 and 40, respectively. When these values are added together, the sum is 596. This number can be used to draw connections with other words and phrases of significance, either within the poem or biblical texts.

**One such connection can be made with a biblical figure**: Melchizedek. In Genesis, Melchizedek is the king of Salem and a high priest, who blesses Abraham and receives a tithe from him. The numerical value of his name, מלכי־צדק (Mem, Lamed, Kaf, Yud, Tsadi, Dalet, Qof), adds up to 596, the same as Jerusalem in gematria.

This correspondence suggests a possible interpretation that Blake perceived Melchizedek as a spiritual precursor to his vision of Jerusalem—a city of peace and universal brotherhood. Both the poem "Jerusalem" and the biblical figure of Melchizedek are, in a sense, embodiments of this spiritual ideal of unity.

As one delves further into the Kabbalistic influences on Blake's work, his depictions of the "Divine Human Form" or the "Adam Kadmon" become more apparent. The concept of the Divine Human Form, derived from Kabbalistic thought, represents the macrocosmic unity of God and humanity.

Blake's portrayal of the Adam Kadmon can be seen in his painting "The Ancient of Days," where he illustrates a God-like figure with human characteristics. By melding the spiritual and mortal realms, Blake sought to convey the idea that all humans possess divinity within themselves. This notion aligns with the teachings of the Kabbalah in which God's essence is concealed within the physical world, and humanity plays a vital role in unlocking the divine sparks through spiritual growth and enlightenment.

In conclusion, a gematria-inspired exploration of William Blake's work combined with an examination of his interest in Hebraic studies and the Kabbalah reveals a rich tapestry of concealed messages and interwoven symbols that elucidate the mystical depths of his artistic and poetic expressions. While the accuracy of his mystical depictions may be subjective and open to interpretation, the genius of Blake's visionary language and symbolism endures as a testament to his remarkable creative mind.
