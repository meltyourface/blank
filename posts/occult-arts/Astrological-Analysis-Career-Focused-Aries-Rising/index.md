To construct an elaborate astrological natal chart, we first need to gather important birth information including the date, time, and location of birth. For the purpose of this example, let's use the following birth details:

- Date of Birth: 1st January 1990
- Time of Birth: 12:00 PM
- Place of Birth: New York City, USA

Next, we will follow these steps to create the natal chart:

1. Determine the ascendant sign or rising sign, by calculating the exact degree of the zodiac ecliptic coming over the horizon at the time of birth.
2. Position the planets and other celestial bodies using precise astronomical data (such as an ephemeris) according to their location at the birth time.
3. Divide the zodiac into twelve houses starting from the ascendant sign and incorporate the planets and celestial bodies into each house based on their positions.
4. Identify the aspects, the angle relationships between planets, by calculating their positions in relation to one another, incorporating conjunctions, oppositions, trines, and squares.

For this example, let's say the natal chart has:

- Rising Sign: Aries
- Sun in Capricorn (House 10)
- Moon in Gemini (House 3)
- Mercury in Sagittarius (House 9)
- Venus in Aquarius (House 11)
- Mars in Libra (House 7)
- Jupiter in Cancer (House 4)
- Saturn in Capricorn (House 10)
- Uranus in Leo (House 5)
- Neptune in Scorpio (House 8)
- Pluto in Virgo (House 6)

Now that we have created the natal chart, we can interpret the planetary positions and their relationships.

**Dominant elements**: Earth (Sun and Saturn in Capricorn, Pluto in Virgo) and Air (Moon in Gemini, Venus in Aquarius, Mars in Libra)

**Dominant planetary rulers**: Mars (Aries rising), Saturn (Capricorn Sun), Mercury (Gemini Moon)

**Character**:
This individual is likely ambitious, practical, and highly competent when it comes to achieving long-term objectives. The Sun in Capricorn imparts an air of responsibility and dedication to goals while the Moon in Gemini contributes to versatility, curiosity, and adaptability. Their Aries rising lends an assertive, pioneering spirit that manifests in their ability to take action and lead.

**Strengths**:
The conjunction of Sun and Saturn in the 10th house speaks to a potential for great success in professional endeavors. They have the discipline and determination to rise steadily within hierarchical structures. The Moon in the 3rd house reveals a strong drive for knowledge as well as a knack for communication.

**Challenges**:
Their Mars in Libra in the 7th house may cause indecisiveness when it comes to making decisions or taking action. Balancing their own needs versus the needs of others could be an ongoing challenge. A tense square between the Moon in Gemini and Jupiter in Cancer could result in emotional turbulence or exaggerated appetites.

Life Path:
With a focus on the upper hemisphere of the chart, this individual will likely experience growth and accomplishment through career and public life. Harnessing their inherent determination, pragmatism, and ability to communicate effectively, they can find great satisfaction in building a lasting legacy. Their lifelong journey may involve learning to balance personal life and relationships with professional ambition.
