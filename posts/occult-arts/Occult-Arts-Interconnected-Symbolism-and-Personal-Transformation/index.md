To tackle this knowledge challenge, we will first identify three distinct occult arts and summarize their core principles. Second, we'll analyze the relationships among them, exploring patterns and connections. Finally, we'll synthesize a coherent philosophical perspective that captures the essence of these arts.

Occult Art 1: Astrology
Core Principles:
1. **Cosmic Correspondence**: Everything in the cosmos is interconnected, and celestial bodies like planets and stars influence life on Earth.
2. **Natal Chart**: A person's birth time, date, and location are crucial to calculating their astrological profile (e.g., sun sign, moon sign, and ascendant), which potentially reveals personality traits and life path.
3. **Cycles and Transits**: Planets, especially their movements and positions, create cycles that affect individuals and collective events.

Occult Art 2: Tarot
Core Principles:
1. **Divination**: Tarot uses a deck of 78 cards with individual symbols and meanings, as a tool for self-reflection, introspection, and divination.
2. **Major and Minor Arcana**: The deck comprises two main groups—Major Arcana (22 cards) symbolizing significant life events or spiritual lessons, and Minor Arcana (56 cards) representing daily experiences and practical concerns.
3. **Archetypes and Symbolism**: Each card embodies specific archetypal energies, symbols, and themes, which offer insights into the querent's (person seeking knowledge) situation or question.

Occult Art 3: Alchemy
Core Principles:
1. **Transformation**: Alchemy seeks to transform base metals into gold, symbolizing spiritual and personal evolution.
2. **Philosophers' Stone**: A magical substance, with power over life and death, believed to grant immortality and heal all illness when ingested as elixir.
3. **Hermeticism**: Deeply rooted in the ancient teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, alchemy adheres to principles of correspondence, polarity, and equilibrium, often encoded in cryptic symbols and allegories.

Relationships, Patterns, and Connections:
While the specific practices differ, these three occult arts share several common themes:
1. All involve a belief in symbolic, non-material interactions between the cosmos and human experience (e.g., astrological influences, Tarot archetypes, and alchemical symbols).
2. Correspondence and interconnectedness are vital to each occult art—whether through the zodiac influencing terrestrial activities, Tarot cards and archetypes evoking unique interpretations, or alchemical transformation reflecting personal growth.
3. Each art encourages self-exploration, spiritual development, and gaining wisdom. Astrology helps unveil our life journey; Tarot deepens personal insight; and Alchemy offers a path to self-betterment, even enlightenment.

Coherent Philosophical Perspective:
From analyzing these arts, a holistic philosophical perspective emerges. It's one that emphasizes interconnectedness, symbol-rich languages, and the quest for inner transformation—ultimately, a cycle of personal growth and understanding through the cosmos' hidden patterns.

In summary, the essence of occult arts such as Astrology, Tarot, and Alchemy lies in their shared belief in cosmic interconnectedness, symbolism, and personal growth. Patterns and connections exist through symbolic languages, correspondence, and hermetic principles. The philosophical perspective that emerges from these arts encourages a deeper understanding of ourselves and the cosmos through inner transformation and the discovery of hidden patterns and connections guiding our lives.
