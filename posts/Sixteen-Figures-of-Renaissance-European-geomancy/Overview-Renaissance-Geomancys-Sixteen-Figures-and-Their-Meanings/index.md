Interpreting Geomantic Figures in Divination

A student of the occult wishing to employ the Sixteen Figures in geomantic divination should begin by familiarizing themselves with each figure's symbolism, elemental association, planetary influence, and zodiac sign. Understanding these connections will enable the practitioner to read the complex interplay between these figures during a divination session.

Start by randomly generating figures through a traditional method, such as drawing lines of dots on a surface and pairing them to create a figure. The subsequent figures, referred to as mothers, will form the basis of your geomantic reading. Combine the mothers to generate new figures, known as daughters and subsequent generations, following traditional geomantic techniques until you have a complete geomantic chart.

In interpreting the figures, consider their positions and roles within the chart. Pay attention to their connections to elements, planets, and zodiac signs for added depth in your reading. Note that some figures may be more prominent, acting as confirmations or carrying more significant weight, while others may be opposing or contradictory. Reconciling these dynamics is crucial in delivering a comprehensive, accurate geomantic divination.

In conclusion, the Sixteen Figures of Renaissance European geomancy constitute an intricate and versatile divination system. Through understanding the symbolism and connections associated with each figure, a student of the occult can master the art of geomantic divination, providing deep insights and guiding them on their spiritual journey.
