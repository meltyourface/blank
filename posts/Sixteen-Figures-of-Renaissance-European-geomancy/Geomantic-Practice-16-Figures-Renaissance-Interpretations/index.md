1. Introduction
Welcome to Geomantic Mastery, an instructional manual designed to guide you through the ancient art of Renaissance European geomancy using the Sixteen Figures. The purpose of this guidebook is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the techniques and role of each figure, the selection and interpretation of Witnesses and the Judge, as well as outlining the different aspects of the Shield, House, and Company Charts. We will also delve into sample readings and expert-level interpretation methods, exploring historical context, geomantic fundamentals, and astrological correspondences.

2. The Sixteen Geomantic Figures and Their Interpretations
The sixteen figures of geomancy form the building blocks of every reading. Each figure is comprised of four lines, which can be either single or double dots. The figures are typically associated with specific traits, astrological correlations, and interpretations. The sixteen figures are:

1. Via (The Way)
2. Cauda Draconis (The Tail of the Dragon)
3. Puer (The Boy)
4. Fortuna Major (The Greater Fortune)
5. Puella (The Girl)
6. Amissio (Loss)
7. Albus (The White)
8. Conjunctio (Conjunction)
9. Tristitia (Sorrow)
10. Carcer (Prison)
11. Acquisitio (Gain)
12. Laetitia (Joy)
13. Rubeus (The Red)
14. Caput Draconis (The Head of the Dragon)
15. Fortuna Minor (The Lesser Fortune)
16. Populus (The People)

3. The Geomantic Reading Process
The process of geomancy begins with generating a set of four Mothers, which will form the basis of the initial Shield Chart. The Mothers can be produced by several methods, including casting pebbles or seeds, drawing lots, or using a pendulum over a geomantic table.

Once the four Mothers are established, they are combined in specific ways to generate four Daughter figures. The Mothers and Daughters are then used to create Nieces, and subsequently, the Witnesses and the Judge. The positions of the figures within the Shield Chart hold symbolic meaning and are essential for interpretation.

4. Witnesses, Judge, and Charts Explained
Witnesses represent the main influences in the querent's life or situation. Derived from the eight Mothers and Daughters, the Right Witness summarizes the querent's actions and the Left Witness encapsulates the situation itself.

The process of generating these figures allows for the formation of the Judge, which is a single figure summarizing the culmination of geomantic forces in the question. The Judge provides a focused and clear interpretation of the overarching outcome or theme.

**Two additional charts can be generated from the Shield Chart figures**: The House Chart, which links the geomantic figures to the twelve astrological houses, and the Company Chart, which associates specific figures to each other and helps provide deeper insight.

5. Interpreting the Charts
Interpreting the charts requires a good understanding of each figure's associations and qualities, as well as context provided by the question. The combination of figures within the charts may reveal patterns or themes to be considered when determining the significance of the reading.

Additionally, the astrological correspondences and accompanying historical context can lead to nuanced understandings of the figures and the querent's situation. Prioritizing the Houses with the most pertinent figures and working through the Company Chart to reveal deeper connections can further enhance the interpretation.

6. Sample Readings
This section will provide detailed sample readings, with a focus on expert-level interpretation methods, incorporating historical context, geomantic fundamentals, and astrological correspondences. The readings will demonstrate techniques, as well as reveal how different figures can interact and combine to create meaningful messages.

7. Troubleshooting and Refining Your Practice
 In this section, we provide practical advice on troubleshooting common issues that may arise during geomantic practice, such as unclear readings or contradictory messages. Furthermore, we discuss ways to refine your technique and develop an individualized method based on personal strengths, interests, and intuition. Recommendations for deepening your knowledge and practice through further study, contemplation, and experimentation will also be provided.
