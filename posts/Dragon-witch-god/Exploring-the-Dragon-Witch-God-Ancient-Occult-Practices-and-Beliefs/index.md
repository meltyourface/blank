The Dragon Witch God, often referred to as the Draconic Deity, is an ancient occult concept stemming from prehistoric spiritual beliefs and practices that have evolved over centuries. The Draconic Deity is believed to be a powerful and wise entity, representative of the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth.
