Task: Dragon Witch God Ritual for Infusing Draconic Energy into the Amulet of the Wyrms

Ritual Preparation:
1. Cleanse the sacred space where the ritual will take place, ensuring it is free from any negative energy or influence.
2. Prepare a circular altar at the center of the space, adorned with the symbols of fire (red candles and rubies) and air (white feathers and clear quartz).
3. Place an ornate silver chalice filled with water and a bowl of earth at the cardinal points of the altar, representing the balancing of the other elemental forces.
4. Draw sacred symbols on the floor around the altar, using a mixture of dragon's blood ink and crushed gemstones to emanate both draconic and mystical energies.

Ritual Procedure:
1. Begin the ritual by lighting the red candles and burning the ethereal incense. Choose an incense that aligns with draconic energy, such as dragon's blood or sandalwood.
2. At twilight, when the sun and moon are both visible, place the Amulet of the Wyrms at the center of the altar.
3. Stand within the circle of sacred symbols, facing the altar, and assume a meditative stance.
4. Recite the ancient chant, invoking the Dragon witch god and beseeching their presence:

"By the fiery breath of Aesthyr, the air that sings through Tyvareth's wings,
I invoke the draconic might, the spirits of the Dragon witch god to bring forth their light.
As the elements meld and weave, to the Amulet of the Wyrms, your power I bequeath."

5. Focus intently on the artifact, envisioning a spiraling torrent of fiery energy and swirling air that begins to engulf the amulet. Feel the heat and the electricity of draconic energy filling the space around you.
6. As you recite the chant, raise your arms to the sky, imagining an immense dragon emerging from the vortical energies, its wings outstretched, and its roaring breath intertwining with the elemental forces.

"Into the sacred talisman cast, the essence of the dragon's breath and mystical past,
Fire and air, bind and entwine, imbue the Amulet with strength divine,
By the soaring skies and burning flame, I seal this power within the Wyrms' name."

7. Lower your hands slowly, directing the dragon's energy into the amulet. Visualize the dragon's breath and spirit being absorbed into the artifact, halos of fire and air encircling the pendant.
8. Once you sense the infusion of power is complete, extinguish the candles and allow the incense to burn out.
9. Thank the Dragon witch god for their presence and assistance:

"Glorious Dragon witch god, I humbly thank thee,
For entrusting your power and spirit to me,
Return now to your realm of flame and air,
Leave this space with our eternal gratitude and care."

10. Carefully pick up the Amulet of the Wyrms, now imbued with the indomitable energy of the dragon entity. Wear it or store it reverently, as it has now become a potent tool of arcane power.

By completing this sacred ritual, you have meticulously infused the Amulet of the Wyrms with the immense power and elemental force of the Dragon witch god, creating a potent artifact that can be wielded with great care and mastery.
