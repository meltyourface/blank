To conduct an in-depth Ogham tree divination ritual following Celtic folk traditions, we will be adhering to the following steps:

1. Preparation: Begin by gathering specific symbols from the Ogham alphabet, which consists of 20 symbols, each representing a different tree. For this in-depth divination, you will need to create a set of Ogham staves or gather objects that symbolize these trees. Carve or paint the Ogham symbols onto the staves or objects.

2. Sacred Grove: Choose an area near a sacred grove of trees, ideally surrounded by a variety of the species represented in the Ogham alphabet. This location should feel spiritually uplifting and connected to the ancient Celtic beliefs.

3. Seasonal Offerings: Integrate seasonal offerings, such as autumnal nuts, fruits, or springtime flowers, that are native to the region and appropriate for the current time of year. Place these offerings at the base of the trees with respect and gratitude, along with a libation like mead or fresh water.

4. Invocation of the Celtic Pantheon: Invoke the relevant gods and goddesses from the Celtic pantheon who are helpful in divination, such as The Dagda, Brigid, Lugh, and Morrigan. Light a small fire, or a candle if open fires are not permitted, to honor these deities and invite their guidance and insight.

5. The Ritual: At dawn, as the sun begins to rise, stand in the sacred grove with your Ogham staves or items. Breathe deeply and clear your mind. Focus on the question or situation for which you seek guidance. Hold the Ogham staves or items in your dominant hand and gently toss them onto a soft, natural surface like grass or moss. Observe which symbols land facing upwards.

6. Interpretation: Take note of the upward-facing symbols and consider their meanings in relation to your situation or question. For example:

- Birch (Beith) often represents new beginnings or a fresh start.
- Oak (Duir) is associated with strength and stability.

Look for connections and patterns between the symbols. Research historical and mythological aspects of the trees and their associations to gain a deeper understanding of the message.

7. Reflection: Take some time to reflect on the insights gained from the divination and how they relate to your query. Consider how you can use this guidance in your life moving forward.

8. Gratitude: Remember to thank the gods and goddesses and the spirits of the trees for their assistance, leaving the sacred grove with an appreciative heart.

By following these steps and combining your knowledge of Ogham symbols, Celtic deities, and folklore, this in-depth tree divination ritual can provide a deeper understanding of your situation and guide you toward wise decisions.
