To create an intricate astrological chart incorporating the Egyptian pantheon, we will assign each major god and goddess a celestial body and zodiac sign, and then integrate their positions and influences into a detailed, visually stunning chart.  

1. Ra, the sun god: Ra embodies the vital force of the sun and represents creation and vitality. Ra is indisputably associated with the Sun itself, and his zodiac sign is the regal and creative Leo. In the chart, Ra will be given prominence, with a depiction of the sun in the center of the chart.

2. Khonsu, the moon god: Khonsu, the god of the moon and time, is naturally associated with the Moon, and his zodiac sign is the nurturing and gentle Cancer. His position on the chart will be depicted with a crescent moon alongside the sun, and his association with time shall be represented by an ornate lunar calendar.

3. Isis, the goddess of fertility and motherhood: Isis, a powerful, nurturing figure, is linked to Venus, the planet of love and beauty. Her zodiac sign is the loving and loyal Taurus. Isis will be represented in the chart by a beautiful woman, holding an ankh signifying eternal life.

4. Osiris, the god of the afterlife: Osiris, lord of the dead, is connected to the underworld and the planet Pluto. His corresponding zodiac sign is the transformational Scorpio. Osiris shall be portrayed holding a crook and flail, symbols of his authority and the rebirth cycle.

5. Anubis, god of mummification and judge of souls: Anubis, as the deity of judgment, is linked to the fair and balance-seeking planet, Jupiter. His zodiac sign is Libra. Anubis will be depicted with a jackal's head and holding the scales of judgment, weighing the heart of the deceased against the feather of Maâ€™at.

Now that we have designated the celestial bodies and zodiac signs for each major Egyptian god, we will examine their positions within the chart and the influence they have on it. For example, if Ra, the sun god, is in the 5th house, it indicates a period of creative and energetic self-expression, whereas Khonsu in Cancer in the 4th house points toward a time of nurturing and emotional growth, particularly within the home and family realms.

Astrological retrogrades and planetary alignments will also be interpreted based on the Egyptian mythology:

- Venus Retrograde: Isis, as the goddess linked to Venus, will have her influence wane during this period, potentially making relationships and emotional connections more difficult, requiring reassessment and healing.

- Jupiter-Pluto Conjunction: The combined energies of Anubis and Osiris during this conjunction may indicate a time of deep, transformative self-discovery and the unearthing of hidden truths.

This intricately-designed Egyptian astrological chart will provide not only visually stunning illustrations of the gods and goddesses alongside their celestial counterparts but also a detailed interpretation of their positions and the mythology behind their influences on our lives based on planetary alignments, retrograde motions, and zodiac houses.
