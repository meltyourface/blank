1. **Historical Context of Hermeticism and Western Terma**

Hermeticism, a spiritual philosophy rooted in the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, emerged during the early centuries CE in the Greco-Roman world. At its core, Hermeticism explores the mysteries of the cosmos, humanity, and the divine. The Hermetica, a collection of treatises ascribed to Hermes, is the main source of Hermetic teachings.

Western Terma refers to the hidden or concealed spiritual teachings and practices that originated in the West. Hermeticism can be seen as an essential aspect of Western Terma, from its emergence in Graeco-Roman societies through to the Middle Ages, and later, the Renaissance.

2. **Key Renaissance Figures and Hermeticism**

The Renaissance witnessed a renewed interest in Hermeticism, fueled by the translation and dissemination of Hermetic manuscripts, particularly the Corpus Hermeticum. Key Renaissance figures, including Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, and Leonardo da Vinci, were deeply influenced by these teachings.

Marsilio Ficino, an Italian philosopher and scholar, translated the Corpus Hermeticum into Latin, making it accessible to the wider intellectual community. His translations fueled the flourishing of Hermetic thought during the Renaissance. Pico della Mirandola, another Italian philosopher, was also deeply influenced by Hermeticism, which was evident in his seminal work, the "Oration on the Dignity of Man."

Leonardo da Vinci, the renowned polymath, is known to have engaged with Hermetic ideas in his artwork, inventions, and philosophical thought. He incorporated Hermetic concepts of microcosm and macrocosm, correspondences, and divine proportion in his oeuvre.

3. **Convergence and Divergence of Hermeticism and Other Esoteric Practices**

During the Renaissance, Hermeticism intersected with various other esoteric and occult practices, such as Neoplatonism, Alchemy, and Kabbalah, fostering an environment of intellectual exchange and cross-pollination. Hermeticism and Neoplatonism shared mutual beliefs, such as the emphasis on the human connection to the divine and the concept of an ineffable, transcendent God. However, they diverged in their approaches, with Neoplatonism focusing more on Platonic philosophy and hierarchy-based metaphysics.

Alchemy, which sought the transmutation of base metals into gold and the discovery of the elixir of life, shared some key principles with Hermeticism, such as the correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm. Meanwhile, Kabbalah, a Jewish mystical tradition, intersected with Hermeticism in their shared focus on divine emanations and cosmic correspondences.

4. Impact of Hermeticism on Renaissance Art, Architecture, and Literature

Hermetic concepts significantly influenced various aspects of Renaissance art, architecture, literature, and scientific development. Artists, architects, and writers incorporated Hermetic symbolism and principles into their works. For instance, Art often depicted allegorical representations of Hermes Trismegistus and alchemical processes, while architecture embraced the principle of divine geometry, incorporating harmonious ratios and proportions.

In literature, Hermetic themes surfaced in works by writers such as Dante Alighieri and William Shakespeare, while scientific inquiry was notably influenced by figures like Johannes Kepler and Robert Fludd, who turned to Hermeticism for cosmic and metaphysical insights.

5. **Lasting Legacy and Modern Relevance of Hermeticism and Western Terma**

The legacy of Hermeticism continues to resonate within contemporary esoteric and occult practices, such as ceremonial magic, Jungian psychology, and various New Age currents. Western Terma, as a repository of hidden wisdom, allows for the continued exploration and reinterpretation of Hermetic teachings, whose relevance endures even as society and culture transform.

In conclusion, the exploration of Hermeticism and its intersection with Western Terma during the Renaissance demonstrates the rich complexity and enduring significance of these esoteric traditions. From influential Renaissance figures to the impact on various art forms and intellectual pursuits, Hermeticism's fingerprint on history is indelible, and its continued resonance bears testament to the timeless nature of its teachings.
