In the twilight hour, with shadows cast,
As the veil thins and worlds unite,
I stand before the great divide,
And summon thee, ancient psychopomp,
To guide these fallen souls through the night.

Radiant Módraniht, keeper of the path,
Through echoing whispers, I invoke thy name,
Awaken now, the spectral shadows part,
And heed my call, ethereal flame.

By the sacred names of everlasting power,
Otharos, Nigrum, and Elothain,
I trace their symbols, let the sigils tower,
To pierce the veil, let thy guidance reign.

With rod, in hand, the first attribute,
To guide thy flock through hidden realms,
With balance, order, firm and resolute,
Steer the course, navigate unseen helms.

The second facet, soothing voice of solace,
Whispering words to lost souls so dear,
O'er troubled waters, ever boundless,
Alleviate the burdens, lift their fear.

Power of transformation marks the third,
To bring forth change to those who've passed,
Shifting form, transcending mortal word,
In thee, all mortal shapes outlast.

As I chant the rhythm, cadence measured
(Tap tap *clap*, tap tap *clap*)
Elements align, incantation treasured,
(Tap tap *clap*, tap tap *clap*)
Pounding hearts and resounding feet,
(Tap tap *clap*, tap tap *clap*)
In harmonious dance, our spirits meet.
(Tap tap *clap*, tap tap *clap*)

In sacred circle drawn, an orb of fire,
I step within, this threshold marked,
Lifting arms in reverent desire,
From ancient dust, our bond, it sparks.

Oh, Radiant Módraniht, arise and take your place,
As guide and shepherd, may you soar,
With loving heart, and solemn grace,
Lead the souls to evermore.

**Recite this chant three times at the sacred hour of twilight, while standing in a circle drawn with salt upon the ground. Perform the rhythmic claps and simultaneous foot taps as detailed. Keep the intent of summoning a psychopomp to guide the deceased strong in your mind throughout the ritual. Once completed, the ancient psychopomp will answer the call, and with their divine power, guide the fallen souls to their rightful place among the stars and realms unknown.**
