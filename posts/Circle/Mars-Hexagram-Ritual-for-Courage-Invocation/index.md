To conduct the elaborate hexagram ritual within the sacred Circle, meticulously invoking the powerful energies of a distinct planetary force, follow these steps:

1. For the purposes of this description, we will invoke the energies of Mars for courage. Gather symbols and items related to Mars, such as the sigil of Mars, an iron sword, and a red cloth.

2. Craft a customized sigil that embodies courage, taking into account the attributes of Mars and your intentions. Visualize a courageous version of your core being, and create a sigil that encapsulates this vision.

3. Choose a day and time that aligns with Mars' planetary hours and astrological correspondences. Ideally, opt for Tuesday, which is associated with Mars, and begin your ritual during the Mars hour (consult a planetary hours calculator for the exact time).

4. Select an appropriate location, preferably outdoors or within a consecrated space, such as a secluded forest or a dedicated ritual room. The surroundings should reinforce your connection to Mars, invoking courage and strength.

5. While performing the hexagram ritual, incorporate specific planetary incense (such as dragon's blood incense), candles (red candles), and crystals (red jasper or hematite). These elements will heighten the vibrational connection to Mars.

6. Focus your intentions on courage as you draw the hexagram, visualizing the hexagram as a conduit for the energies of Mars. Close your eyes and concentrate on your desired outcome, envisioning the potent influence of Mars infusing you with courage.

7. After completing the hexagram ritual, slowly close the sacred Circle, sealing the power and energy generated within. Express gratitude to Mars for its presence and assistance, and release the invoked force as you extinguish the candles and share a silent moment of gratitude. Trust that the connection established during the hexagram ritual will manifest courage in your life in the following days.
