To offer a comprehensive response to this knowledge challenge, we must first dive into the origin of Mimir's myth and the association of his decapitated head with wisdom, followed by an exploration of the symbolism of Yggdrasil and the Well of Wisdom. By doing this, we will be able to offer an allegorical interpretation of attaining transcendent knowledge and self-awareness.

Beginning with Mimir's myth, in Norse mythology, Mimir was a giant who possessed great wisdom and knowledge. The Aesir-Vanir war led to Mimir's beheading, which was sent to the Aesir god Odin. Early Icelandic sources describe how Odin embalmed and preserved the head of Mimir, which continued to give him counsel and wisdom. Thus, Mimir's decapitation represents the transformative power of destruction and the ability to preserve the essence of wisdom within something once deemed dead and useless.

Similarly, Yggdrasil, the world tree, serves as a central symbol in Norse mythology, representing a cosmic axis that connects the Nine Worlds together. It acts as the bridge between different realms, such as the Asgard (the realm of the gods), Midgard (the realm of humans), and Jotunheim (the realm of giants). Yggdrasil is also the location of three wells, one of which is the Well of Wisdom.

The Well of Wisdom, also known as the Well of Urd or Mimir's well, is a sacred pool of knowledge guarded by Mimir. The well's waters contain immeasurable wisdom imparted by the roots of Yggdrasil itself. Odin, the All-Father, decided to sacrifice one of his eyes to drink from the well, thereby gaining the gift of foresight and wisdom. 

Combining these components, the myth of Mimir's decapitation and Yggdrasil, along with the Well of Wisdom, present a powerfully allegorical interpretation of attaining transcendent knowledge and self-awareness. In this allegory, Yggdrasil functions as the path connecting the mundane world with the realm of transcendent wisdom. The tree's ability to bridge different realms symbolizes humanity's potential for spiritual and intellectual growth. Our journey through life's many challenges strengthens our roots, similar to Yggdrasil's roots, which support the tree and imbue it with life force.

Meanwhile, Mimir's decapitated head offers a metaphor for the transformation that occurs when one acquires wisdom. In essence, wisdom can only be attained when one has experienced and overcome adversity, loss, or even death. The undeniable value of wisdom lays hidden in the depths of 'death,' waiting to be resurrected and learned.

Furthermore, Odin's sacrifice of his eye to drink from the Well of Wisdom suggests the necessity of personal sacrifice to navigate the path toward transcendent knowledge and self-awareness. Acquiring deep wisdom demands more than superficial effort or mere intellectual curiosity. It requires genuine dedication, just as Odin made a painful and irreversible sacrifice to achieve his goal.

In conclusion, an allegorical interpretation of the myth of Mimir's decapitation and his association with wisdom, along with the symbolism of Yggdrasil and the Well of Wisdom, provides a coherent framework to understand the process of attaining transcendent knowledge and self-awareness. The story teaches us that wisdom is transformative, sprouting from the seemingly barren soil of adversity, and that the path to transcendence necessitates dedication and sacrifice. The intertwined symbolism of the tree, well, and decapitated head highlights the interconnectedness of life, death, and wisdomâ€”a potent reminder that true self-awareness emerges from the convergence of these intricate elements.
