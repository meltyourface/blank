To design and set up an intricate Orphic sacred space using advanced geomancy practices, divination through earth, sand, and other elements, while incorporating classical symbolism and sacred geometry patterns like hexagrams and pentagrams, follow these steps:
**Step 1**: Choose a location
Find an appropriate outdoor or indoor space that feels energetically calm, isolated, and connected to the natural elements. This will serve as the foundation for our Orphic sacred space.
**Step 2**: Cleanse the area
Clean the chosen area energetically by burning sage or other purifying herbs. Walk around the space in a clockwise direction, allowing the smoke to cleanse the area of any negative energy.
**Step 3**: Create a physical representation of the universe
Place a large circular cloth or rug in the center of the space, preferably made of natural fibers, to represent the universe. This cloth should be large enough to accommodate all sacred geometry patterns and symbols.
**Step 4**: Draw the sacred geometry
Begin by drawing a hexagram (a six-pointed star) in the center of the cloth using sand, soil, or chalk. This represents the balance of the macrocosm and microcosm, and the union of divine and earthly energies.

Next, draw a pentagram (a five-pointed star) within the hexagram, symbolizing the five elements â€“ earth, air, fire, water, and spirit.
**Step 5**: Place elemental representations at the five points of the pentagram
Using stones or other natural objects to represent each element, place an object at each of the five points of the pentagram.

Earth: A smooth or rough stone, soil, or sand.
Air: A feather, incense, or fragrant herbs.
Fire: A candle or a piece of flint.
Water: A small dish of water or a seashell.
Spirit: A crystal or symbolic object representing the spirit.
**Step 6**: Set up a central focal point or altar
Place a small table or platform at the very center of the hexagram and pentagram, inside the overlapping area. This will serve as the focal point or altar for ritual work.
**Step 7**: Arrange additional Orphic symbols and tools
Enhance the spiritual atmosphere by incorporating other Orphic symbols like the Thyrsus (a staff with a pinecone), the Egg, and the Serpent. Place these symbols alongside objects commonly used in Orphic rituals (e.g., chalices, knives, ritual instruments) to further amplify the occult energies.
**Step 8**: Invoke the elements and energies
Begin your practice by invoking the elements and cosmic forces in the sacred space. Stand in the center of the sacred geometry, facing the east, and call upon the elemental energies and spirits associated with the Orphic tradition.
**Step 9**: Perform the intended ritual or work
Now that the intricate Orphic sacred space is set up and the energies have been invoked, perform the desired ritual or spiritual work. This may include spellwork, divination, astral travel, or communion with deities or ancestors. The efficient communion of earthly and divine energies in this sacred space grants an auspicious and powerful setting for your magickal endeavors.

Remember that the sacred space, as well as the practice itself, should be approached with respect and reverence. When finished, express gratitude to the spirits, deities, and elements involved in your practice, and close the ritual by properly disassembling the sacred space.
