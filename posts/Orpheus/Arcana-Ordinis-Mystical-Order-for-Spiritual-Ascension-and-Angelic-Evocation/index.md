excerpt: Design and establish a novel mystical organization rooted in the arcane wisdom of medieval grimoires, with emphasis on the intricate practices and overlooked lore. Outline the order's doctrines, initiation rites, and esoteric rituals, drawing inspiration from specific grimoire texts such as the Lesser Key of Solomon, the Picatrix, and the Book of Abramelin the Mage. Incorporate elements of theurgy, angelic evocation, and complex summoning circles to enrich the order's mystical practices, and develop a comprehensive hierarchy of adepts, from beginners to seasoned masters. Additionally, plan for the integration of contemporary occult knowledge while preserving the essence of ancient magical techniques, ensuring the order evolves with time without losing its core principles.
