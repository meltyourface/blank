To answer this knowledge challenge thoroughly, let us first establish the foundational understanding of the key concepts mentioned: Consciousness of TimeFuturoscope, Time, Synchronicity, and Chronomancy. 

Consciousness of TimeFuturoscope refers to the experience, exploration, and manipulation of time as a continuum, taking into account the interconnectedness of events across the past, present, and future. This concept deals with the idea that divisions of time are inherently fluid and can influence one another. 

Time, as an esoteric principle, is commonly understood as an illusion or a variable construct rather than a linear, quantifiable measurement. In the framework of occult studies, time has been described as cyclical, allowing for the potential repetition of events and the reappearance of archetypal patterns in the collective unconscious. This perspective on time often correlates with the concept of eternal recurrence.

Synchronicity is a term coined by Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychologist, and it refers to the seemingly unrelated events that hold a deeper, symbolic meaning when considered in conjunction with each other. Synchronicities are often perceived as manifestations of an underlying pattern or 'fabric' of reality, manifesting through apparent coincidences. Synchronicity transcends time and space, suggesting that events do not occur purely due to causality but can be connected meaningfully in non-linear ways.

Chronomancy is the occult practice of divination by means of time, focusing on predicting future events and deciphering how past and present events influence future occurrences. It stems from ancient practices rooted in various world cultures and utilizes techniques that focus on time symbolism, patterns, and cycles to gain insight into these connections.

Now that we have established a baseline understanding of these principles, let's delve into their interrelatedness and examine how Consciousness of TimeFuturoscope correlates with Time, Synchronicity, and Chronomancy to reveal the interconnectedness of past, present, and future events.

1. **Fluidity of Time**: Consciousness of TimeFuturoscope suggests that time is a fluid and continuous construct, emphasizing the interconnectedness of events throughout time. This concept aligns with esoteric views on time as a cyclical and illusory phenomenon, rather than a strict, linear progression. The understanding and integration of these concepts enable practitioners to manipulate their perception and unlock the potential of time-related magic.

2. **Synchronicity and Patterns**: The recognition of synchronicities is a crucial aspect of the Consciousness of TimeFuturoscope, as it seeks to reveal the hidden connections between events across time. Appreciating synchronicities as meaningful 'coincidences' helps illuminate the rich tapestry of experience woven throughout the past, present, and future, providing a holistic view of existence.

3. **Divination and Prediction**: Chronomancy is an essential component of the Consciousness of TimeFuturoscope. The divination of future events by examining patterns and cycles allows the practitioner to gain a better understanding of the intricate balance between past, present, and future. This knowledge can empower the individual to make informed decisions and align themselves with the natural ebb and flow of existence.

In conclusion, the occult concept of Consciousness of TimeFuturoscope correlates with the esoteric principles of Time, Synchronicity, and Chronomancy by offering a comprehensive view of the interconnectedness of past, present, and future events. By recognizing time as fluid and cyclical, identifying synchronistic patterns, and utilizing divination techniques that tap into this knowledge, practitioners can gain deep insights and understanding of the complex, multi-dimensional nature of reality. This interconnectedness ultimately empowers individuals to navigate the temporal realms, shedding light on the hidden connections that bind our experiences together across time.
