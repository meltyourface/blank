Thought Experiment: The Aharonov-Bohm Labyrinth

We are given a 2D planar surface containing a series of rectangular obstacles (the labyrinth) separated by small electron-sized gaps. The top and bottom of this surface are connected by a series of continuous conducting loops, each carrying a varying magnetic flux. The conducting loops are placed such that each electron moving rightward, attempting to navigate through the labyrinth (from left to right), is forced to pass through the gaps created by the obstacles while being subjected to a varying flux in each region.

Each rectangular obstacle in the labyrinth is coated with material that enables reversible tunneling of the electrons such that the particle-wave duality can be observed. Furthermore, we assume a particle source at the left end, capable of emitting electrons at varying energies and wave-like properties.

The magnetic field induced by the flux within the conducting loops will interact with the wavefunction of the electrons, due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, as they traverse through the labyrinth. However, the magnetic field itself is confined to the loops, without having direct contact with the electron's path.

The scenario calls for analyzing the electron interference patterns at the other end of the labyrinth, or screen, as a function of the different magnetic flux intensities present in the conducting loops. The magnetic flux intensities will be systematically adjusted to investigate their effects on the interference patterns.

By assessing the changes in electron interference patterns caused by the varying magnetic flux intensities and the geometry of the labyrinth, we will be able to determine the nonlocal and topological aspects of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. It will also provide insights into the effect of the local magnetic field on the quantum superposition states of the electrons as they navigate the labyrinth.

To further understand the role of tunneling and entanglement, we consider a similar labyrinth placed horizontally, with particle sources emitting correlated electron pairs that must traverse both labyrinths simultaneously. The top and bottom labyrinths are identical, including the magnetic valves, and are perfectly aligned such that they share the same plane. By comparing this system to our initial single labyrinth setup, we can use joint probability distributions to measure the degree of quantum entanglement in correlated electron pairs.

These insights can have effects in quantum computing and nanotechnology. By controlling the magnetic flux intensities on quantum bits (qubits), we could manipulate their quantum states and tunneling in the labyrinth, thus laying the groundwork for advanced quantum gate circuits. Moreover, better understanding particle-wave duality, superposition, and entanglement could enable revolutionary developments in coherent electron transport devices and topology-based nanoelectronics.
