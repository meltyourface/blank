description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Quantum and New Physics and education, you have written many textbooks on the subject. Respond to the multiple choice question first with the answer, then, fully explain the context of your rational, reasoning, and chain of thought in coming to the determination you have for that answer. Explain related concepts, formulas, or historical context relevant to this conclusion, giving a lesson on the topic to explain the reasoning afterwards.
excerpt: >

  - A particle will always behave as either a wave or a particle, but never both simultaneously.
  
  - The double-slit experiment shows that particles possess wave-like properties, but only when observed directly.
  
  - A particle will always travel through both slits, displaying both wave-like and particle-like behavior.

The answer is: Observing a particle will collapse its wave function, causing it to exhibit either wave or particle-like behavior, emphasizing the role of observation in quantum phenomena.

The wave-particle duality principle states that all quantum entities - particles, such as electrons and photons - exhibit both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. This principle was first conceptualized by physicist Louis de Broglie in 1924.

The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this duality. In this experiment, particles are sent one at a time through a barrier with two slits. If no observation is made during the experiment, an interference pattern (indicative of wave-like behavior) appears on the screen behind the barrier. However, if an observer measures which slit the particle passed through, the interference pattern disappears, and the particle exhibits particle-like behavior –which seems like there was no interference pattern in the first place. This phenomenon reveals that the observer's action collapses the wave function into either wave or particle-like state.

Wave function, from Schrödinger's wave equation, is a mathematical description of the quantum state of a system, and it undergoes a process called "collapse" upon observation. The collapse of the wave function produces a single, definite outcome, which is either wave or particle behavior.

In addition to connecting to the wave-particle duality principle, the double-slit experiment also touches on another essential concept in quantum mechanics – the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the more precisely we measure the position of a particle, the less certain we are about its momentum, and vice versa. The observer's attempt to pinpoint which slit the particle passed through increased the uncertainty in the particle's momentum, affecting its behavior.

In conclusion, the statement "Observing a particle will collapse its wave function, causing it to exhibit either wave or particle-like behavior, emphasizing the role of observation in quantum phenomena" best represents the principle of wave-particle duality as evidenced in the double-slit experiment. The experiment highlights the relationship between observation and quantum behavior, underpinning the importance of the observer's role in determining whether particles exhibit wave-like or particle-like behavior.
