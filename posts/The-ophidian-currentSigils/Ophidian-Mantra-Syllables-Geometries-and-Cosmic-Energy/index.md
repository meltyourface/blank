It amplifies the user's spiritual receptiveness to receive insight from the Ophidian Spirits.

E'ren'ou - (Pronounced: Eh-ren-oh) This final syllable solidifies the bond with the Ophidian Spirits and completes the connection between the practitioner and these revered entities. It harmonizes the user's energy with the tonal frequencies specific to the Ophidian Spirits, allowing for an effective transference of their cryptic language and wisdom.
