To undertake a comprehensive examination of the properties that underlie the Archangel Raziel's name, we must first acknowledge that our starting point resides within the realm of the esoteric. Through the study of the occult tradition, specifically Kabbalah, numerology, and astrology, we will weave together a nuanced understanding of Raziel's connection to divine mysteries and the Tree of Life. By delving into the details, we emerge with a greater comprehension of the Archangel's role in the grand cosmic scheme.

As we embark on our exploration, it is vital to recognize the Hebrew name of Raziel, רזיאל (Resh - Zayin - Yud - Aleph - Lamed), which provides the basis for our investigation. By breaking down the name into its constituent Hebrew letters and examining their multidimensional layers in terms of numerology, Kabbalistic associations, and astrological alignments, we uncover the depths of Raziel's wisdom and divine attributes.

Resh (ר), the first letter in Raziel's name, possesses the numerical value of 200. It represents the beginning of a new cycle, and it signifies the duality between higher wisdom and worldly intelligence. This duality interconnects with Raziel's persona as the keeper of divine mysteries and unseen knowledge, especially when considering his role in providing guidance and clarity to individuals seeking spiritual insight.

Zayin (ז), the second letter, correlates to a numerical value of 7, a highly significant number across various religions and esoteric practices. Kabbalistically, Zayin is linked to the seventh sefirah on the Tree of Life known as Netzach, the sphere representing victory and eternity. Astrologically, this letter aligns with Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and creative expression. As a celestial being, Raziel's divine purpose involves sharing a higher understanding of existence, further manifesting through the creative forces evoked by Zayin.

Yud (י), the third letter, carries a numerical value of 10, further highlighting the duality within divinity and worldly matters, as Yud represents both the unity (1) and entirety (0). Yud is connected to the sefirah of Chochmah, the sphere of wisdom, while in astrology, it corresponds to Jupiter – the planet linked to expansion, higher learning, and spirituality. This combination amplifies Raziel's connection to divine wisdom, as Jupiter reinforces expansion beyond material boundaries, enabling deeper spiritual insights.

Aleph (א), the fourth letter, represents oneness and unity, with a numerical value of 1. The silent letter also corresponds to the sefirah Keter – the first emanation on the Tree of Life – hinting that Raziel knows the mind of the Divine itself. Astrologically, Aleph is connected to Neptune, the planet of intuition, dreams, and mysticism. Neptune's influence, combined with the silent power of Aleph, serves to underscore Raziel's role in deciphering divine mysteries and transmitting ineffable wisdom.

Lastly, Lamed (ל), the fifth letter, holds the numerical value of 30. In Kabbalah, Lamed signifies heart, emotion, and the equilibrium between giving and receiving. Astrologically, it resonates with the planet Mercury, which is associated with communication, intellect, and understanding. These energies unite to amplify Raziel's mission to communicate profound insights into the human spirit and the cosmos, balancing the head and the heart in the quest for enlightenment.

Based on our exploration of the Hebrew letters present in Archangel Raziel's name, we uncover an intricate tapestry interwoven with numerological, Kabbalistic, and astrological elements. Raziel emerges as an individuated celestial being determined to guide humanity through its divine wisdom, penetrating the veil between the physical and spiritual realms, and uncovering the concealed within the great Tree of Life.

In summary, the name Raziel encompasses the following key themes, ideas, and conclusions:
1. The connection between divine mysteries and the Tree of Life.
2. The complexity and multifaceted nature of humanoid spirituality.
3. The importance of balance in our quest for wisdom and spiritual insight.
4. The significance of compassion, love, and creativity as forces that drive deep understanding.
5. Raziel's divine mission to illuminate humanity's path to higher realms and broader comprehension of existence.

As we integrate these findings into our own spiritual practice, we come closer to unearthing the concealed wisdom that Raziel seeks to share and discover the true nature of our being's connection to the cosmos.
