In the context of Kabbalah, the name of the archangel who serves as the divine manifestation of wisdom is Raziel, and the corresponding Sephirah is Chokmah.

The Kabbalistic Tree of Life consists of ten Sephirot, each representing distinct yet interconnected aspects of God. Chokmah, which translates to "wisdom," is the second Sephirah on the Tree of Life, representing the first step of creation, where divine wisdom emanates from the first Sephirah, Keter (crown). As the archangel associated with Chokmah, Raziel is responsible for revealing the secrets of the divine, which are encoded within creation.

Attributes of Raziel and Influences on Personal Development:

1. Keeper of Divine Wisdom: Raziel is believed to possess all the knowledge of the universe. He is considered the personification of divine wisdom, and thus he can provide an initiate with unparalleled understanding and insights into the spiritual realm. Individuals seeking spiritual growth can draw upon Raziel's wisdom to cultivate their awareness of the divine and unlock the mysteries of existence.

2. Connection to Hermeticism: Hermeticism, an ancient philosophical and religious tradition derived from the teachings of Thoth (Hermes Trismegistus), highlights principles such as the interconnectedness of all things and the power of the mind to influence reality. Raziel, by being a source of divine wisdom, can provide an initiate with knowledge that aligns with Hermetic teachings, helping them understand the interconnectedness of the spiritual and physical worlds and the concepts of 'As above, so below' and 'As within, so without' more deeply.

3. Relationship to Gnosticism: Gnosticism is a tradition which emphasizes the individual pursuit of knowledge as the path to spiritual ascent. Raziel, in his role as guardian and revealer of divine secrets, can aid initiates in their Gnostic journey by offering them access to otherwise obscure spiritual truths, leading to self-realization and a more profound understanding of the divine.

4. The Book of Raziel: According to legend, Raziel authored a sacred text known as the "Sefer Raziel HaMalakh," which contains fundamental wisdom on the nature of reality, including the interrelations between the Sephirot on the Tree of Life and the understanding of the divine in all creation. Studying this book and applying its teachings can further empower an initiate on their spiritual journey, allowing them to deepen their connection to the divine and the world around them.

In conclusion, Raziel is the archangel associated with Chokmah, the second Sephirah on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and serves as the divine manifestation of wisdom. Through his attributes and connections to various mystical systems such as Hermeticism and Gnosticism, Raziel can significantly influence the personal development of an individual seeking spiritual growth. By calling upon Raziel's wisdom, studying the principles of these mystical traditions, and employing the teachings of the Book of Raziel, an initiate can unlock hidden knowledge and cultivate a deeper understanding of the divine, ultimately leading to profound spiritual development.
