Metatron, also known as "the Chancellor of Heaven" and "the Prince of the Angels," is an archangel found in various religious texts, grimoires, and esoteric literature. Although Metatron is not directly mentioned in the canonical texts of the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament, this angelic figure has a significant presence in other Jewish writings, Christian apocrypha, and Islamic texts. The figure of Metatron has evolved throughout history, in both role and significance, adapting to the spiritual cultures and religious beliefs of various societies. 

Historical sources surrounding Metatron:
1. Merkabah Mysticism (Jewish): Hekhalot and Merkabah texts, such as Hekhalot Rabbati and 3 Enoch, are among the earliest sources referencing Metatron. In these texts, Metatron is portrayed as the celestial scribe, recording the deeds of humanity and maintaining the divine order. The Merkabah tradition is also the origin of Metatron's famous title, "The Lesser YHWH."
2. Kabbalistic (Jewish): In Kabbalistic literature, such as the Zohar and the Sefer Yetzirah, Metatron is considered the highest of the archangels and serves as a divine mediator between the physical world and the divine realm, especially with Ein Sof, the infinite source of creation. Metatron is also identified with the sefirah Keter, representing the highest level of divine emanation.
3. Apocryphal Christian Writings: The angel is mentioned in various early Christian apocryphal texts such as the Testament of Adam and the Ascension of Isaiah. In these texts, Metatron plays different roles - often as a celestial chancellor or divine guide, responsible for showing souls their way in the heavenly domain.
4. Islamic Esoteric Literature: In Sufi and Shia esoteric writings, Metatron is identified with the angelic figure of Idris, a prophet in Islamic tradition, who was assumed into heaven by God and assumed an angelic position. Metatron, in this context, is closely connected to the concept of divine light and knowledge.

Discrepancies and unique interpretations of Metatron:
- One significant discrepancy in the various interpretations of Metatron is the nature of the angel's origins. While some sources echo a notion that Metatron was once the biblical figure Enoch, who was transformed into an angel, others reject this interpretation and consider Metatron a unique and exclusive angelic entity.
- The connection between Metatron and the Shekhinah (divine feminine presence) in Kabbalistic writings is another point of variance. Some interpretations view Metatron as the male counterpart to Shekhinah, while others see the angel as a distinct and separate being without direct gender association.

Artworks and texts depicting Metatron:
- The Book of Enoch, particularly the Third Book of Enoch, includes detailed descriptions of Metatron and the angel's roles and responsibilities in the divine order.
- The Iconography of Jewish Art (by Gabrielle Sed-Rajna) contains imagery of Metatron, often represented with multiple faces and large wings, signifying the angel's multi-dimensional presence and capabilities. The depiction emphasizes Metatron's all-seeing nature and extensive influence in the heavenly domain.
- Metatron is also a prominent figure in the artistic tradition of the Tree of Life, often depicted as residing within the highest sefirah, Keter, representing the union of divine wisdom and knowledge. Examples of such artworks can be found in various Kabbalistic manuscripts and depictions of the sefirot throughout history.

In conclusion, the figure of Metatron is a complex and highly influential angel throughout history, with roles ranging from celestial scribe, divine mediator, to the highest archangel. Metatronâ€™s significance, symbolism, and discrepancies in interpretation reflect the rich tapestry of human spirituality and religious beliefs across different cultures and time periods.
