Answering the knowledge challenge requires understanding the foundations of the esoteric concepts of Kabbalah, numerology, and angelic hierarchies. With that established, we can progress to discuss how these ideas relate to one another, deduce the angel's name and respective position, and lastly, explore its significance in human spiritual advancement.

Kabbalah, originating from Jewish mysticism, is a system that aims to decode the enigmatic nature of the universe and its divine creation. It primarily focuses on the Tree of Life, a symbolic arrangement of ten spheres or sephirot, which represent the ten attributes or emanations through which God interacts with the world.

Numerology is another esoteric practice involving a belief in the mystical association between numbers and physical or spiritual qualities. It focuses on the vibrational energy of numbers and letters, aiding in understanding the divine essence and symbolism.

Lastly, angelic hierarchies refer to the order of angels in religious traditions, primarily Christianity. These hierarchies are often divided into three levels, each containing three choirs or orders, totaling nine angelic orders.

To deduce the angel's name and respective position, we need to identify the attribute on the Tree of Life associated with the balanced unity of intellect and intuition. Examining the sephirot, we find 'Da'at,' which translates to 'Knowledge,' embodying an equilibrium between intellect (associated with 'Chokhmah', or Wisdom) and intuition (connected to 'Binah', or Understanding).

In numerology, each letter in the Hebrew alphabet carries a numerical value. To find the numerical value associated with 'Da'at,' we consider its Hebrew spelling: דעת. The sum of these letters, when assigned their respective numerical values, is 474 (Dalet = 4, Ayin = 70, Tav = 400). 

Linking Kabbalistic concepts with angelic hierarchies, we can explore the correspondences between the emanations of the Tree of Life and the nine orders. In this instance, we find Da'at associated with the order of angels called 'Ishim', who mediate divine knowledge to humanity.

Given the numerological value of Da'at (474) and the correspondence to the order of Ishim, we can deduce the angel's name to be Raziel. Raziel, often meaning "Secret of God," holds a respective position as the archangel within the order of Ishim. Raziel is associated with sacred knowledge, wisdom, and divine mysteries, overseeing the balance between intellect and intuition.

The significance of Raziel in human spiritual advancement is profound. Known as the keeper of divine secrets, Raziel grants access to divine wisdom and esoteric knowledge, guiding humanity on their spiritual journey. As the embodiment of balanced intellect and intuition, Raziel encourages spiritual growth, self-awareness, and discernment of higher truths.

In conclusion, by incorporating the esoteric concepts of Kabbalah, numerology, and angelic hierarchies, we deduced the angel as Raziel, whose divine emanations manifest as the balanced unity of intellect and intuition. Raziel's name and position signify the importance of divine wisdom and spiritual enlightenment in human advancement. As one seeks to develop spiritually, cultivating a balance between intellect and intuition under Raziel's guidance can accelerate progress, leading to profound understanding and transformative growth.
