The answer to this question is:

- Metatron is primarily linked to the concept of divine wisdom and is said to assist in guiding seekers on their spiritual journeys.

Metatron occupies an essential position within esoteric, occult, and angelic lore. As an angel, Metatron is best known for its representation of divine wisdom, protection, and guidance. Esoteric traditions position Metatron as the celestial scribe and the right-hand angel of God. It is said to help individuals along their spiritual paths, providing them with knowledge and bridging the gap between the earthly and the divine realms.

The basis for Metatron's association with wisdom and guidance comes from Jewish Mysticism, primarily the Kabbalistic tradition. In Kabbalah, Metatron is associated with the highest Sephirah, or emanation of God, called Keter (meaning “crown” in Hebrew). This Sephirah represents the most direct and pure connection to the infinite divine source, as well as divine wisdom and comprehension.

Several ancient texts and apocryphal works reference Metatron. For example, in the Jewish Talmud, Metatron is described as the "Lesser YHWH," illustrating its significant standing within the heavenly hierarchy, second only to God. In the Book of Enoch, Metatron is described as the angel who led the prophet Enoch on a celestial journey through the heavens and ultimately transformed him into the angelic figure we now know as Metatron.

Metatron also plays a prominent role in the teachings of Merkabah mysticism. Merkabah, meaning "chariot," refers to the process of spiritually ascending to the divine realm. As a celestial guide, Metatron is thought to lead the worthy through the difficult process of reaching the divine consciousness, effectively guiding them on their spiritual journey.

Given the broad and connected features of esoteric, occult, and angel teachings, Metatron's association with divine wisdom has also found its way into various spiritual practices. In modern times, Metatron is often employed in meditation or invoked for guidance when making critical decisions and striving for inner growth. The ultimate goal, for many, is attaining a higher state of spiritual enlightenment by connecting with the divine wisdom embodied by Metatron.

In conclusion, Metatron's primary role across esoteric and occult traditions is that of a divine teacher and guide. As an embodiment of divine wisdom, Metatron seeks to assist those traversing their spiritual paths and strives to bridge the gap between the earthly and the divine realms. By understanding the role that Metatron plays, individuals can learn to navigate their spiritual journeys with greater clarity and insight.
