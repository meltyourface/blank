They are tasked with the guardianship of God's throne, as well as the transmission of divine wisdom and knowledge.

Each Seraph is entrusted with specific powers and duties that can be associated with the elemental forces of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, which hold great symbolic and metaphysical significance. We can explore these relationships further by examining some of the well-known Seraphs and their connections to these elements.
