## I. Preparations for the ritual:

1. Obtain the following ceremonial tools and offerings:
   - A brass chalice filled with dark red wine
   - Dragon's blood incense
   - A charcoal burner and charcoal tablets
   - Black and purple candles
   - A ceremonial dagger (athame)
   - A wand made from hazel or ebony wood
   - A brass incense burner in the shape of a lion
   - A bell with an engraved sigil of Valefor on the surface

2. Acquire a copy of Valefor's sigil from the Goetia.

3. Select a private, undisturbed location for the ritual that has enough space to draw a protective circle with a 9-foot diameter.
 
4. Cleanse and consecrate the area, using sage or holy water to purify the space.

5. Meditate and fast for one day prior to the ritual to heighten your focus and spiritual energy.


### II. Strengthening your personal willpower and energy:

1. Practice daily meditation, visualize a bright white light growing around you, enveloping and protecting you from unwanted influences.

2. Adopt breath control exercises to calm your anxieties and manage your emotional state during the ritual.

3. Develop a mantra that affirms your personal strength, such as "I am powerful and capable, with the forces of the universe supporting me."


### III. Creating a protective circle:

1. Outline a circle on the ground large enough to accommodate you comfortably, using white chalk or salt.

2. Mark the four cardinal directions with black and purple candles.

3. Place the incense burner containing the Dragon's blood incense at the Northeast corner of the circle.

4. Inside the circle, place the wine-filled chalice, the ceremonial dagger, the wand, and Valefor's sigil in front of you.

5. Place the bell with Valefor (inscribed with his sigil) at the center of the circle.

6. Visualize a sphere of protective white light surrounding the circle, safeguarding your space from unwanted entities and energies.


### IV. Invocation of Valefor:

1. Begin by lighting the black and purple candles and the Dragon's Blood incense, then inhale deeply to connect to the energies present.

2. Stand within the protective circle and face west, as Valefor is designated as the 6th spirit of the Goetia, corresponding to the elemental realm of water.

3. Sound the bell three times to signal the commencement of the ritual.

4. Hold the wand and trace Valefor's sigil in the air while reciting the following incantation:

    "Valefor, duke of the shadows, master of thievery and hidden secrets,
     I call upon you with respect and unwavering determination.
     Hear my voice and know that I seek your presence in this sacred circle,
     Guided by the powers of the Goetia and the wisdom of the occult.
     Come forth, Valefor, and let us work together with mutual respect and purpose."

5. Continue to focus on Valefor's sigil, concentrating your energy on summoning him into the circle.

6. Once you feel Valefor's presence, greet him with respect and present the offerings. Clearly, state your intent and desire for cooperation.

7. Listen carefully for any responses or insights from Valefor, maintaining the proper focus and respect throughout the interaction.


### V. Dismissal and banishing of Valefor:

1. When you have completed your cooperation with Valefor, recite the following words of dismissal:

    "Valefor, I express my gratitude for your presence and cooperation,
     But now, our work here is complete.
     Return to your domain, and let the boundaries between our worlds close,
     May our mutual respect persist, and may our paths cross again if destiny wills it."

2. Snuff out the black and purple candles, signaling the end of the ritual.

3. Sound the bell three times, allowing its vibrations to cleanse and close the space.

4. Dismantle the protective circle, visualizing the white light dissipating and the spiritual energies returning to balance.

5. Properly dispose of the offerings and ritual materials.

Remember always to approach these rituals with the utmost respect, and to ensure that your intentions are pure and genuine. Engaging in these practices can carry great responsibility and potential risks, so proceed with caution and due diligence.
