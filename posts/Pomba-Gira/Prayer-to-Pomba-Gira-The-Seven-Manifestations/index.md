  In the name of the powerful and seductive Pomba Gira, the enchantress of transformation, I begin this intricate and unique prayer as a faithful and humble supplicant. Surrounded by the symbols of her divine power—the crossroads, the red rose, the keys, and the sacred chalice—I seek her protection and guidance, calling upon the seven manifestations that signify her transcendent nature:
  
  Pomba Gira Maria Padilha, who embodies the desires and temptations of life, in your red and black robes I seek your wisdom. Open my eyes to the allure of pleasure, teach me the art of loving, and guide my steps towards fulfilling relationships.
  
  Pomba Gira Mulambo, the mysterious one, dressed in tattered clothes yet regal in demeanor, help me to overcome obstacles and transform the adversities of my life into precious experiences, shaping me into a stronger and more resilient being.
  
  Pomba Gira Dama da Noite, the lady of the night, in your black dress you dwell where uncertainty dwells. Bestow upon me the ability to traverse the unknown with the same grace and poise that you do, navigating darkness with unerring intuition.
  
  Pomba Gira Rainha das Almas, the queen of souls, crowned and adorned with the white full moon, share with me your connection to the spiritual realm, and bring forth the voices of my ancestors and guides who wish to guide me on my path.
  
  Pomba Gira Cigana, the wandering gypsy spirit draped in colorful fabrics, your mystical powers make all those who seek your wisdom marvel. Teach me the hidden arts lost to common memory, and make me a resourceful traveler in the face of life's challenges.
  
  Pomba Gira Menina, the playful and mischievous child, may your laughter and innocence permeate my existence, so that joy becomes my constant companion and the most challenging situations reveal their hidden lightness.
  
  Pomba Gira Sete Saias, the seven-skirted one, clothed in the vibrant and varied fabrics of existence, guide me through the complexities of the human experience, bringing balance and harmony to every facet of my life.
  
  As I complete this sacred prayer, enshrouded in the candlelight's warm glow, I offer you, Pomba Gira, the tokens of my gratitude: the finest cigars, purest cachaça, sumptuous chocolates, and fragrant roses. May these tangible representations of my devotion bring forth your divine presence and manifest your benevolence in my life.
  
  I entreat you, great and powerful Pomba Gira, envelope me in your transformative and seductive energies, lead my heart, mind, and soul in the pursuit of fulfillment, passion, and success. In your powerful and enchanting name, I pray. Laroyê!
