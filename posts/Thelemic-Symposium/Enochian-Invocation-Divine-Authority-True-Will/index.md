Passage: "Ol sonuf vaoresaji, gohu IAD Balata, elanusaha caelazod"

This specific passage is an excerpt from the 19th Enochian Key, also known as the 1st Key of the 30 Aethyrs. It is one of the calls or invocations used in Enochian magic, a system of ceremonial magic developed by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley in the late 16th century. The Enochian language is considered by many to be the "angelic language", and its utilization is aimed at communicating with and summoning angelic entities.

**Translation**: "I reign over ye, says the God of Justice, in power exalted above the firmaments of wrath"

Within the context of a Thelemic Symposium, this passage carries potency in its symbolic representation and can be connected to Thelemic principles in various ways, since the Thelema tradition is an amalgamation of Western esoteric thought, including the influence of Enochian magick.

1. **Structure**: The passage is comprised of three clauses:
   a) "Ol sonuf vaoresaji" - "I reign over ye"
   b) "gohu IAD Balata" - "says the God of Justice"
   c) "elanusaha caelazod" - "in power exalted above the firmaments of wrath"

Each clause in the passage represents an aspect of authority, identity, and realm of influence.

2. **Symbolism**: The passage symbolizes divine authority vested in the God of Justice, which is reminiscent of the Thelemic principle of True Will - the divine purpose of an individual being that is aligned with the universal order. In this regard, the passage speaks of empowerment that arises from connecting with one's True Will.

3. **Connections to Thelemic Principles**: The Thelema tradition places great importance on finding and aligning oneself with one's True Will, as encapsulated in the phrase, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." The concept of divine authority referenced in the passage mirrors the idea of realizing one's unique purpose and aligning with it, thereby transcending earthly limitations and accessing higher states of consciousness.

4. **Creative Interpretations**: The term "in power exalted above the firmaments of wrath" could be alternatively translated as "rising above the planes of anger," denoting the overcoming of base emotions and low vibratory states in order to evolve spiritually. This provides an additional layer of meaning to the passage, connecting it to the transformative process that an individual undergoes in the pursuit of their True Will.

In conclusion, the Enochian passage is a powerful invocation relevant to the Thelemic Symposium due to its focus on divine authority and alignment with one's True Will, which are central concepts within Thelema. By examining the structure, symbolism, and potential alternative translations, we can gain deeper insights into the esoteric and occult meanings of the passage, opening up new avenues for exploration, understanding, and spiritual growth.
