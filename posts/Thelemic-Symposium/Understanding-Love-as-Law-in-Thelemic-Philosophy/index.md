  Analyze the significance of "Love is the law, love under will" in the context of the Thelemic Symposium, demonstrating how this phrase intertwines with the three perspectives of ontology, epistemology, and ethics, ultimately manifesting in one's personal path towards achieving the Great Work.

"Love is the law, love under will" is a central tenet of Thelema, a philosophical and spiritual paradigm founded by the English occultist Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century. This phrase serves as a guiding principle for those who seek to attain the Great Work, a term used by many hermetic traditions to denote the ultimate goal of self-realization and spiritual advancement. To fully understand the significance of this statement within the Thelemic Symposium, we will explore its intertwining with the three perspectives of ontology, epistemology, and ethics, and how it contributes to an individual's journey towards the Great Work.

Ontology:
In the context of Thelema, ontology refers to the nature of reality and being. Central to Thelemic ontology is the concept of True Will, which is the divine purpose of the individual's existence, hidden deep within the self. "Love is the law, love under will" asserts that love is a driving force in the universe. This love, however, must be guided and directed by one's True Will, implying that our actions should be inspired by love but ultimately motivated by our Will's purpose in the cosmos. By aligning ourselves with our Will, we become closer to the divine and ultimately unravel the mysteries of reality.

Epistemology:
Epistemology within the Thelemic Symposium concerns the nature and scope of knowledge, and how we can come to understand the truths of existence. "Love is the law, love under will" acknowledges that knowledge can be derived through the force of love - whether it be the love of the self, a love of humanity, or a love of spiritual matters. Knowledge gained through love-driven experiences often leads to a deeper understanding of the self and our True Will. Hence, love is not just a mere emotion, but rather a catalyst for gaining insight into the nature of reality and our role within it.

Ethics:
In the Thelemic Symposium, ethics revolves around the principles that guide our actions and decisions. "Love is the law, love under will" emphasizes that love should serve as the basis of our ethical conduct and interactions with others, as long as it is under the direction of the True Will. Adhering to this tenet ensures that our actions are not only guided by love but also grounded in our True Will, leading to a balanced and harmonious life. In turn, this facilitates our progress along the path towards the Great Work, as we align our actions and intentions with the divine purpose of our existence.

Manifestation in Personal Path:
In conclusion, "Love is the law, love under will" is a profound statement that holds great significance within the Thelemic Symposium. It intertwines with the perspectives of ontology, epistemology, and ethics to illuminate the central role of love and True Will in our understanding of reality, ethical conduct, and personal growth. This tenet ultimately serves as a touchstone on the individual's journey towards achieving the Great Work, emphasizing the importance of aligning oneself with the forces of love and the divine purpose inherent within each of us.
