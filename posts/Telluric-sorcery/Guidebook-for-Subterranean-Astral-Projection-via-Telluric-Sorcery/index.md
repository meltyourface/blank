To achieve successful astral projection using advanced Telluric sorcery tailored for exploring the hidden depths of subterranean realms, follow these steps to perform the ritual:

### I. **Preparation**:

1. Select a location near a natural subterranean feature, such as a cave or a fissure, to create a strong connection to the earth's energies.
2. Choose a time when the elements are in harmony with the earth, preferably during the new moon or on the night of the winter solstice, as these strengthen Telluric energies.
3. **Prepare your ritual space by drawing a large, protective circle using salt, and create an altar in the center with the following focal objects**: a shallow dish of fine soil, a quartz crystal, and a copper rod. Additionally, arrange four candles (one black, one white, one brown, and one gray) at cardinal directions around the circle.

### II. **Ritual Components**:

1. Begin by cleansing the ritual space and your physical body with sage or any other purifying incense of your choice to create a clean energetic environment.
2. **Light the candles in a clockwise manner, starting with the black one in the North, while invoking the elements as you proceed**: Earth in the North, Air in the East, Fire in the South, and Water in the West.
3. Adorn yourself with a necklace or talisman made of a natural, earth-derived material, such as clay or stone. This will serve as a tether to your astral form, helping to navigate and ensure safe return.
4. Next, draw the sigil of Agarroth, the Earth's Guide, on your forehead with mud or earth to grant you the gift of subterranean sight and protection. The sigil consists of an eye within a downward-pointing triangle, with three intersecting circles surrounding it to represent the interconnectedness of the realms and elements. 
5. Sit or lie down within the circle, facing the altar, and begin to create a continuous flow of energy by running the soil through your fingers. Focus your intent on the exploration and understanding of the unknown depths beneath the earth's surface.   

### III. **Incantations**:

Recite the following incantation to invoke Agarroth's guidance and commence the astral journey:

*“Agarroth, Guide of Deeper Realms, Heed my call and share thy sight,
With Telluric force, I now invoke, The veil between shall part this night.
Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Grant me entrance to the core,
Astral body set to roam, As above, so shall I explore.”*

### IV. **Astral Projection**:

As reciting the incantation, hold the quartz crystal in your right hand and the copper rod in your left. Envision your astral body separating from your physical form and hovering above the circle. The sigil of Agarroth on your forehead will act as a guiding light, illuminating the hidden pathways of the subterranean realms.

### V. **Navigational Aids and Safeguards**:

1. Follow the illuminated path created by the sigil while traversing the hidden depths. It will lead you towards interesting and informative experiences.
2. Maintain an open line of communication with the talisman or necklace crafted earlier, allowing for swift return if needed.
3. The copper rod will not only amplify the Telluric energies but also serve as a counterbalance to any hostile energies encountered on the journey.

### VI. **Return and Closing the Ritual**:

1. To return, hold onto your talisman or necklace tightly and draw awareness back to your physical body.
2. Once fully reunited with your physical form, thank Agarroth and the elements, extinguish the candles in reverse order, and erase the sigil from your forehead.
3. Dissolve the salt circle and return all objects to their proper places.

This advanced Telluric sorcery method will allow for an immersive experience exploring the unknown subterranean realms, addressing potential challenges and providing navigational aids and safeguards to ensure a meaningful, successful astral journey.
