  O Gracious Ones of the Three Circles of Manifestation,
  Eternal bearers of the aspects unseen,
  We beseech thee within the azure vault of resonance,
  Firmament's visage shimmering betwixt Earth and infinity.
  
  In the First Circle, imbued with the primordial essence,
  Rise divine amalgam of the corporeal, cerebral, and ethereal,
  Forge, transmute, and balance ever our trinity of being:
  Mind, Body, and Soul in a sublime, infinite resonance.
  
  Sagacious Solaris of the Second Circle,
  Emissary of the heavenly firmament, bestow upon us celestial favor,
  Attune us to the cosmic forces ascending and descending,
  Envelop us in the sacred barrier, a mantle of cosmic vigor.
  
  Blessed protectors veil our vulnerabilities and strengthen our resolve,
  Celestial guardians anchor us in the astral light that illumines our path,
  Shield us from the wiles of nefarious forces,
  Empyrean sentinels, unite thy strength with ours, blending in sacred harmony.
  
  In the Third and all-encompassing Circle,
  Liberate the ancient wisdom, the mystic tongues of yore,
  Linguistic echoes that teach, guide, and empower,
  Aegis of our ancestors, woven within the tapestry of truths united.
  
  Through the amplified potency of this reverberant incantation,
  We evoke the omnipresent emanations of creation,
  Let the Sacred Three scintillate within and around us,
  An everlasting testament to the timeless, interwoven threads of faith.
  
  May the Three Circles of Manifestation merge,
  Binding us to the celestial essence that orbits our very existence,
  Bestow upon us unyielding spirit, power, and purpose,
  Engaging us in the eternal dance of cosmic alignment and divine intent.
  
  As above, so below, forever united within the Three,
  Transcending time and space, interconnected grace,
  In faith, we stand resolute, and thus, we shall be,
  Manifested, transformed, and unified in splendiferous melody.
  
  So shall it be.
