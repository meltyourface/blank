description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Three Circles of Manifestation, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a series of intricate invocations dedicated to the deities or energies specifically governing each of the Three Circles of Manifestation, ensuring each invocation encompasses unique linguistic patterns and ancient symbols. For the Circle of the Physical Plane, focus on deities related to the material world and its elements; for the Circle of the Astral Plane, concentrate on celestial beings and energies tied to ethereal realms; and for the Circle of the Causal Plane, center your attention on transcendent entities associated with higher dimensions and cosmic wisdom. Craft a minimum of three invocations for each Circle, incorporating distinct styles and formats to portray the complexity and richness of these esoteric domains.

Circle of the Physical Plane - Invocation I:

By the breath of the Wind-Sire and the embrace of the Earth-Mother,
In the name of the Water-Bearer and the forge of the Fire-Dancer,
Elements unite and heed my call, combine in consonance,
Within this sacred space, a circle drawn in sand, salt, and stone.

Circle of the Physical Plane - Invocation II:

Praise to the Guardians of the North,
Earth-bound spirits, ivy-twined,
Bestow upon me your fortitude,
And anchor my manifestation in firmament.

Praise to the Guardians of the East,
Air-crowned seraphs of zephyr and gale,
Grant me clarity of purpose,
Be a bellows to the embers of my creation.

Praise to the Guardians of the South,
Fire-lords smoldering in caverns deep,
Lend me your ceaseless passion,
And bring forth my conjuring, scorching and pure.

Praise to the Guardians of the West,
Flowing spirits of the ever-changing tide,
Wash over me with constraining currents,
And shape my desires, as river routes the stone.

Circle of the Physical Plane - Invocation III:

Venerated Beings of the Forest and Gale,
Show me the ways of primordial transformation,
Alchemists, guide my hands and mind,
To master my works in clay and mist.

Circle of the Astral Plane - Invocation I:

I call upon the Stargazers, the Navigators by Silver Ray,
Guides through the ether, celestial envoys,
Gleaming in the twilight of dreams and visions.

Circle of the Astral Plane - Invocation II:

Luminary Regents, Archangels, and Astral Seraphs,
Illuminate the veiled paths of transcendent realms,
Ethereal Perceptors, grant me passage through your kaleidoscopic shades.

Circle of the Astral Plane - Invocation III:

Spirits of the Astral Sphere, Emissaries of Thoughtscapes,
As mind weaves through your aether, empower my intent,
Transmute my thoughts/schemas, to color the fabric of reality.

Circle of the Causal Plane - Invocation I:

Eternal entities of Cosmic Wisdom, Geometers of the Unseen,
Listen to my plea, grant me the knowledge, sacred and hidden.

Circle of the Causal Plane - Invocation II:

Paragons of Sentient Concord, Masters of Cosmic Symmetry,
Divine Architects, guide my hand, the compass and the rule,
In harmony with Universal Laws, as above, so below.

Circle of the Causal Plane - Invocation III:

By the will of the Infinite unknown, the Monad, the All,
May Truth, Love, and Power align, and the Great Work be performed,
In the hallowed space where spirit and matter merge,
The Three Circles of Manifestation manifest!
