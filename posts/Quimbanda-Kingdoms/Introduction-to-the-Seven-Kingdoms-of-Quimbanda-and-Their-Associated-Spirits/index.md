To fully examine the seven Kingdoms of Quimbanda, it is essential to provide an introduction to Quimbanda itself for a young student who might not have encountered this topic before. Quimbanda is an Afro-Brazilian religion, a spiritual practice that blends African traditions, brought to Brazil by enslaved Africans, with the spiritual beliefs of the indigenous people of Brazil and elements of Catholicism. The religion is highly syncretic in nature and identifies with a vast pantheon of spirits and deities called Exus, Pomba Giras, and Caboclos.

The seven Kingdoms of Quimbanda are distinct realms within this spiritual cosmology, and each one represents unique attributes, energies, and vibrational frequencies. By understanding these kingdoms and their corresponding spirits, we can learn how they manifest in rituals, spiritual practices, and human life experiences.
