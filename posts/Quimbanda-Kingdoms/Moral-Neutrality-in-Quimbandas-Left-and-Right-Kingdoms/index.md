Answer: - Both Kingdoms are morally neutral, with the Left focusing on material pursuits and the Right on spiritual ones.

**Explanation**: In the context of Quimbanda Kingdoms, the distinction between the Kingdoms of Left and Right lies in their focus and purpose, not in the moral alignment. Both Kingdoms are considered morally neutral, as it is the intentions of the practitioners that determine the outcome of their magical workings. 

The Left Kingdom focuses on material pursuits, such as wealth, health, and love, and its spirits and entities can be called upon for assistance in these matters. The Left Kingdom represents the earthly and physical aspects of life, and its workings may be perceived as more accessible and immediate. In contrast, the Right Kingdom is concerned with spiritual pursuits, including connecting with higher spiritual realms, seeking enlightenment, and understanding the mysteries of existence. The Right Kingdom emphasizes the importance of learning, spiritual growth, and development.

It is crucial to understand that neither Kingdom is inherently evil or good, contrary to popular misconceptions. Both can be used for beneficial or malicious purposes, depending on the intention of the practitioner. The ethical consequences of magical workings in the Quimbanda tradition derive from the individual's choices and actions, not the kingdoms themselves.

Quimbanda is an Afro-Brazilian religion that has its roots in traditional African belief systems and incorporates elements from Catholicism. It is practiced primarily in Brazil but has spread to other countries due to the African diaspora. The religion's focus on both material and spiritual pursuits reflects the importance of balancing and integrating various aspects of life, allowing practitioners to connect with both the physical and metaphysical realms for personal growth and well-being.

In conclusion, the distinction between the Kingdoms of Left and Right in the Quimbanda tradition lies in their focus on material and spiritual pursuits, with both kingdoms being morally neutral. Understanding this distinction is essential for a comprehensive knowledge of the Quimbanda religion and its magical workings.
