The correct answer is The Kingdom of White Cloth.

**Explanation and context**: 

Quimbanda is an Afro-Brazilian religion that emerged in the early 20th century, primarily in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. It is a syncretic faith that incorporates elements of African spiritual traditions, indigenous Brazilian beliefs, and European spiritualities, such as Catholicism and Kardecist Spiritism. This unique blend gives rise to various rituals, deities, and spirits known as Exus and Pomba Giras.

The Quimbanda religious system is organized into seven kingdoms, each representing different aspects, energies, and manifestations of the divine. These seven kingdoms are:

1. The Kingdom of Souls (Reino das Almas): This kingdom is associated with spirits of the dead and ancestral spirits. It embodies the metaphysical connection between the living and the deceased. Through this kingdom, people seek guidance, protection, and blessings from their ancestors.

2. The Kingdom of Crossroads (Reino das Encruzilhadas): This kingdom symbolizes the sacred space where different paths, choices, and energies converge. The crossroads are considered portals that facilitate communication between the physical and spiritual realms. Spirits from this kingdom are associated with sorcery, protection, and divination.

3. The Kingdom of Fresh Waters (Reino das Águas): Connected with the element of water, this kingdom represents purification, emotional healing, fertility, and love. Here, spiritual entities associated with rivers, lakes, and waterfalls are invoked for their blessings and wisdom.

4. The Kingdom of Cemeteries (Reino dos Cemitérios): This kingdom is linked to death, transformation, and rebirth. Through the spirits associated with cemeteries, people seek guidance in matters of spiritual growth, overcoming obstacles, and accessing hidden knowledge.

5. The Kingdom of Forests (Reino das Matas): Representing the element of earth, this kingdom is associated with nature spirits, herbalism, and environmental healing. It embodies the nurturing energies of Mother Earth and the wisdom of the natural world.

6. The Kingdom of Mountains (Reino das Montanhas): Symbolizing the element of fire, this kingdom represents the transformative power of sacred fires. Entities connected to this kingdom are invoked for strength, evoking passions, and protection.

7. The Kingdom of Seashores (Reino das Praias): This kingdom is connected to the element of air and the sea's cleansing, revitalizing powers. Spirits from this realm offer guidance in matters of emotional and spiritual healing, creativity, and mystery.

The Kingdom of White Cloth does not exist within the Quimbanda Kingdoms. It might be a term related to other Afro-Brazilian religions like Umbanda or Candomble, where white cloth may be used for purification or rituals. In Quimbanda, the focus is on the seven kingdoms mentioned above, each representing a unique aspect of existence and spiritual energies.
