## The Seal of Seven Crossroads

**Objective**: To close and seal interdimensional gateways to the spirit realm, specifically addressing the involvement of Exus and Pombagiras throughout the ceremony.

### I. Preparation of the Ritual

1. Personal cleansing and purification: Prior to the ritual, it is essential that the practitioner undergo a cleansing bath with specific herbs (such as rue, guinea hen weed, rosemary) related to Exus and Pombagiras.

2. Gathering of ritual tools: The practitioner will need to acquire a tridente (ritual trident), pontos riscados (sacred sigils), offerings (such as candles, cigars, alcohol, and fruits), as well as incense.

3. Space purification: To ensure the ritual area is cleansed and protected, the practitioner should sweep and clean it both physically and spiritually, using a broom to create a sacred space for the spirits and a ritual circle surrounding the area.

### II. Opening the Ritual

1. Invocation of Exus and Pombagiras: Begin by invoking Exus and Pombagiras who serve as both guides and intermediaries between the spiritual and physical worlds. Call upon their powers to assist in the closing and sealing of interdimensional gateways.

2. Recitation of a prayer or sacred text specific to the Quimbanda Kingdoms tradition: This will serve to further ground and protect the ceremony while invoking the energy necessary to complete the complex process of closing the interdimensional gateways.

### III. Main Ritual Procedure

1. Sequential invocations of deities: Call upon and invoke the seven primary Exus of the Seven Kingdoms systematically, each representing one of the seven crossroads:

   A. Exu do Lodo
   B. Exu Ventania
   C. Exu Meia Noite
   D. Exu Tranca-Rua
   E. Exu Pimenta
   F. Exu Marab√¥
   G. Exu Tiriri

2. Sequential evocations of spiritual entities: After invoking each Exu, evoke the corresponding Pombagira to assist in the closing process:

   A. Pombagira das Almas
   B. Pombagira Rainha dos Raios
   C. Pombagira Maria Padilha
   D. Pombagira Dama da Noite
   E. Pombagira Rosa Caveira
   F. Pombagira Mulambo
   G. Pombagira Sete-Saias

3. Drawing of pontos riscados: Inscribe the sacred sigils related to each invoked Exu and evoked Pombagira on the ground around the ritual space. This will help to channel and direct the specific energies needed to seal the gateways.

4. Offering and implementation of ritual tools: Utilize the tridente by directing its end toward each of the interdimensional gateways while reciting the appropriate incantations. Present the offerings to Exus and Pombagiras and release the power embedded in the ritual tools.

### IV. Closing the Ritual

1. Express gratitude to Exus and Pombagiras: Once the interdimensional gateways have been closed and sealed, thank each Exu and Pombagira for their assistance and guidance.

2. Dismiss the deities and spiritual entities: Systematically bid farewell to each invoked deity and evoked entity, allowing them to graciously return to their respective realms.

3. Cleanse and purify the ritual space: Once the invocation has ended, cleanse the ritual area again to clear out any remaining energies.

### V. Potential Implications, Precautions, and Benefits

1. Implications: Practitioners should be aware of the tremendous power they may unleash throughout the ceremony. The process of sealing interdimensional gateways may reveal hidden knowledge and unlock unforeseen experiences.

2. Precautions: A deep understanding of the Quimbanda Kingdoms, Exus and Pombagiras, as well as proper respect for the spirits and their energies is essential. Insufficient preparation or understanding can yield dire consequences.

3. Benefits: Successfully completing this ritual will result in the protection and strengthening of the physical and spiritual realms. Practitioners and their communities will enjoy an increased sense of security and spiritual balance.
