Verse I:
In shadows of mystery, the Quimbanda realms reside,
Where cosmic energies and ancient wisdom coincide,
Exu, Pomba Gira, faithful guides and guardians divine,
Lead us through the abyss of life, entwined like sacred vine.

Exu and Pomba Gira, sublime spirits of cosmic night,
In the kingdom of Quimbanda, we seek refuge in your light,
Together in celestial dance, your power we revere,
In the echoes of our hearts, your ancient hymns we hear.

Verse II:
Exu, spirit of crossroads and lightning's fiery blaze,
Through life's labyrinthine passages, we thread your ways,
Protector, Messenger, the cosmic Joker's jest,
In the twilight realm between worlds, you traverse best.

Pomba Gira, Queen of the Night, seductive and sublime,
In your bewitching charm, the secrets of the world entwine,
Your wisdom and authority, our hearts doth recognize,
Through the power of your love, we discover our spiritual ties.

Exu and Pomba Gira, sublime spirits of cosmic night,
In the kingdom of Quimbanda, we seek refuge in your light,
Together in celestial dance, your power we revere,

Within the legions of the Quimbanda kingdoms' ranks,
The spiritual realm whispers, and life's currents ebb and sway,
From the depths of the earth to the boundless cosmic plane,
Sorcerous arts and mystic runes guide our paths each day.

Verse V:
Reflections of creation as above, so below,
In the divinations crimson hands, our fates are foretold,
Through the cycles of reincarnation, we tread the spiral path,
Ever-growing, ever-learning, to find our sacred hearth.

Exu and Pomba Gira, sublime spirits of cosmic night,
In the kingdom of Quimbanda, we seek refuge in your light,
Together in celestial dance, your power we revere,
In the echoes of our hearts, your ancient hymns we hear.

At the altar of transformation, we offer our tributes and obeisance,
In the presence of Exu, Pomba Gira, and the legion of radiant spirits,
We walk the path of the ancestors, guided by timeless resilience,
In the Quimbanda Kingdom, our hearts alight, our souls uplifted.

Celebrating the intricate web of Quimbanda kingdoms,
Old and new, fire and water, passion and wisdom
Embrace and guide us on this infinite celestial ground.
