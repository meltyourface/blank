## I. Invocation

Hail to the keepers of mysteries old,
To the guardians of wisdom divine,
To the weavers who traverse the threshold,
Of Quimbanda kingdoms entwined.

### II. Exu, Lord of the Crossroads

Exu, Lord of the Crossroads, herald of change,
Dwells at the margins with cunning and jest,
Master of gateways, Granter of fate,
Navigate the labyrinth, in pursuit of the quest.

Through the Candombl√© echoes his laughter,
As stories and secrets in whispers unfold,
No door is sealed, no passage restricted,
For Exu, the key to all truths doth hold.

### III. Pomba Gira, Queen of the Night

At the moirai of flame, desire, and allure,
With smoke and dance enrapturing the air,
Pomba Gira, enchantress, eternal seductress,
Swirl within the whirlwind, flames of passion flare.

Fierce Quimbanda Queen, of hearts and devotion,
Balance to Exu, conciliator of strife,
In you we confide, our deepest emotions,
Guide us, O Queen, along the pathways of life.

### IV. Legion Spirit Guides, Beacons in the Shadows

Spirit guides of Quimbanda's vast calling,
Legions of diverse origins, unite,
Ancestral spirits, your wisdom and counsel,
Reveal the realms hidden from mortal sight.

In the shadows we journey, encircled by whispers,
Strength in unity, convergence of might,
Light the way through darkness, bestow insight,
With the flicker of the candle, let wisdom ignite.

### V. The Nexus of Life and Power

In life's cycles, the rhythms and beats,
Exu and Pomba Gira entwine,
With their legions, in spiritual symphony,
Celebrate, learn, and enshrine.

### VI. Epilogue

In the Quimbanda Kingdom, where spirits abound,
The ancient web glimmers with treasures profound,
In the hands of Exu, Pomba Gira, and kin,
We explore the connection 'tween human and divine,
Embrace the arcane, let the myst'ry commence,
The Quimbanda's secrets and wisdom, dispensed.
