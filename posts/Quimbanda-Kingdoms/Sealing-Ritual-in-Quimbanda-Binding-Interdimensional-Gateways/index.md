## The Sealing Rite of the Veiled Pathways

Objective:
To close and seal interdimensional gateways to the spirit realm through an intricate and comprehensive Quimbanda Kingdoms ritual that addresses the involvement of Exus and Pombagiras, utilizing ritual tools such as tridentes, pontos riscados, and offerings, with sequential invocations and evocations of deities and spiritual entities.

Preparations:
1. Ensure the ritual area is clean and purified with the sacred smoke of a Palo Santo stick. Arrange the altar with a white cloth, candles, incense, and offering plates.
2. Prepare the Tridents (tridentes), a symbol of power and authority over spirits. Ensure three tridentes are crafted from iron, wood, and gold respectively, each decorated and embellished with sigils, pontos riscados and stones.
3. Craft the Pontos Riscados associated with the specific Exus and Pombagiras involved in the ritual. Provide ample parchment, ink, and drawing tools.
4. Prepare a suitable offering for the spirits, which may include tobacco, rum, fruits, flowers, or other items preferred by the individual spirits.

Ritual Phases:

Phase 1: Invoking the Guardians
1. Light candles and incense on the altar.
2. Anoint yourself with a protective oil made from herbs, seeds, and essential oils associated with Exu and Pombagira.
3. Assume a meditative posture and chant the sacred hymn of Exu seven times to invoke his protective energy.

Phase 2: Connecting to the Exus and Pombagiras
1. On the parchment, draw the Pontos Riscados associated with the Exus and Pombagiras that will seal the interdimensional gateways.
2. Hold the tridente made of iron and invoke each Exu and Pombagira by name, asking for their assistance in binding and sealing the spirit realm's pathways.
3. Present the offerings, and assure them that you are working for the greater good.

Phase 3: Guided Sealing
1. With the assistance of the Exus and Pombagiras, locate the interdimensional gateways that need sealing.
2. To strengthen the connection and synchronize energies, perform individual invocations and dances, guided by the Exus and Pombagiras.
3. Place the iron tridente at the threshold of the gateways, while reciting a sealing chant, to bind the portal.

Phase 4: Ensuring a Secured Barrier
1. Use the wooden tridente to trace new Pontos Riscados into the ground, reinforcing the protective barrier at each gateway.
2. Request that the Exus and Pombagiras infuse their energies into the barrier, securing and strengthening it further.
3. Place the gold trident next to the previously placed iron tridente, signifying that the sealing is complete and the portal closed.

Phase 5: Thanking the Spirits
1. Offer gratitude and praise to the Exus and Pombagiras for their contributions.
2. Perform a closing dance, specialized for each spirit, to bid them farewell and release them back into their realm.
3. Snuff the candles and incense, signaling the end of the ritual.

Potential Implications, Precautions, and Benefits:
- Ensure to maintain complete respect and reverence for the Exus and Pombagiras to avoid disrupting the ritual or causing them to turn hostile.
- The sealing of interdimensional gateways helps protect the living plane from unwanted spirit energies, malignant entities, and uncontrolled forces.
- Completing this ritual successfully may foster a stronger relationship with Exus and Pombagiras and demonstrate your commitment to the balance of spiritual and material realms.
