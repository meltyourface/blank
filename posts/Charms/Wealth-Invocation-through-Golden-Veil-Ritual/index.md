## Title: Ceremony of the Golden Veil

Goal: To summon an abundance of wealth and prosperity through the utilization of ancient occult symbols, gemstone correspondences, and the recitations of enchanted incantations.

Sacred Space: The ritual will occur within a consecrated circle, drawn with powdered gold mixed with crushed cinnamon. Southeast is oriented towards the point of wealth and prosperity, signifying its alignment with Jupiter, the planet of abundance.

Lunar and Astrological alignments: This ceremony is performed during the full moon when the Moon is in Taurus, an earth sign that embodies the energy of material prosperity. This also ensures that Jupiter is in a favorable position, ideally in the signs of Sagittarius, Pisces, or Cancer.

Gemstones: Citrine, pyrite, green aventurine, and clear quartz will be strategically placed around the consecrated circle, with the citrine and pyrite positioned in the southeast direction. Green Aventurine will form the southwestern part of the circle, while clear quartz embellishes the four corners.

The Altar:

1. A golden, square cloth is laid upon the altar.
2. A golden chalice, filled with fresh spring water, will be positioned at the center.
3. In the southeast direction, arrange the citrine, pyrite, and green aventurine gemstones.
4. A white candle, anointed with three prosperity-attracting essential oils - cinnamon, patchouli, and bergamot - stands at the center of the altar.
5. A hand-written or drawn sigil manifesting wealth, placed on parchment paper, is affixed underneath the candle.
6. Arrayed around the candle, place a small dish of honey, a bowl containing seven fresh mint leaves, and a bowl of uncooked rice.
7. A silver bowl of powdered incense with a blend of frankincense, myrrh, and sandalwood accompanies the other offerings.

Ceremonial Actions:

1. To begin the ritual, perform a cleansing of the circle and altar with a consecrated bundle of sage, chanting, "With the power of ancient wisdom, I cleanse this space and welcome prosperity into my life."

2. Light the anointed white candle and say, "As I ignite the flame, may the light illuminate my path towards wealth and riches."

3. **Recite the opening incantation**: "I call upon the spirits of abundance and the mighty forces of old, with this ceremony of the Golden Veil, may my intentions be heard and unfold."

4. Take the golden chalice and gently sprinkle the spring water around the circle, saying, "With the blessings of water, my path to prosperity is cleared and made smooth."

5. Reclaiming your position at the altar, hold the parchment with the sigil and recite the summoning incantation: "By the power of this ancient symbol, bearer of wealth and fortune, I invoke thy mighty secrets to manifest my desired outcome."

6. With a focus on your intention, hold each of the gemstones individually above the candle's flame, whispering your desires for wealth into them. After, place them back in their original positions.

7. Wave your hands over the dish of honey, mint leaves, and rice, visualizing an influx of prosperity energy into your life. Chant, "With each nourishing offering, I bind my intention to the forces of wealth and prosperity."

8. Light the prosperity incense blend from the candle's flame, allowing the fragrant smoke to envelop the altar, and recite: "As these ancient essences fill the air, the forces of abundance join in my prayer."

9. **Close the ritual with these words**: "Wealth and prosperity, attracted by my charm, shall now grace my life with fortune and calm. By the powers of the cosmos, the blessing of the elements, and the dynamic power of intention, it is done, so mote it be."

10. Blow out the candle and carefully dismantle the altar. The ritual is complete.

Note: Dispose of the honey and mint leaves in a respectful manner and store the candle, sigil, and stones in a safe and sacred space.
