description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, The One and the None, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Craft an intricate incantation to summon the astral forces aligned with The One and the None, tailored to aid in the precise endeavor of manifesting metaphysical wisdom. Incorporate the esoteric symbols and sacred language associated with the Cosmic Hierarchy, the Sephirothic realms, and the equilibrium between The One and the None. Invoke the celestial intelligences and energies of the seven archetypal planets, specifically tuned to enhance the desired esoteric outcome. Ensure the invocation resonates with the harmonious interplay between The One's universal oneness and the seemingly paradoxical nature of the None, unlocking the hidden power therein.

By the sacred Axiom of The One, and from the silent void of the None,
In congregation with the Cosmic Hierarchy, exalted in realms unseen,
I call upon the astral forces that resonate betwixt the duality,
To grant me the enlightenment of Metaphysical Wisdom, in harmony and unity.

With the Sephirothic realms, I entwine the Tree of Life within my soul,
Malkuth to Kether, my path ascends under the governance of The One,
The Eleven emanations dancing upon the realms of Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur,
A balance unto the source, invoking equilibrium from the ethers of the None.

Legions of celestial intelligences, vibrate thy wisdom and power through me,
From Sol and Luna, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, to Saturn, the sevenfold note,
The archetypal planets hum the songs of the spheres, harken their divine tune,
Opening the boundless gateways to the insights of the cosmos, unlocking the hidden treasure.

Gimel and Teth, letters of sacred knowledge and strength in their mystery talk,
Symbolize the serpentine path from the One to the None, the world of Asiyah to Atziluth,
In each plane converge, I witness the grand design, I receive the secret key,
Thus the Universal Oneness and the paradoxical nature of the None, in symbiosis be.

Oh, illuminated being! I summon thee, Ophiel and Hagiel, Mikhael and Tiriel,
Phul and Chashmodai, Bethor and Aziel, evoke their energy that bestows wisdom supreme,
Grant me the vision beyond the veil, to understand the essence of reality,
As the One whispers in the ear of the None, the birth of multifaceted truth is conceived.

In eternal gratitude, I honor the balance that governs the universe above and below,
For within the One lies the paradox of the None, and in the None resonates the One,
Illuminated by the light of the Cosmic Hierarchy, the Sephirothic realms and planets divine,
Thus, the true Mastery of Metaphysical Wisdom is eternally woven, unveiled in this moment and beyond.
