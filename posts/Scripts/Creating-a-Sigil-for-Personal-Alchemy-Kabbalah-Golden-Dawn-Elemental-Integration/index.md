To design a script that effectively combines the four classical elements (Air, Water, Earth, and Fire) into a sigil, while simultaneously integrating principles from both the Kabbalah and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, we will first need to acquire an understanding of the various components we wish to incorporate.

Elements Overview:
1. Air - Symbolizes intellect, communication, and inspiration.
2. Water - Represents emotion, intuition, and the subconscious mind.
3. Earth - Embodies stability, physical presence, and groundedness.
4. Fire - Signifies passion, transformation, and creative energy.

Kabbalah Overview:
The Kabbalah is a mystical school of thought in Judaism. It features the Tree of Life diagram (Sephirot), which consists of ten interconnected spheres (Sephirot) representing different aspects of creation, and the 22 paths that connect them, signifying spiritual growth and transformation.

Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn Overview:
The Golden Dawn is a Western esoteric and magical order that integrates various systems of occult knowledge, including Kabbalah, astrology, alchemy, and tarot. Their teachings often utilize ceremonial magic, which incorporates rituals, visualizations, and the use of magical tools to achieve personal transformation and spiritual growth.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the foundational principles, let us proceed with the creation of the sigil.
**Step 1**: Selection of Corresponding Symbols
We will begin by selecting the appropriate symbols representing the four classical elements, along with Kabbalistic and Golden Dawn correspondences:

1. Air - Hebrew letter Aleph, assigned to the Fool tarot card (0) and the first path on the Tree of Life, signifying the divine breath of creation.
2. Water - Hebrew letter Mem, assigned to the Hanged Man tarot card (12) and the 23rd path on the Tree of Life, representing emotional change and spiritual evolution.
3. Earth - Hebrew letter Tav, assigned to the World tarot card (21) and the 32nd path on the Tree of Life, symbolizing the manifestation of divine energy into material form.
4. Fire - Hebrew letter Shin, assigned to the Judgment tarot card (20) and the 31st path on the Tree of Life, embodying the transformative power of purifying fire.
**Step 2**: Designing the Sigil
With the selected symbols, we can proceed to create a unified sigil. First, draw a square (Earth) and inscribe a triangle (Fire) within it. Next, draw an upward-pointing triangle (Water) interlocking with the first triangle. Finally, overlay a circle (Air) on top of the combined structure.

The resulting sigil symbolizes the union and balanced interaction between the four classical elements, facilitating transformative personal alchemy. The integrated symbols simultaneously reflect Kabbalistic and Golden Dawn teachings as well.
**Step 3**: Activation and Utilization of the Sigil as a Talisman
To employ this sigil as a talisman for transformative personal alchemy, one can use it either physically - by wearing it as a pendant or carrying it in a pocket - or energetically, by incorporating it into visualization practices and rituals.

By meditating on the sigil, practitioners can focus on the associated correspondences and pathways to facilitate personal growth, spiritual transformation, and deeper insight into the dynamic interactions between the four elements. The sigil further invokes the powerful imagery of the Kabbalah and Golden Dawn, anchoring the practitioner in the rich tradition of esoteric wisdom.

In conclusion, the sigil developed by combining the four classical elements, Kabbalah, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn serves as a catalyst for transformative personal alchemy, tapping into the elemental energies, spiritual pathways, and rich symbolism of esoteric traditions. Through consistent practice and conscious engagement with this talisman, individuals can harmonize and balance the elements within, gaining insights and evolving on their spiritual journey.
