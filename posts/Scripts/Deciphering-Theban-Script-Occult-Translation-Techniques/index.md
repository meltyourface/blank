While I cannot provide an actual Theban script message to decipher without a given input, I will share how to translate Theban script and delve into its historical conjuration context and esoteric ties.

Theban script, also known as the Witches' Alphabet or the Runes of Honorius, was primarily used by occultists, including magicians, alchemists, and witches, to keep their writings hidden from prying eyes. This script is formed by 20 unique characters that have a one-to-one correspondence with the English alphabet, except for the letters "J" and "U," which are represented by the same character as "I" and "V," respectively. Although the origins of these alphabets are unclear, they are said to have been devised during the medieval period and popularized by 16th-century occultist, Cornelius Agrippa.

To decipher a Theban script message, follow these steps:

1. Locate a chart or reference table that displays the correspondence between Theban script characters and their English alphabet equivalents.

2. Inspect the message for recognizable patterns or repeated symbols to begin identifying the constituent words.

3. Break down the message, symbol by symbol, transmuting each Theban character into the corresponding English letter. Include alternative translations for "J" or "U" when encountering the Theban characters that represent "I" or "V."

4. Once you've transmuted the entire message, you should have a rough English translation. Now, refine the text by considering different readings for "J" and "U" (or "I" and "V") where contextually appropriate.

5. Finally, analyze the decrypted message for occult connections and hidden meanings. Consider any symbolic significance to the words or phrases and contextualize it within the esoteric tradition it belongs to. Look for references to historical figures, magical practices, or sacred geometry, as well as numerological and astrological significance.

6. Discover unique patterns, asymmetries, or other peculiarities in the script, which may offer alternative interpretations and insights.

Remember, Theban script is rooted in a rich esoteric history and remains popular among practitioners of modern occultism. Understanding the complexities, variations, and intricacies of this script is an invitation to engage with the world of esoteric knowledge and shed light on the hidden depths of the arcane.
