In designing a ritualistic Magick ceremony that incorporates the symbolism of the four elements, the seven chakras, the role of astral projection, and the significance of invoking a chosen deity, we must pay utmost attention to the desired personal transformation so that all elements within the ceremony are seamlessly interwoven with one another. 

Let us assume that the specific personal transformation sought is to enhance one's intuition and psychic abilities. ****In order to achieve this, we can devise a ceremony entitled "The Rite of the Mystical Eye," embracing the interplay of our key components****: the four elements, seven chakras, astral projection, and the invocation of a chosen deity.
**Step 1**: Preparation of the ceremonial space
Select a location that resonates with the practitioner's spiritual energy. ****Demarcate the area using the symbols representing the four elements****: earth, water, air, and fire. These symbols are essential for harnessing the elemental energies and establishing a connection to the natural world. Consider using incense for air, a chalice of water, a bowl of salt or soil for earth, and candles to symbolize fire. Place a central altar surrounded by these symbols, with a crystal ball, a blindfold, and an image or sigil of the chosen deity.
**Step 2**: Connecting with the seven chakras
As the practitioner stands in the ceremonial space, they should ground themselves by taking deep breaths and focusing on each of the seven chakras sequentially. By visualizing these energy centers pulsating with vibrant colors and entering a meditative state, they open the channels for the flow of divine energy required for the personal transformation.
**Step 3**: Astral projection
With the chakras activated, the practitioner will now enter a state of astral projection by visualizing their silver cord and projecting their consciousness beyond the physical realm. This will aid in accessing higher dimensions where intuitive insights and psychic abilities are amplified.
**Step 4**: Invocation of the chosen deity
Once the astral form is stable, it is time to invoke the chosen deity, such as the Greek goddess Athena for her wisdom or the Hindu goddess Saraswati for her knowledge and intuition. Chanting the deity's name and connecting with their essence, seek their guidance in strengthening one's psychic abilities.
**Step 5**: The Revelation of the Mystical Eye
As the invoked deity assists in the practitioner's quest, both the practitioner's astral body and the deity will focus their energies on opening the practitioner's third eye chakra, thus enhancing their intuition and psychic abilities.
**Step 6**: Return to the physical realm and conclusion
Upon completion of the transformation, the practitioner should express gratitude to the deity and will themselves back to their physical form. They must ground themselves by focusing on their breath and chakras once again before closing the ceremonial space and extinguishing the elemental symbols.

In summary, "The Rite of the Mystical Eye" is a comprehensive Magick ceremony that incorporates the four elemental symbols for grounding and harnessing natural energies, the activation, and energizing of the seven chakras for channeling divine energy, the utilization of astral projection for accessing higher dimensions, and the invocation of a chosen deity for guidance and assistance in achieving the desired personal transformation. By respecting the integrity of traditional occult principles and weaving these components together, the practitioner embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth, ultimately unlocking their full psychic potential.
