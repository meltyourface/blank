  1. Utilize domain-specific terminology, such as "energetic alignment" and "subconscious nourishment," to emphasize the focus on Affirmation of Life principles.
  
  2. Generate example specifics for each affirmation by incorporating the individual's unique sleep struggles, such as "As I lay my head down, my thoughts dissolve, and the pull of restful darkness enfolds me."

## I. Relaxation Stage Affirmations

1. As I enter into a serene state of relaxation, I am surrounded by the warm and supportive energy of my own subconscious, cradling me as I prepare for nourishing sleep.

2. As I breathe deeply and slowly, my energetic alignment gradually reconnects me with my innermost sanctuary of calm, unwinding from any tensions acquired throughout the day.

3. Like the fading light of day, my thoughts dissolve into the twilight, bringing forth a sense of inner tranquility like soft, undulating waves upon the shore.
 
### II. Deep Sleep Stage Affirmations

1. Submerged in the oceanic depths of restorative slumber, I am held and nourished by the deepest energetic currents of life, allowing my body and mind to align and rejuvenate.

2. As I drift into the velvety arms of deep sleep, I am gently cocooned by the nourishing blanket of my own subconscious, wrapped in the protective embrace of complete restoration.

3. My body, a sacred vessel of vibrant energy, surrenders to the profound stillness of the universe, allowing every cell to bathe in the rejuvenating waters of deep sleep.

### III. Dream State Affirmations

1. The dreamscape I enter is a sacred space of energetic communion, where my subconscious journeys to explore, heal, and expand my consciousness.

2. My inner guidance manifests through the symbolic language of my dreams, reconfiguring existing patterns and forging new pathways that lead to growth and self-discovery.

3. As I traverse the luminous landscapes of this ethereal realm, my spirit evolves and flourishes, weaving a tapestry of celestial wisdom and subconscious nourishment that transcends my waking life.
