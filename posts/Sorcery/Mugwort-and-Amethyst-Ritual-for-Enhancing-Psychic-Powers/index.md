Incantation: Atheris Arcanum Cognosco

Ritual Components:
1. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), freshly harvested or dried
2. Amethyst crystal, ideally with a natural point
3. Personal sacred space or altar, adorned with mystical symbols and items that represent psychic abilities and spiritual growth, such as the Ankh, the Eye of Horus, or the third eye
4. Ceremonial attire, consisting of a robe or other garments made of natural fibers in colors that resonate with the crown and third eye chakras (indigo, violet, or white)
5. **A chalice or cup filled with water infused with the essence of the Amethyst**
6. **A small bowl filled with crushed Mugwort**
7. **A mortar and pestle for grinding the Mugwort**
8. **Charcoal disk for burning the Mugwort**
9. **A lighter or matches**

Lunar Phase:
New Moon, symbolizing the awakening of psychic abilities and the expansion of spiritual wisdom.

Ritual Preparation:
1. Cleanse yourself and your ritual space, either with a ritual bath or by smudging with a cleansing herb, such as sage or Palo Santo.
2. Set up your personal sacred space or altar, arranging the mystical symbols and items, Amethyst, chalice, and bowl of crushed Mugwort.
3. Don your ceremonial attire and sit or stand comfortably in front of your sacred space.

Ritual Steps:
1. Close your eyes and take deep, slow breaths. Visualize violet and indigo energy enveloping your head and your third eye area.
2. Light the charcoal disk and wait until it's heated thoroughly. Then, carefully place it in the small bowl with the Mugwort.
3. Grind the Mugwort with the mortar and pestle, imbuing it with your intention to amplify psychic abilities. **Chant the incantation thrice**: "Atheris Arcanum Cognosco."
4. Sprinkle the ground Mugwort onto the charcoal disk. As it begins to smolder and release its essence, inhale the sacred smoke, allowing it to permeate your aura and subtly enhance your psychic senses.
5. Hold the Amethyst crystal in your hands, focusing on your intention, and chant the incantation thrice again: "Atheris Arcanum Cognosco."
6. Place the Amethyst crystal into the chalice filled with water, visualizing the crystal's energy infusing the water with its empowering essence.
7. Slowly sip the Amethyst-infused water, continuing to chant the incantation thrice more: "Atheris Arcanum Cognosco." Feel the essence coursing through your being, magnifying your intuition and psychic powers.
8. Spend a few moments in silence, absorbing the amplified energy and listening for any psychic impressions or guidance.
9. To conclude the ritual, offer thanks to the sacred elements and energies present. Slowly open your eyes and return to your daily life, carrying the heightened psychic abilities with you.

Remember to cleanse the Amethyst, sacred space, and any tools used regularly to maintain their potency and effectiveness. Practice this ritual periodically as needed to continually amplify and enhance your psychic abilities.
