Spell Name: Sigilbound Guardian Poppet

**Objective**: To create a powerful binding spell using a handcrafted poppet that prevents physical and emotional harm, harnesses protective energies, and utilizes personalized symbols, sigils, ingredients, and celestial timing for amplified potency.

Materials and Ingredients:
1. Poppet, handmade with natural fabric, preferably white or light blue
2. Sigil of Protection, personally designed or chosen
3. Thread or string in protective colors (white, silver, or black)
4. Herbs and crystals associated with protection (e.g., black tourmaline, amethyst, rosemary, sage)
5. Essential oils for protection (e.g., lavender, eucalyptus, cedarwood)
6. **Salt or black salt**
7. **White sage smudge stick or incense**
8. Candle (white, silver, or black) and a lighter
9. **Paper and pen**
10. Plate or tray, to hold the poppet and ingredients during the ritual

**Celestial Timing**: Perform the spell during the waning moon or on a Saturday, when Saturn's protective energies are at their strongest.

Instructions:

1. Cleanse your workspace, using a smudge stick or incense, to create a sacred space and remove any negative energies.

2. Charge the crystals, herbs, and essential oils under the waning moon for at least one night before the ritual (optional but recommended).

3. Crafting the Poppet:
   a. Stuff the poppet with the chosen herbs and crystals.
   b. Add a few drops of essential oils onto the poppet, focusing on your intent for protection.
   c. Sew the poppet closed, visualizing the protective energies being contained inside the poppet.

4. Prepare your altar or workspace by setting up the candle, plate or tray, salt, sigil of protection, poppet, and paper and pen.

5. Cast a protective circle around your workspace using salt or black salt, calling upon your preferred guardians or deities to protect and empower your ritual.

6. Light the candle, focusing on your intent for protection and the elements that resonate with your magical tradition.

7. Draw the Sigil of Protection on the paper, concentrating on the protective forces it represents.

8. Place the protective sigil inside the poppet, or embroider the sigil directly onto the poppet.

9. Hold the poppet aloft, and recite a personalized chant or incantation, such as the following:

  "By earth, air, fire, and sea, Spirits of protection, gather 'round me. With this poppet I create, A shield against both strife and hate. Sigil of protection now unveiled, May the poppet's power never fail. By the waning moon above, Enfold us in protection and love. As I weave, so mote it be!"

10. Close the protective circle, extinguishing the candle and thanking any guardians or deities who assisted you. Gently remove the salt from your workspace.

11. Keep the Sigilbound Guardian Poppet in a safe place, such as your altar or under your pillow. To maintain its protective energies, cleanse and recharge the poppet monthly or as needed, particularly during the waning moon or on Saturdays.

12. Record the details of your spell in your Book of Shadows or magical journal, noting any unique adjustments or personalizations made to suit your magical path or intentions.
