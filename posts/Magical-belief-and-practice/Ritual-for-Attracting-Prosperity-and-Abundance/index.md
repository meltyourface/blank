  6. Compose an incantation or chant to be recited while lighting the candle, invoking the flow of wealth and prosperity into your life.

  7. Develop a plan for visualizations and meditations to be performed throughout the candle-burning process, focusing on the manifestation of abundance.

  8. Determine the optimal length of time the ritual should be conducted and the best method for disposing of the ritual remains, ensuring that the energy released continues to work towards the desired outcome.

---**Step 1**: Timing the Ritual
Select a suitable lunar phase, day of the week, and planetary hour to conduct the ritual. Aim for a waxing moon, preferably on a Thursday, representing abundance and growth. Schedule the ritual during the planetary hour of Jupiter for amplified prosperity energies.
**Step 2**: Candle Color Correspondences
Choose a green or gold candle to symbolize wealth and abundance. A green candle represents growth and financial gain, while a gold candle is associated with wealth, success, and achievement.
**Step 3**: Anointing and Adorning
Anoint the candle with essential oils like cinnamon or patchouli and dress it in herbs such as basil or mint. Place citrine, pyrite, or clear quartz crystals nearby to amplify the energy of the ritual.
**Step 4**: Carve a Sigil or Symbol
Design a personalized sigil or symbol representing prosperity. Carve this sigil onto the candle, channeling your intention of attracting financial success during the carving process.
**Step 5**: Create a Ritual Space
Cleanse and consecrate the ritual space using sage or incense. Cast a protective circle around the area. Invoke the presence of abundance-associated deities or spiritual guides, such as Lakshmi or Hermes.
**Step 6**: Incantation or Chant
Compose a chant or incantation to be recited while lighting the candle. An example of an incantation could be: "As this candle burns, prosperity I earn, wealth and abundance, manifest in abundance."
**Step 7**: Visualization and Meditation
Focus on visualizations and meditations that center on the manifestation of abundance. Imagine wealth flowing into your life with ease as the candle burns, transforming the energy into tangible results.
**Step 8**: Ritual Length and Disposal
Determine the optimal length of time for the ritual based on the size of the candle and your personal preferences. Dispose of the ritual remains respectfully, either by burying them, placing them in a natural body of water, or releasing them to the wind, ensuring that the energy continues to work towards the desired outcome.
**Step 9**: Document the Process
Keep a record of the entire ritual for later reference or adaptation. Note any significant occurrences, insights, or manifestations that may happen during or after performing the ritual. This will allow you to refine the process, observe patterns, and track your progress in attracting prosperity and abundance into your life.
