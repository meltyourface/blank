To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, let us dissect the question first. We are asked to understand how the concept of Demiurgic oppression relates to three main areas:

1. Gnostic cosmology
2. Platonic philosophy
3. Psychological archetypes

Moreover, we need to consider the impact of these relationships on an individual's spiritual liberation and self-awareness journey. Let us explore each area and their interconnected relationships.

**Gnostic Cosmology**

Gnosticism is a religious and philosophical movement that emerged in the early Christian era, emphasizing the importance of gnosis (direct experiental knowledge) and spiritual enlightenment. Gnostic cosmology revolves around the cosmic struggle between good and evil, in which a divine spark is trapped in the material world, created and ruled by the Demiurge. The Demiurge, in Gnostic thought, is a lesser divine being that creates and governs the material world, obscuring the true divine nature and spiritual reality.

**Platonic Philosophy**

Platonic philosophy, founded by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, emphasizes a metaphysical dualism of an ideal realm (the world of Forms or Ideas) and the physical world in which we live. In this philosophy, the Demiurge can be seen as an architect or divine craftsman, who constructs the physical world according to the template of the eternal Forms. However, the material world only imperfectly mirrors the world of Forms, creating an inherent separation between the spiritual and physical aspects of existence.

**Psychological Archetypes**

Psychological archetypes, developed by Carl Gustav Jung, refer to recurring patterns, images, and themes that manifest in the human psyche, shaping our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Jung identified the archetypal figure of the Demiurge as a representation of human striving for self-awareness, spiritual liberation, and a reconciliation of opposite forces (such as light and darkness, spirit and matter). The Demiurge serves as an archetype of the ego, our sense of self, that yearns to transcend the limitations of the material world and connect with a higher divine reality.

Now, let's interconnect these three areas in the context of Demiurgic oppression.

**Interconnected Relationships between Gnostic Cosmology, Platonic Philosophy, and Psychological Archetypes**

The concept of Demiurgic oppression reflects a common theme that connects Gnostic cosmology, Platonic philosophy, and psychological archetypes: the struggle against a limiting force that obstructs the individual's spiritual enlightenment. In Gnostic cosmology, the Demiurge is the oppressive entity that entraps the divine spark within the material world. In Platonic philosophy, the Demiurge governs the imperfect, physical world that obstructs our access to the world of Forms and spiritual truth. In psychological archetypes, the Demiurge represents the ego that must overcome its material confines to achieve spiritual self-realization.

These interconnected relationships can shape an individual's spiritual liberation and self-awareness journey in the following ways:

1. Recognition of Demiurgic oppression: By understanding the concept of Demiurgic oppression within various philosophical and religious systems, the individual becomes aware of the limitations imposed by the material world and the necessity for spiritual growth and liberation.

2. Seeking transcendent knowledge: In response to this awareness, the individual embarks on a quest for gnosis (direct experiental knowledge), seeking to comprehend the truth beyond the material world's limitations and reconcile their spiritual and physical aspects.

3. Developing psychological integration: Through recognizing the interplay between archetypal forces within their psyche, the individual can achieve a level of psychological integration, facilitating a greater understanding of their spiritual nature and inner struggles.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the concept of Demiurgic oppression acts as a unifying philosophical and psychological force connecting Gnostic cosmology, Platonic philosophy, and psychological archetypes. This interconnectedness provides a deep understanding of how different thought systems interpret the perennial human struggle against limitations, both physical and psychological, to attain spiritual liberation and self-awareness. By recognizing these connections, an individual embarks on a journey of introspection and spiritual growth that transcends limitations, deepens self-awareness, and culminates in psychological and spiritual integration.
