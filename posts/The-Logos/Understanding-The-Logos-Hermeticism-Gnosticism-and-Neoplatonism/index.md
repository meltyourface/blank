In order to explore the relationships between Hermeticism, Gnostic cosmology, and Neoplatonism in the context of The Logos, it's essential first to understand the core principles of each esoteric tradition and how they collectively encompass the divine principle of reason and order. 

Hermeticism stems from the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure said to be the founder of all wisdom, science, and magic. The core of Hermeticism revolves around the concept of "as above, so below," which signifies that our physical world is a reflection of the divine or metaphysical plane, and there exists a correspondence between all things. In this tradition, The Logos represents the Divine Mind or Principle that underlies all of creation. Man's relationship with the divine is marked by the pursuit of understanding and wisdom through the study of these correspondences and unlocking the secrets of nature.

Gnostic cosmology, on the other hand, is rooted in early Christian mysticism and features a complex understanding of the creation of the world, in which a Supreme Being, the Monad, emanates lower beings called Aeons, which includes the Demiurge, the flawed creator of the material world. In this system, The Logos (referred to as the Word or Christ) is an Aeon responsible for bringing divine wisdom and knowledge of the true nature of reality to humanity as a path to spiritual transformation. This cosmic mission is an essential component of Gnostic salvation since it allows human beings to break free from the material reality shaped by the Demiurge, the imperfect creator, and ultimately reunite with the divine Monad.

Neoplatonism, a Greco-Roman philosophical school, stems from the teachings of Plotinus, who sought to synthesize Platonic metaphysics with monotheistic mysticism. Neoplatonism centers around the concept of the One, a transcendent source of all existence from which emanates an ordered hierarchy of being, descending from the spiritual realm of pure forms to the physical world of matter. Here, The Logos holds the role of an intermediary between the One and the material world. It functions as the creative power that shapes the material world according to the divine wisdom of the One. Neoplatonism views man's relationship with the divine as a return to the One via contemplation, purifying the soul, and gaining knowledge of our divine essence.

Upon examining the above descriptions, we can observe the significant commonalities and differences that pervade the three esoteric traditions. In all three systems, The Logos holds a central role as the embodiment of divine wisdom, order, and creative power, acting as the essential principle underlying creation as a whole. These principles accentuate man's pursuit of divine wisdom and knowledge in order to reach a more profound understanding of the world and culminate in spiritual transformation.

However, the differences are also striking. In Hermeticism, the emphasis is on achieving mastery over the natural world through understanding the correspondences, whereas in Gnostic cosmology, the goal is to escape the flawed material reality to reunite with the divine Monad. Neoplatonism is primarily concerned with the soul's return to the divine unity, thereby distancing itself from the purely mystical and esoteric elements found in Hermeticism and Gnostic cosmology.

In conclusion, the concepts of The Logos in Hermeticism, Gnostic cosmology, and Neoplatonism bear similarities in terms of representing divine wisdom, order, and creative power, which influences man's quest for knowledge and ultimate spiritual transformation. The differences that come into play are based on each tradition's understanding of the divine realm, the nature of the material world, and the path man must undertake to achieve spiritual enlightenment. By comparing these esoteric traditions, we gain insight into the multifaceted interpretations of The Logos and its essential role in shaping human spirituality throughout history.
