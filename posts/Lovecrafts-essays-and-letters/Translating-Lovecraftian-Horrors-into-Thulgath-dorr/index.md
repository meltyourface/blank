excerpt: Translate a passage from one of H.P. Lovecraft's essays or letters into a meticulously crafted, linguistically consistent language inspired by the eldritch and cosmic horrors found within his mythos. Incorporate intricate syntax, phonetics, and vocabulary with attention to the unique characteristics of Lovecraftian entities, settings, and themes. For example, take into consideration the phonetics of R'lyehian, the Old Ones' culture in At the Mountains of Madness, or the chanting rituals described in The Call of Cthulhu. Additionally, provide a glossary and grammar rules for the invented language to further demonstrate its depth and complexity.

For this task, I have chosen a passage from one of H.P. Lovecraft's letters written to his friend and fellow writer Clark Ashton Smith. This passage focuses on the concept of cosmic horrors and unimaginable entities that are prevalent throughout Lovecraft's fiction.

Original passage:

"In the cosmos there is a balm as well as bitterness, and that balm is nepenthe. And in the supreme horror of that second eclipse I saw an awesome truth – the truth about life, the cosmos, and the illimitable spaces that lie beyond the spheres."

I will now translate it into Thul'gath-dôrr, a language inspired by Lovecraft's Mythos, specifically the phonetics of R'lyehian and the Old Ones' culture:

Translated passage:

"Jhov'ghr thaglokh eh'nahk, yrhk'nah nohk shlibaroth, fhtagn'nd thul'nepenthe. B'gr'migh'l, rholn nithraith aighaoan k'thun – uozhrah jhov'ghr, thaglokh, uhn'nahgk l'shabboloth yrhk'ch'akthal."

**Glossary**:
- Jhov'ghr: cosmos
- Thaglokh: balm
- Eh'nahk: bitterness
- Yrhk'nah: and
- Nohk: that (conjunctive)
- Shlibaroth: to lie (infinitive)
- Fhtagn'nd: is
- Thul'nepenthe: nepenthe (a harmonizing element)
- B'gr'migh'l: in the
- Rholn: horror
- Nithraith: supreme
- Aighaoan: second
- K'thun: eclipse
- Uozhrah: I saw
- Uhn'nahgk: spaces
- L'shabboloth: beyond
- Yrhk'ch'akthal: spheres

Grammar rules of Thul'gath-dôrr:

1. Word order: Thul'gath-dôrr follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, but adpositions, like those indicating possession or location, can freely move.
2. Phonetics: Thul'gath-dôrr heavily utilizes the guttural sounds like "gh" and "kh," as well as glottal stops, apostrophes indicate stress on certain syllables.
3. Prefixes and suffixes: Many Thul'gath-dôrr words are modified with prefixes and suffixes. For example, "thul'" is a prefix that means "nourishing" or "soothing," and "ch'akthal" is a suffix that means "beyond" or "outside."
4. Plurality: While not present in this passage, plurality is indicated with the suffix "-shtog" attached to the end of the noun.
5. Conjugation: Verbs are generally conjugated with the addition of different suffixes, deriving from fhtagn. In the passage, "shlibaroth" is the infinitive of "to lie."
6. Gender: Thul'gath-dôrr does not utilize grammatical gender.
7. Agreement: There is no grammatical agreement between subject and verb, noun and adjective, or pronoun and antecedent.

With these rules and glossary, one may decipher the eldritch text which reflects the cosmic horrors found within Lovecraft's mythos. Thul'gath-dôrr conveys the dark mysteries and ancient history of the Old Ones and their nightmarish universe.
