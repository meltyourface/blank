The correct pair is: The Chariot is associated with triumph over obstacles and corresponds to the astrological sign of Cancer.

**Explanation**:

The Tarot is a diverse system full of symbols and meanings, and it is essential to understand these symbols in their proper context. In this case, there is a specific reference to the Arcanum, which refers to the hidden knowledge within the Tarot. The Tarot can be grouped into Major and Minor Arcana. The question refers to the Major Arcana, which deals with significant spiritual lessons and experiences.

The High Priestess represents intuition, mystery, and the subconscious mind, but it is not associated with Chesed in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Chesed represents mercy and benevolence, which is not an appropriate match for the High Priestess's attributes. Instead, the High Priestess is associated with the Kabbalistic sephira of Binah, representing understanding and intuition.

The Chariot signifies determination, control, and triumph over obstacles. It indeed corresponds to the astrological sign of Cancer, a water sign that represents nurturing qualities, sensitivity, and emotional strength. This combination of symbolism indicates the balance between heart and mind and the importance of overcoming challenges with resilience and compassion.

The Wheel of Fortune represents cycles, changes, and the unpredictability of life. However, it does not specifically correspond to the alchemical element of Air. Instead, the Wheel of Fortune is associated with the planet Jupiter, representing expansion, growth, and opportunity, emphasizing the reality that luck and fortune can change at any moment.

Lastly, the Tower symbolizes sudden upheaval, chaos, and transformative experiences. While the Tower's sudden impact could be interpreted as a magus's actions, it does not directly correspond to the mythological archetype. Rather than representing an individual like the Magus, the Tower signifies disruptive external events that can alter one's life path or shake foundational beliefs.

In summary, among the given options, The Chariot paired with the astrological sign of Cancer is the correct choice due to the clear association between the triumph over challenges and the astrological sign's nurturing and emotional properties.
