Here is an intricate, Arcanum-based ritual for thoroughly cleansing and energetically consecrating a newly acquired obsidian athame for enhancing its potency in ceremonial magick practices:

1. Preparation: Collect the following items - the obsidian athame, six quartz crystals, a bowl of water, a bowl of salt, a feather, a lighter or matches, and incense. Choose a time to perform the ritual when the moon is waxing or full to increase the power and energy of the athame. Set up a sacred space that resonates with you and serves as the appropriate atmosphere for invoking the elemental energies.

2. Cleansing: Light the incense using the lighter or matches to represent Air. Pass the obsidian athame through the incense smoke and say the following words: "By the breath of the winds, cleanse and purify this blade of obsidian."

Place the bowl of water in front of you, representing Water. Pass the athame through the water and say: "By the flowing waters, cleanse and purify this blade of obsidian."

Sprinkle some salt over the athame, representing Earth. As you do this, say: "By the fertile Earth, cleanse and purify this blade of obsidian."

Lastly, quickly pass the athame through the flame of a burning candle or a lighter, representing Fire. Do not touch the flame directly, just close enough for the element to be present. Say: "By the sacred flames, cleanse and purify this blade of obsidian."

3. Consecration: On the floor or a table, arrange the six quartz crystals in a hexagonal pattern. Place the athame in the center of the pattern. Facing the North, hold the bowl of salt in your hands and quietly invoke the element of Earth. Visualize the energy of the Earth connecting with the athame.

Turn towards the East. Hold the feather in your hands and invoke the element of Air. Visualize the energy of the Air connecting with the athame as it rests within the quartz crystal arrangement.

Facing the South, hold the lighter or candle, and invoke the element of Fire. Visualize the energy of Fire connecting with the athame.

Lastly, face towards the West. Hold the bowl of water in your hands and invoke the element of Water. Visualize the Water's energy connecting with the athame.

Once all elemental invocations are complete, return to the center of your sacred space. Stand over the athame and raise your hands above it, imagining a bright, glowing energy flowing from your hands into the obsidian blade.

4. Incantation: Speak the following original and captivating incantation with great conviction to solidify the athame's connection to the wielder and empower the ritual's overall efficacy:

"Obsidian blade, I bond thee to me,
As natural forces merge with thee,
Elemental powers now align,
Enhance your might to forever shine.

Earth, Air, Fire, and Water,
Unity now, our bond, the fifth quarter.
Connected to me, as I am to you,
In harmony's grasp, a bond so true.

By Magick's light and arcane command,
Empower this blade within my hand.
In sacred union, our fates entwine,
Obsidian athame, you are now mine."

5. Sealing: To conclude the ritual, gently press your thumb or a finger to the hilt of the athame, forming a strong bond between you and the blade. Sever the energetic space that you have created and ground the energies by sitting in silence for a few moments. Afterward, carefully store the obsidian athame and use it to enhance your ceremonial magick practices.
