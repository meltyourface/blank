Cultivated beauty and gave it birth.

For the gentle warmth and solace imbibed from her fortitude.
With open heart and healing hands, she mended the unseen,

Boundless care transcending species, no soul too small to tend,
To a love beyond words, our hearts unbend.

She walked amid the banners, a voice for the silenced,
With love and justice, her spirit forever balanced.
