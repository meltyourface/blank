## I. Preparation of Sacred Space

1. **Gather the necessary rare crystals and materials**:
   - Azurite: for enhancing psychic abilities and intuition
   - Black Tourmaline: for grounding and protection
   - Clear Quartz: for amplifying energies and intention
   - Selenite: for connecting to higher consciousness and spiritual realms
   - Moonstone: to honor the moon and enhance intuition

2. Arrange the crystals around the perimeter of a circle, starting with Azurite in the north, then clockwise: Black Tourmaline, Clear Quartz, Selenite, and Moonstone.

3. In the center of the circle, place a table with a white or silver cloth and draw the Sigil of Asyliansi, a sacred symbol representing the spiritual guidance in the esoteric, occult, and mental training methods of magic.

4. Carefully draw seven interconnected hexagons on the cloth, representing the seven realms of magical knowledge. Within each hexagon, draw distinct ancient symbols of esoteric wisdom, such as the Ankh, Ouroboros, and Eye of Horus.

### II. Invocation Ritual

1. Stand in the center of the circle, facing north.

2. Begin the advanced visualization technique by focusing on a bright, golden light surrounding you, imbuing you with the mystical knowledge necessary for the ritual.

3. **Perform the complex hand gestures in a specific sequence**:
   - Touch your thumb to each fingertip, starting with the pinky and moving to the index finger, symbolizing the flow of knowledge from the outer realms to your core.
   - Lift your hands above your head, palms facing outward, and then bringing them down in a circular motion, affirming your connection to both the celestial and terrestrial worlds.
   - Cross your arms over your chest, touching your opposite shoulders, signifying the intersection of all magical elements.

4. **Chant the following invocation in the obscure magical language of Runeic**:
   "Agmartir veldr kysarti,
    Frashti kalmendi zyral,
    Yuliari brasta fylgja,
    Verthandi skratla spirati."

Translation:
   "Winds of wisdom, carry my call,
    Tides of knowledge, in you I fall,
    Guide of secrets, heed my plea,
    Spirit of mysteries, walk with me."

5. Remain still and focused, embracing the stillness before the spirit guide emerges, offering expertise in the esoteric, occult, and mental training methods of magic.

6. Once the spirit guide appears, express gratitude and ask for their guidance in mastering the hidden arts.

7. Conclude the ritual by offering a token of appreciation, such as a small amulet or coin, then bid farewell to the spirit guide, releasing them back to their realm.

8. Cleanse and close the sacred space, thanking the elemental energies and the rare crystals for assisting in the ritual.
