To address this knowledge challenge, it is first crucial to examine the individual roles and contributions of Eliphas Levi, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and Pico della Mirandola to the Western esoteric tradition, as well as their influence on the learned clergy of their time. Secondly, we must explore the interconnectedness of their works in relation to the development of modern occult thought. 

Eliphas Lévi (1810-1875), born Alphonse Louis Constant, was a French occultist and ceremonial magician who played a significant role in shaping modern Western occultism. His primary contributions lie in two of his ground-breaking works: "Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie" (1854-1856) and "Histoire de la Magie" (1860), which sought to synthesize various occult practices and ideas, including Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Tarot. Lévi revived the concept of the Astral Light, which he believed to be a primary force underlying all magic, and introduced the Baphomet – a symbol of the unity between good and evil – as an emblem of occult wisdom. Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of personal spiritual development, asserting that mastery of one's own inner world is a prerequisite for magical proficiency. Lévi's work greatly influenced the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Ordo Templi Orientis, and many occultists who followed, such as Aleister Crowley.

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535) was a German polymath, physician, and highly influential occult writer who contributed to the fields of theology, philosophy, and law, as well as the natural sciences and alchemy. His most notable work, "De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres" (1531), was a monumental three-volume treatise on the occult that covered the breadth of Renaissance magic, including celestial (planetary) magic, ceremonial magic, talismanic magic, and elemental magic. Agrippa's work sought to reconcile the seemingly conflicting areas of the natural sciences, mathematics, and the esoteric arts by demonstrating that they all stemmed from a single source – divine wisdom. Most importantly, Agrippa's writings notably influenced figures such as Paracelsus, John Dee, and Giordano Bruno, who shaped the Western esoteric tradition through their own works and practices.

Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) was an Italian philosopher and humanist who contributed to the Renaissance Platonism movement while also engaging in dialogue with Kabbalists, Neoplatonists, and Hermeticists. He is best known for his "Oration on the Dignity of Man" (1486), a manifesto in which he argues that humanity occupies a unique position in the cosmos due to its ability to ascend or descend spiritually based on the use of its free will. Pico's syncretic fusion of Christian, Neoplatonic, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic thought greatly impacted later Renaissance and Western esoteric traditions, introducing the notion that divine knowledge could be accessed through a variety of intellectual and philosophical pursuits.

Each of these figures contributed to the development of Western esotericism in profound and lasting ways, and their ideas often intersected and influenced one another across time and geographical boundaries. Some common themes and intersecting ideas in their works are:

1. The synthesis and reconciliation of various esoteric traditions (i.e., Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism) in the pursuit of a harmonious and unified system of thought.
2. The belief in a single source or divine wisdom underlying all occult knowledge, where esoteric traditions provide complementary keys to unlocking divine truths.
3. The emphasis on personal spiritual development and inner transformation as prerequisites for magical proficiency or access to divine wisdom.
4. The influence of their work on subsequent esoteric thinkers, practitioners, and institutions (e.g., the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Theosophical Society, and various ceremonial magicians).

In summary, Eliphas Lévi, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and Pico della Mirandola each played essential roles in shaping Western occult thought and practices. Their contributions to the field of learned clergy significantly influenced the development and interconnectedness of various esoteric traditions in the Western world. The key themes and ideas present in their works, such as the synthesis of esoteric traditions, the pursuit of divine wisdom, and the importance of personal spiritual development, continue to resonate in the modern practice of occultism to this day.
