To fully explicate the nexus between Friedrich Nietzsche's concepts of 'death of God' and 'Übermensch,' and their relation to the principles of occultism and esotericism, especially in regard to the Tarot cards The Fool and The Magician, a comprehensive investigation is warranted. Nietzsche's perspectives on education and self-discovery will also be considered to deepen the understanding of this connection.

First, let's decode the concepts of 'death of God' and 'Übermensch':

1. **Death of God**: For Nietzsche, the 'death of God' symbolizes the demise of established religious and moral authorities, particularly in Christianity. With the progress of science and reason, humanity started questioning the validity of the religious dogmas and divine existence. This led to a spiritual vacuum and a moral crisis that had to be addressed by the creation of new values and the celebration of human potential.

2. **Übermensch**: The Übermensch, or "Overman", refers to Nietzsche's idealized human who transcends the conventional and even nihilistic values to create their own way of life, morality, and meaning. This individual embraces the reality of a godless world and strives for self-actualization, often through artistic, intellectual, and ethical achievements.

Now, let's elucidate the principles of occultism and esotericism:

Occultism and esotericism are streams of philosophy and mysticism that aim to explore the hidden, arcane, and mysterious aspects of the cosmos and the human psyche. These belief systems posit that the keys to unveiling the secrets of the universe and individual transformation lie in experiential wisdom, inner growth, and self-discovery, often through rituals, symbolism, and meditative practices.

The Fool and The Magician Tarot cards carry idiosyncratic symbolism that correlates with Nietzsche's ideas:

1. **The Fool**: The Fool card represents the beginning of a journey, one that requires a leap of faith and embraces the unknown. It symbolizes innocence, spontaneity, and potential, just like the uncertainties that humanity faces in the wake of the death of God. This aligns with Nietzsche's urging that individuals embark on their own quests for meaning and self-improvement.

2. **The Magician**: The Magician card embodies the principles of skill, resourcefulness, and creativity, mirroring the Nietzschean Übermensch. The Magician is a master of their domain and has the power to shape their reality, resemblant of the Übermensch who creates their own values and meaning in life.

In the sphere of education and self-discovery, Nietzsche championed individualism, critical thinking, and self-exploration. He believed that the traditional education system fosters conformity and inhibits self-discovery. Nietzsche conceived education as an instrument to cultivate free spirits capable of challenging societal norms and attaining self-mastery, akin to the journey of The Fool and the mastery of The Magician.

In conclusion, the concepts of 'death of God' and 'Übermensch' are closely related to the principles of occultism and esotericism as exemplified by the Tarot cards The Fool and The Magician. The death of God signifies the launch of an individual's journey into the unknown, mirroring The Fool's leap of faith. Conversely, the Übermensch embodies the mastery and resourcefulness of The Magician, who shapes their reality in a godless world.

Nietzsche's theories on education and self-discovery are deeply intertwined with these ideas, championing a quest for self-mastery beyond societal limitations, much like the meta-narrative of The Fool and The Magician in the esoteric Tarot system. The fusion of these themes underlines the importance of individualism, creativity, and self-transformation in the face of existential crises.
