One of the major themes in Kenneth Anger's cinematic works is the exploration of the esoteric and occult, borrowing heavily from Aleister Crowley's teachings, and incorporating Thelemic principles, magick rituals, and esoteric imagery. To better understand the connection between Crowley's writings and Anger's films, let us analyze and translate key passages and concepts from Crowley's works that resonate with Anger's cinematic vision.

1. The Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis):

Key Passage: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will." (AL I:40, I:57)

Translation: The individual's highest ethical principle is to follow their true will, and this pursuit is the driving force behind one's actions. Love is the basis for the law but must be guided by one's will.

Interpretation and Commentary: This central tenet of Thelema can be seen throughout Anger's works, particularly in "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome" and "Lucifer Rising." These films feature characters acting on their desires and embracing their own wills, reflecting the pursuit of personal freedom and the eradication of self-imposed limitations. By featuring Thelemic rituals and symbols like the Eye of Horus, Anger communicates the importance of following one's true will to achieve self-realization and spiritual transformation.

2. Magick in Theory and Practice:

Key Passage: "Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will." (Book 4, Part III, Chapter I)

Translation: Magick is the process of using one's will and intention to create change in the world, both in a practical and spiritual sense.

Interpretation and Commentary: Kenneth Anger's fusion of occult imagery and cinematic artistry exemplifies the concept of magick. Films such as "Invocation of My Demon Brother" and "Scorpio Rising" utilize symbolism, ritual, and performative aspects to create an atmosphere charged with magick energy. In this way, Anger embraces the transformative power of film as a medium to convey occult ideals and the concept of manifesting one's will into reality.

3. The Book of Lies:

Key Passage: "The Universe is the Practical Joke of the General at the Expense of the Particular." (Chapter 51)

Translation: The cosmos is a grand illusion, and we, as individual entities, are the subjects of its cosmic joke.

Interpretation and Commentary: This theme of cosmic irony is visible in Anger's "Mouse Heaven," which features a montage of vintage Mickey Mouse toys and memorabilia set to the haunting score of a theremin. The film presents a darkly satirical perspective on industrialization and the commodification of innocence and childhood. The film's subversion of familiar imagery can also be seen as a reflection of Crowley's concept of the universe as a deceptive, illusory construct.

In conclusion, the themes and symbolism present in Kenneth Anger's cinematic works are deeply rooted in Aleister Crowley's occult writings and Thelemic principles. Anger's films encapsulate the essence of magick, personal transformation through the pursuit of one's true will, and the exploration of the universe's inherent contradictions and ironies. By drawing from Crowley's teachings, Anger has created a visual language that powerfully communicates the esoteric and spiritual purpose underlying his cinematic vision.
