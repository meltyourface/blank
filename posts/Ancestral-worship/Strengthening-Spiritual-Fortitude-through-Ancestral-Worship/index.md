Answer: Strengthening one's spiritual fortitude and protection against external forces

**Explanation**: Ancestral worship has been practiced in various cultures and occult traditions across the globe for centuries. It is essential for many reasons, one of the foremost being strengthening one's spiritual fortitude and protection against external forces. 

Ancestral worship is the veneration of deceased relatives, honoring their memory and recognizing their continued influence in our lives. It aims to maintain their connection to the living and preserve their memory. While some may argue that wealth attraction, negative interference prevention, and guidance toward goals are essential aspects of ancestral worship, they are not its primary purpose within most occult traditions.

The primary function of ancestral worship in occult practices is to provide a spiritual anchor to ensure one's continued connection to the family lineage. It promotes the flow of generational wisdom and knowledge from ancestors to descendants, helping to fortify one's spiritual being against potential outside influences that may be harmful. By honoring and connecting with ancestors, one can strengthen their spiritual immune system and draw upon the reservoir of ancestral knowledge and strength in times of need.

This connection is exemplified in various occult practices and traditions. For example, in African and African diasporic spiritual Cosmologies, such as Ifa, Vodou, and Palo Mayombe, the ancestral spirits are often referred to as the "Egun" or "Nkisi" respectively and can be accessed through rituals, prayers, and offerings to receive guidance, protection, and blessings. In the Western occult, ancestors are sometimes evoked in ceremonies and grimoire traditions to help the practitioner navigate their spiritual journey and keep them safe from hostile forces.

Additionally, maintaining and nurturing the connection to one's ancestors creates an ongoing, reciprocal relationship. As practitioners honor their ancestors, ancestors, in turn, provide a protective layer of energy around the practitioner, shielding them from negative influences or malevolent energies.

In conclusion, ancestral worship is an essential element of many occult practices. It focuses on strengthening one's spiritual fortitude and protection against external forces. While there are indeed aspects of attracting wealth, avoiding negative interference, and achieving personal goals, its primary context is based around building spiritual connections and fortitude within the practitioner.
