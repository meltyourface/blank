description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Witches' Tools, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Craft an incantation centered on mending physical or emotional wounds, drawing upon the mystical powers of the goddess and her traditional epithets. Incorporate elements such as the use of a white candle, moon symbols, and the goddess's renowned aspects as the Mother, Maiden, and Crone. The incantation should effectively utilize rhyming verse, repetition, and alliteration for enhanced potency. Furthermore, consider enchanting a specific Witches' Tool, such as an athame or a chalice, to channel the energies of the incantation more effectively.

Incantation:

By the power of the Triple-Faced One,
Mother, Maiden, Crone, I summon thee;
Through darkest pain and morning's sun,
Draw forth your power, unite as Three.

By the light of the lunar sphere,
With symbols old, and shadows dance;
Heal the wound, dispel the fear,
Reveal thy love in every glance.

A white candle doth now burn,
Purity's fire to light the way;
The world below and stars above,
Turn heav'nly gaze to bless this day.

In circles round, the moon we draw,
A sacred charm, her light reflects;
Each phase a symbol of your law,
Illuminating what connects.

An athame, or chalice forged,
We seek enchantment from thy grace;
Infuse this tool with power surged,
By energies forever traced.

With rhyming verse, I call thee near,
Each repetition binds your might;
Through alliteration we shall hear,
The potency within this rite.

Sacred Trinity, Ancient Goddess Whole,
Channel thy gifts, restore and mend;
One mind, one body, one brightened soul,
From all directions begin to tend.

Mother, Maiden, Crone, together in grace,
With this incantation, you have been hailed;
Heal thy wounds, in love embrace,
Mending the heart and spirit unveiled.

By the Triple-Faced One and by my will,
May this be done, so mote it be;
Power abounds, as I stand still,
In me, this incantation forever, shall set free.
