To craft a potent remedial enchantment for alleviating anxiety, we will use the following ingredients, selected for their harmonious blend of herbs and their individual magical properties and intrinsic energies:

1. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) - Soothing
2. Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) - Tranquility
3. Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) - Reducing stress

Follow these steps to construct the enchantment with focused intent and energy:

1. Begin by clearing and purifying your workspace. Light a white candle and some incense (such as sage or sandalwood) to cleanse the atmosphere and create a serene ambiance.

2. On a piece of parchment or paper, write a brief statement of your intention, stating that the purpose of the enchantment is to alleviate anxiety, and manifest peace and calm. Place the parchment beneath the candle.

3. Hold each of the herbs individually in your hands, focusing your thoughts on their specific magical properties and imbuing them with your intention. Visualize the energy of the herbs resonating with the energy of your intention, creating a harmonious blend that will work in unison to soothe anxiety.

4. **In a mortar and pestle, place equal parts of lavender, chamomile, and lemon balm. Crush and mix the herbs together while chanting a spell to imbue the blend with your intention**:

   "Lavender, calm my mind,
    Chamomile, peace I'll find,
    Lemon Balm, stress release,
    In this blend, anxiety cease."

5. Once the herbs are well-blended, transfer the mixture to a small pouch or container, ideally made of natural materials such as cotton or glass.

6. Hold the container or pouch in your hands and visualize a soft, calming light surrounding it, infusing it further with your focused intent and energy.

7. **Seal the enchantment by reciting the following incantation**:

   "By the power of Earth and Air,
    By the force of Fire and Water,
    United, aligned, and brought to bear,
    Set forth this spell, let none falter."

8. Close the enchantment session by extinguishing the white candle and giving thanks to any deities, spirits, or energies you've called upon.

To use the enchanted herb blend, you can brew it as a tea, place it in a sachet under your pillow, or gently simmer it in an oil diffuser. Once you have completed this ritual, your crafted remedial enchantment will provide relief from anxiety, soothe the mind, and promote a sense of inner peace and calm to whoever uses it.
