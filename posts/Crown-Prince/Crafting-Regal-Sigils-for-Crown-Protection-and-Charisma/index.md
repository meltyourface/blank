In order to craft sophisticated sigils tailored to the pursuits of the Crown Prince, we will draw upon a myriad of esoteric techniques and arcane knowledge to create powerful talismanic devices. These sigils will be focused on promoting royal protection, mastery of diplomacy, and enhancement of regal charisma.

1. Sigil of Royal Protection:
For this sigil, we'll combine the Crown Prince's initials with the shape of an unyielding shield. Incorporate the symbol of a rampant lion, representing the strength and courage of the royal bloodline. Surround the shield with a border of intricate knotwork, symbolizing the interconnectedness of the royal lineage. Finally, add a radiant orb at the top of the shield to signify divine protection from above.

2. Sigil of Diplomatic Mastery:
Begin by inscribing the Crown Prince's initials within a circle, symbolizing the unity and completion of diplomatic endeavors. Overlay a hexagram, representing balance and harmony between opposing forces. Intertwine the hexagram with an infinity symbol, representing the eternal pursuit of peaceful resolutions. Lastly, incorporate a pair of linked hands, symbolizing successful negotiation, collaboration, and friendship between nations.

3. Sigil of Regal Charisma:
For this sigil, enscribe the Crown Prince's initials within a golden sun, which represents the radiant and compelling presence of royalty. Integrate the Eye of Providence, symbolizing divine guidance, wisdom, and insight into the hearts of others. Add a flourishing peacock feather, emblematic of confidence and charisma, to frame and accentuate the central design. Finally, surround the sigil with a border of laurel leaves, symbolizing victory, glory, and achievement.

As you complete each sigil, invoke the power of ancient royal lineages to charge these talismanic devices. To do this, perform a ritualistic ceremony, calling upon the spirits of noble ancestors and aligning yourself with their energies. Meditate on the desired outcomes, focusing intently on royal protection, diplomatic prowess, and regal charisma, while allowing the sigils to absorb the potent energies.

Over time, continue to experiment with intricate combinations of sacred geometry, mystical symbols, and layers of meaning. As you gain deeper understanding and mastery of these sigils, their power will grow, reflecting the complexity and illustriousness of the royal bloodline.

These sigils, imbued with the objectives of the Crown Prince and charged with the energies of ancient royal lineages, will serve as powerful tools in upholding and enhancing the prestige and sovereignty of the throne.
