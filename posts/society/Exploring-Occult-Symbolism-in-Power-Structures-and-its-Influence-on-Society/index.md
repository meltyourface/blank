To thoroughly examine the relationship between occult symbolism within societal power structures and their influence on collective consciousness and the human experience, we must first define and delve into the key concepts involved. These concepts include the occult and esoterica, symbolism, societal power structures (governments, media, and global financial institutions), collective consciousness, and the human experience. In doing so, we will take into account historical context, esoteric knowledge, and current manifestations.

The occult is defined as knowledge of the hidden or secret, and esoterica refers to specialized knowledge that is intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with special (or secret) interest or training. Occult symbolism, therefore, refers to the use of symbols containing hidden meanings and messages which can be decoded by those who possess the adequate knowledge or training.

Societal power structures refer to the organizations and institutions that have the ability to influence and control multiple aspects of society. In this case, we are focusing on governments, media, and global financial institutions as central examples of such structures. The influence these structures exert can have significant implications for the collective consciousness (shared beliefs, ideas, and moral attitudes that operate as a unifying force within society) and the human experience (the feelings, actions, and thoughts of individuals as they navigate their lives).

Understanding the historical context of occult symbolism, its use can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Greeks, who employed symbols as a means of communication between the elite and initiates, as well as to exert influence over their societies. Kings, priests, and secret societies made use of this hidden knowledge to retain power, control, and influence over the masses.

As time progressed, so too did the use of occult symbolism, weaving its way into various religious and spiritual traditions, secret societies such as the Freemasons and Rosicrucians, and even mainstream art and architecture. In fact, occult symbolism can be seen in the layout of significant cities, including Paris and Washington D.C., with the arrangement of streets and monuments forming hidden patterns and meanings.

Moving to the influence of occult symbolism within specific societal power structures, let's address each one individually:

1. **Governments**: Occult symbols have been employed within governments throughout history, primarily to establish a sense of authority, legitimacy, and connection to the divine. National symbols, such as seals and mottos, often hold hidden meanings for those "in the know," and are used to communicate messages and goals of the ruling class to other insiders. Furthermore, the use of occult symbolism serves to condition the masses to accept the power structures in place.

2. **Media**: The media, particularly in the form of news and entertainment, frequently utilizes occult symbolism as a way to influence public opinion and brainwash the masses. Symbols can be seen in popular movies, music videos, and advertising, with the intent to manipulate the collective consciousness by promoting certain ideas and desires, as well as to desensitize the population to certain phenomena or conditions.

3. **Global Financial Institutions**: These institutions, like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, have the power to control economies, and thus people's lives, by controlling the flow of currency and global financial markets. Occult symbolism in these institutions often takes the form of logos, as seen on currency notes, and the architecture of their buildings. The use of symbolism may work to connote authority, exclusivity, and the unyielding power these institutions hold.

These hidden elements in societal power structures have a profound impact on the collective consciousness and the human experience. By controlling and manipulating images and ideas that permeate society through occult symbolism, these institutions have the ability to shape our thoughts, desires, and behaviors, thus maintaining and solidifying their control over the population.

In conclusion, the relationship between occult symbolism within societal power structures and its influence on collective consciousness and the human experience is multifaceted and complex. Throughout history, this symbolism has allowed governments, media, and global financial institutions to exert control over the masses by embedding hidden meanings and messages within their symbols. In doing so, they shape the collective consciousness and human experience, maintaining the control and authority these power structures hold. As initiates and students of esoteric knowledge, it is vital to recognize and understand this enduring influence to further our own journey towards deeper insights and understanding.
