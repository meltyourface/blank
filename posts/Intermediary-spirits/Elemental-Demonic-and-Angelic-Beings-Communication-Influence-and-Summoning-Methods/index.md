2. **Characteristics & Attributes**: Angels are usually depicted as benevolent, wise, and protective entities, possessing a great purity of essence. Their hierarchical distinctions range from Archangels and Seraphim at the top, followed by Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Virtues, Powers, Principalities, and Guardian Angels. Each rank has unique characteristics and roles within the celestial hierarchy.

3. **Ability Spectra**: Angels' abilities typically involve healing, guidance, and protection. They are also known to wield immense power in the furtherance of good and the restraint of evil forces.

4. **Communication Methods**: Angels often communicate through dreams and visions, subtle energetic impressions, or through synchronistic events.

### II. Demonic Beings

1. **Origins**: Demonic beings are believed to be fallen angels, primordial chaos entities, or manifestations of mankind's darkest fears and desires.

2. **Characteristics & Attributes**: Demons are typically malevolent, deceitful, and manipulative beings who seek to corrupt or control those who come into contact with them. Hierarchical distinctions in demonic realms may vary, but some common classifications include dukes, kings, princes, and presidents, each with their own legions of lesser demons.

4. **Communication Methods**: Demons may communicate through possessions, channeling, evocations, or through dreams and visions.

5. **Influence on Practitioners**: Those who seek to make contact or work with demonic entities can risk corruption, possession, or harm. However, some practitioners attempt to gain knowledge, power, or influence by binding or making deals with these entities.
