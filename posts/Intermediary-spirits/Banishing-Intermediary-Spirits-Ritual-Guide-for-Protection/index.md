Introduction to the Expulsion of Intermediary Spirits

Intermediary spirits reside in a realm between the physical and the spiritual, acting as influential entities in our world. While they can have positive or negative intentions, this guide focuses on the removal of malevolent spirits wreaking havoc, possessing individuals, or disturbing the balance within a space.

In this in-depth guide, we will cover a series of specialized rituals, each targeting the expulsion of Intermediary spirits. The rituals include summoning protective entities, utilizing ritual tools and symbols, and performing complex ceremonial chants. Each ritual will be illustrated with case study examples, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Ritual 1: The Invocation of the Guardian Deity

Guardian deities act as our protectors and can help us banish harmful spirits. This ritual invokes the Guardian deity with an offering and recitation of sacred texts.

1. ****Prepare the area****: Cleanse the space using a smudge stick of sage or a mixture of salt and water.

2. ****Create a sacred circle****: Utilize a compass to draw a circle large enough for you to sit in, marking the four cardinal directions.

3. ****Place the following items around you within the circle****: 
   - A white or silver candle in the east (for illumination and purity)
   - A thurible containing frankincense or myrrh in the south (for protection)
   - A bowl of saltwater in the west (for cleansing)
   - An ankh or other protective symbol at the north (for grounding and stability)

4. Positions yourself at the center of the circle and begin meditation. Dig deep into the roots of your soul, connecting with your guardian deity.

5. Write an invocation asking for the deity to protect you and assist in the expulsion of the malevolent spirit. After finishing your plea, read it aloud.

6. Present the deity with a small offering such as incense, wine, or crystals.

Case Study:

An individual in Louisiana believed they were experiencing malevolent hauntings. They performed this ritual and invoked their guardian deity, the ancient Egyptian goddess Isis. Following the Invocation of the Guardian Deity, the hauntings ceased, and the person no longer felt threatened.

Ritual 2: The Banishing Pentagram with Enochian Chants

This powerful banishing ritual involves the use of a Banishing Pentagram with Enochian chants to cast out malevolent spirits.

1. Inscribe a large banishing pentagram on a piece of parchment paper, using a consecrated pen filled with ink infused with protective oils (such as sandalwood or frankincense).

2. Place the parchment at the center of a clean, purified, and protected ritual space (such as the sacred circle from Ritual 1).

3. **Light four black or white candles (for protection) and burn frankincense or myrrh in a thurible while chanting the Enochian names of the four elemental archangels**:
  
   - ARAL (Air, associated with Eastern Quadrant)
   - ThRShRQ (Fire, associated with Southern Quadrant)
   - SHADDa√Ø (Water, associated with Western Quadrant)
   - ELOHIVM (Earth, associated with Northern Quadrant)

4. Continue chanting, focusing your energy on summoning the archangels to banish the Intermediary spirit.

Case Study:

A family from Connecticut experienced poltergeist activity centered around their youngest child. They sought help from a knowledgeable practitioner, who performed this banishing pentagram ritual with Enochian chants. The activity soon halted, and the child returned to normal behavior.

Ritual 3: The Seven-Day Expulsion

This prolonged expulsion ritual involves a week's worth of daily ritual work to drive out a stubborn Intermediary spirit.

1. **Prepare a ritual space that includes the following**:
  
   - A banishing pentagram drawn on the floor
   - An offering bowl for the guardian deity
   - A protective circle enclosing the space

2. Each day, perform the rituals described in this guide, invoking the guardian deity and the four elemental archangels.

3. On the final day, after invoking the divine protectors, chant a complex banishing incantation, written or chosen to reflect your intentions and power.

4. Close the ritual by thanking the spiritual entities and removing all traces of the ritual symbols, tools, and materials.

Case Study:

In the Netherlands, a practitioner faced a powerful Intermediary spirit that couldn't be banished with simpler methods. They performed the Seven-Day Expulsion with dedication and secured their space. The presence dissipated, never returning.

Conclusion

The expulsion of Intermediary spirits is a vital aspect of esoteric practices, ensuring a balanced and secure environment. By mastering these specialized rituals, practitioners can confidently deal with malevolent entities and maintain harmony within their physical and spiritual worlds.
