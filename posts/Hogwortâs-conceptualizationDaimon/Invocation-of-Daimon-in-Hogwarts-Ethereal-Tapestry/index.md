In the whispers of moonlit shade,
Where the shadows of Hogwortâ€™s are made,
I call upon the celestial tide,
To bring forth my daimon, my guide.

Spirits of ether, hear my pleas,
As stardust weaves through immortal seas,
Unravel the lineage of ancient ties,
That from the cosmic vault arise.

Astral parchment, pen of light,
Inscribe my invocation's rite,
Daimon, beacon of arcane might,
Embolden me on this sacred night.

With stones of wisdom, roots divine,
Through symbols of my bloodline entwine,
In my heart, the key shall bear,
For daimon to watch, empathize, and care.

Elevated essence bound within,
Resonate with elements nurtured by kin,
Draw strength from fire's warming breath,
Embrace the wisdom of air's intellect.

Caressed by water, the depths of lore,
Grounded in earth, our hearts' rapport,
Magical forces, energies dance,
Unveiling daimon's mystic stance.

Honor the gifts of spectral grace,
By thy breath, I shall embrace,
Hogwortâ€™s ethereal tapestry,
Entwined with my daimon, forever be.
