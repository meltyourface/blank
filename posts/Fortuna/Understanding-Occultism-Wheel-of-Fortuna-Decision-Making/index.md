To begin our exploration of the interconnectedness between the concepts of Fortuna, decision-making, and the relationship with the divine in occultism, we need to understand the basic definitions and meanings of these terms. 

Fortuna, or the Wheel of Fortune, represents the cyclical nature of life's ups and downs. In the context of occultism, it symbolizes the ever-changing nature of our lives, guided by external forces as well as our decisionsâ€”blending the concepts of fate and free will. Decision-making, as the term implies, involves the process of making choices, which forms an essential part of life. The divine, in this context, relates to the belief in higher powers or beings that might exert influence or guidance over human affairs, possessing superior knowledge and wisdom.

With these definitions in mind, let's examine the interconnectedness between these concepts and how an initiate's understanding may lead to personal growth and spiritual transcendence.

Firstly, the Wheel of Fortune is intricately connected to the decision-making process. As we are faced with various circumstances in life, we are called upon to make decisions accordingly. These decisions have the potential to advance us toward our goals or set us back. The wheel, constantly spinning, highlights the importance of timing and making decisions that are aligned with the flow of life. The more one understands the influence of the wheel on their life, the better prepared they are to make decisions that are in harmony with the life's ebbs and flows.

Secondly, the concept of the divine plays a crucial role in understanding the Wheel of Fortune and decision-making in occultism. In this belief system, higher beings can influence the course of our lives, assisting us in making choices and helping us learn vital lessons for spiritual growth. The divine guidance is often subtle, requiring keen intuition, meditation, and reflection to feel its gentle nudging toward balance and alignment with life's shifting rhythms.

Now that we have established the interconnectedness between these three concepts, let's discuss how an initiate's understanding of these principles may lead to personal growth and spiritual transcendence.

By acknowledging the influence of Fortuna in guiding the fluctuations in life and understanding its impact on decision-making, the initiate develops the ability to synchronize their actions with the larger patterns. This enhanced awareness allows them to make better choices and adjust their decision-making strategies accordingly, resulting in more balanced and harmonious living.

Furthermore, cultivating a deeper relationship with the divine enables the initiate to tap into a reservoir of wisdom, guidance, and support. This divine connection can lead the initiate towards greater understanding of their true nature and purpose, fostering personal growth and deepening their relationship with the cosmos.

Consequently, the initiate's journey towards spiritual transcendence is a result of embracing the Wheel of Fortune's teachings, refining decision-making abilities, and nurturing their connection with the divine. Through embracing these essential concepts, the initiate transcends the limitations of their ego, embodying a higher state of consciousness and unity with the divine.

In summary, the key themes and ideas explored in the interconnectedness of Fortuna, decision-making, and the relationship with the divine in occultism are:

1. The Wheel of Fortune symbolizes the ever-changing nature of life and the ability to balance fate and free will in decision-making.
2. Developing an understanding of the wheel's influence on life allows the initiate to make better decisions and synchronize their actions with life's overwhelming patterns.
3. Cultivating a divine connection fosters personal growth and deepens the initiate's sense of purpose and wisdom.
4. Spiritual transcendence is achieved through embracing the teachings of the Wheel of Fortune, refining decision-making skills, and nurturing the divine relationship, ultimately leading to a higher state of consciousness and unity with the cosmos.
