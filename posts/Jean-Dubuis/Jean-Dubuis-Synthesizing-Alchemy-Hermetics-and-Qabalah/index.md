  Jean Dubuis was born on October 29, 1919, in France, and lived until April 6, 2010. He was an influential teacher, philosopher, and practitioner of occult, alchemical, and esoteric traditions. Throughout his life, Dubuis authored several celebrated works on the subjects of alchemy, hermeticism, and Qabalah. His most prominent contributions include three main courses: "The Fundamentals of Esoteric Knowledge," "Spagyrics," and "Qabalah."
  
  Prominent influences, sources, and manuscripts:
  
  1. Alchemy:
  Some primary texts that shaped Dubuis' alchemical practice were: 
  - The Aurora Consurgens, a treatise attributed to St. Thomas Aquinas
  - Theatrum Chemicum, a comprehensive collection of alchemical texts compiled by Swiss physician and alchemist, Lazarus Zetzner.
  
  2. Hermeticism:
  Dubuis' hermetic ideas were influenced by: 
  - The Corpus Hermeticum, foundational hermetic texts that offer profound insight into Divine secrets and human nature.
  - The Emerald Tablet, a short text outlining the principles of alchemy and hermetic philosophy.
  
  3. Qabalah:
  Critical texts and sources that helped shape Dubuis' understanding of Qabalah include:
  - The Sepher Yetzirah, a foundational text on Jewish mysticism and the earliest known work on Qabalistic thought.
  - The Zohar, central text exploring the mystical aspects of the Torah and the foundation of Kabbalistic study.
  
  Significant individuals, experiences, and events:
  
  1. Éliphas Lévi: Lévi was a prominent French occultist and influential forerunner of the modern occult revival. His works on magical, Kabbalistic teachings, and the tarot significantly impacted Dubuis' thoughts and practices.
  
  2. Fulcanelli: Dubuis was deeply inspired by Fulcanelli, an enigmatic and highly influential French alchemist.
  
  3. Founding of the Philosophers of Nature (Les Philosophes de la Nature, LPN): In 1979, Dubuis established LPN, a mystical school encompassing multiple subjects, including alchemy, hermeticism, and Qabalah.
  
  Symbiotic relationships between influences, sources, and Jean Dubuis' works:
  
  1. Fundamentals of Esoteric Knowledge: This introductory course allows students to understand the foundational concepts of Dubuis' esoteric worldview and provides the groundwork for deeper study into alchemy, hermetics, and Qabalah.
  
  2. Spagyrics: His teachings on Spagyrics (alchemical principles applied to the plant kingdom) incorporate his alchemical knowledge from Theatrum Chemicum, the Emerald Tablet, and Fulcanelli's influence.
  
  3. Qabalah: Jean Dubuis' work on the Qabalah is a synthesis of his in-depth readings on Sepher Yetzirah and Zohar, and insights from the hermetic traditions such as the Corpus Hermeticum and Lévi's writings.
  
  Jean Dubuis spent his lifetime devoted to understanding the hidden aspects of our existence through the study of alchemy, hermeticism, and Qabalah. By analyzing the origin of his teachings, significant influences in his life, and the interconnections between these diverse traditions, we gain a more profound understanding of Jean Dubuis' complex occult worldview.
