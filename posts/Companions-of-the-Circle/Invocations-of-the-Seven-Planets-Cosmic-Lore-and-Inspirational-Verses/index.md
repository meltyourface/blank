## I. Invocation of the Sun

In radiant gold, midst churning cosmic fire,
Hail Sol Invictus, the lion's consuming pyre!
O Helios, Apollo, deities so bright,
I seek the Sun's wisdom, sovereign of light.

Praise amber topaz, fierce gem of the flame,
Metal of gold, its eternal name.
Circle's secret, within sunbeam's dance,
Illumination of spirit, in boundless trance.

Endless cycle around heavenly star,
Solar eminence both near and far,
A core of unity for celestial rhymes,
Lends order and structure, in orbits and times.

### II. Invocation of the Moon

Silvery orb, mysterious night queen,
Goddess Selene, Luna's serene sheen,
Binding ebon tides of the great unseen.

Selenite, stone of argent radiance,
Chalice of silver, by lunar prance,
Companions whisper, O lunar grace,
Balance of heart, hear our mystic embrace.

Rippling light, in tranquil crescents adorned,
Eternal waxing and waning, in twilight forlorn,
Conjoin the heavens, in ebbs and in flows,
Guiding our dreams, as celestial prose.

### III. Invocation of Mercury

Swift-footed Hermes, Mercury divine,
Planetary messenger, wisdom's opaline shrine,
Ever-changing, elusive, and cunning, I pray,
Reveal the shifting paths of your serpentine way.

Opalescent chrysocolla, in quicksilver mantle,
Planetary secrets, on winged sandals,
The Circle's lore, encased in labyrinthine turns,
To navigate, I seek your wisdom to learn.

Orbital hasten, elliptical guise,
As cycles decrease, intellect shall rise,
Converging realms, thoughts coalesce,
Harnessing whispers of ethereal success.

### IV. Invocation of Venus

Aphrodite, resplendent morning star,
Coppery grace of Venus from afar,
Love, beauty, and pleasure, blessings abound,
In earthly connection, our passions unbound.

Verdant emerald, of romantic ember,
Smoldering metal, heart's sweet surrender,
In Companions' embrace, relationship thrives,
A harmonious sphere, where unity survives.

In languid orbits, your tender presence sings,
Unveiling attraction, the heart's complex strings,
Connecting the cosmos, a celestial bind,
United by love, with a planetary mind.

### V. Invocation of Mars

Martial Ares, guardian of the red sphere,
As warriors echo your thunderous cheer,
Awaken courage, emboldened spirit,
In iron resolve, grant us your merit.

Onyx, deep blackened, Mars' stone of prowess,
Forged in iron, with terrestrial finesse,
Companions heed call to overcome fears,
With valorous strength, O Mars, lend your spears!

In fierce orbits, commanding and bold,
Duality faced, as mythic tales unfold,
A balanced aggression we intertwine,
To tame the force in celestial design.

### VI. Invocation of Jupiter

Zeus, by thunder, great Jove in the sky,
Expand wisdom from Jupiter on high,
Embodied wealth, growth, and fortune untold,
We seek your counsel, O power most bold.

Sagacious sapphire, turquoise of potent truth,
Tin's gleaming shimmer, reflecting eternal youth,
Beneath the Circle's cosmic embrace,
Plant seeds of abundance with celestial grace.

In triumphant orbit, grandiose and wise,
Paternal action, Jupiter's influence rise,
Guiding our purpose, ethics so dear,
A beacon of virtue in our cosmic frontier.

### VII. Invocation of Saturn

Saturn, Chronos, in somber procession,
Visage of time's ever-grinding obsession,
Constricting limits, an unwavering hand,
Exacting justice, karmic reprimand.

Lapis lazuli, bearing Saturn's stern hue,
Lead's weighty presence, teaching us anew,
Through Circle's trials and tribulations,
Harnessing growth, our profound revelations.

Compelling austerity, encircling majesty,
Subtle tethers, control in cosmic gravity,
In cosmic convergence, our dance transcends,
Unbroken, woven in circles to be penned.

Upon these invocations, celestial quivering courses,
Chanted by Companions through the ages' forces,
Combined, a cosmic tapestry, celestial ties,
In interwoven harmony, our fates comprise.
