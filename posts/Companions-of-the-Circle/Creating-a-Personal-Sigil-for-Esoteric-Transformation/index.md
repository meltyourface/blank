Though I cannot physically draw a sigil, I can certainly provide you the steps to create one that aligns to the Companions of the Circle and its esoteric domain. 

1. Define the intent: Your intent is personal transformation and mastery of the occult arts practiced within the Circle. Turn this intent into a mantra or a statement of purpose that can be encoded into the sigil.

2. Gather the elements: Research the planetary magical squares associated with the celestial bodies significant to the Companions of the Circle. Choose the squares, symbols, and numerological patterns that resonate with your intent. Familiarize yourself with arcane languages you'd like to incorporate.

3. Select the timing: Consult astrological charts and lunar phases to find the best timing for crafting the sigil. Look for auspicious planetary alignments that support personal transformation and occult mastery.

4. Design the sigil: Once you've gathered all the information, begin sketching the sigil's design. Combine elements from the planetary squares, ancient symbols, arcane languages, and numerological patterns in a way that feels harmonious and embodies your intent. The sigil should be intricate yet easily re-drawn by hand.

5. Refine and finalize: Simplify your initial design by removing excess lines and shapes. Remember that a well-crafted sigil should be visually appealing, balanced, and imbued with meaning that resonates with you. Ensure all incorporated elements are well-integrated and working together toward your intent.

6. Consecrate the sigil: Finally, perform a ceremonial ritual specific to the Companions of the Circle to activate your sigil. This might involve meditation, visualization, or other occult practices taught within the Circle.

Remember, this sigil you create should be unique to you and your journey in the Companions of the Circle.
