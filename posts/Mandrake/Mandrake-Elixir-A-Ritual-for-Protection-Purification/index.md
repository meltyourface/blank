## Title: Elixir of Mandragoric Purification

Intention: To purge impurities, expel malevolent forces, and fortify the aura against future negativity.

Ingredients:

1. Mandrake root (fresh or dried) - 9 g
2. Blessed thistle - 6 g 
3. St. John's Wort - 6 g 
4. Angelica root - 3 g 
5. Wormwood - 3 g 
6. Mugwort - 3 g 
7. Yarrow - 3 g 
8. Salt - a pinch 
9. Spring water - 500 mL 
10. Essential oil of rosemary - 9 drops
11. Essential oil of lavender - 6 drops

Equipment:

1. Mortar and pestle
2. Cauldron
3. Wooden spoon
4. Glass or earthenware decanter
5. Filter cloth
6. Clear crystal/rune to be used as a focal point for the ritual

Preparation:

1. Begin by thoroughly cleansing and consecrating your ritual space, ensuring that it is free from any impurities or negative energies that could interfere with the potency of the elixir.

2. Using the mortar and pestle, grind the mandrake root, blessed thistle, St. John's Wort, angelica root, wormwood, mugwort, and yarrow together until they form a fine powder.

3. Light a fire beneath your cauldron and pour the spring water into it. As you do so, invoke the energies of cleansing and purification, envisioning the elixir as being imbued with these vibrations. 

4. **Slowly add the powdered mixture to the cauldron, stirring in a clockwise direction with your wooden spoon. Chant the following incantation while stirring**:

"By the power of the Mandrake root,
May impurities be expelled, and darkness take flight.
Elixir of mystic power, I call thee forth,
Banish negativity, and purify the host. 

By the wisdom of the ancient ones,
May my aura become a fortress, impenetrable by harm.
Shield me from malevolence and adversity,
Elixir of protection, grant me this boon."

5. Continue stirring and chanting until the water is fully absorbed by the herbal mixture, leaving behind a thick, paste-like consistency.

6. Place the mixture in your ritual space, adorned with the crystal or rune focal point. Allow the elixir to bask in the resonating energies of purification and protection, imbuing it with the mystical properties needed to attain its intended purpose.

7. After a suitable duration (preferably overnight), return the mixture to the cauldron and gently heat it over the flame once more, adding small amounts of water to thin it out to a liquid solution.

8. Strain the liquid through the filter cloth into the glass or earthenware decanter, leaving behind the solid remnants of the herbs.

9. Add the essential oils of rosemary and lavender to the elixir, sealing in the energetic vibrations of the entire ensemble of ingredients.

10. Close the potion with the appropriate lid, sigil, or sealing wax.

Usage:

To use the Elixir of Mandragoric Purification, anoint your pulse points (temples, wrists, and throat) daily with a small amount of the elixir. Alternatively, you may also diffuse the elixir using an oil burner to fill your space with its purifying and protective energies. For an even stronger effect, perform a grounding and centering meditation during the application of the elixir.

Store the elixir in a cool and dark place to maintain its potency.
