In shadows cast by troubled minds, a twisted path begins to wind;
Through deepest vales, to darkest skies, to realms where truths are built on lies.

The riddle holds, enigmatic, obscure, a test of will and thoughts impure;
The seeker's heart, it must unfold to glimpse the ravenous tale untold.

First a serpent, cold and sly, with venom sweet its fangs abide;
Each drop a step toward oblivion sure, an alluring pulse of a bitter cure.

A leech, that sucks the colors bright from life's unstable flickering light;
A suffocating, creeping force, quite irresistible in its course.

Now count the weightless dreams untamed, bearing endless marks of shame;
In each a secret labyrinth, where demons hunt and angels slumber.

A broken mirror on the floor, reflects the torment evermore;
Shards reveal truth's distortion in the fractured soul's contortion.

Assemble now these clues fair given, keys to a hell or a self-forged prison;
To the abyss, they form a guide, where self-destruction and fates confide.

The serpent's scales gleaming sullen, reveals the trap of earthly mirth;
Too often fall when chasing joy, to the void, and a void unfilled.

The leech represents complacency, inescapable, draining, ever hungry;
Yet can be cast away, should one choose to walk and strive each day.

The dreams, forever morphing, ever shifting, laying traps with bitter memory;
A history destined to repeat, if one dares not face winds of change.

And last, the mirror, fractured and chilling, reveals the answer in depths fulfilling;
Two visions, one clear and one twisted, empowerment or enslavement in a moment's decision.

So face the darkness, defy the tide, and forge a path with resolve inside;
Seek the strength to rebuild anew or fall to the perilous path of self-destructive doom.
