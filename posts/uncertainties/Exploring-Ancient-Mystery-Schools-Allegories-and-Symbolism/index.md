To begin the investigation of enigmatic parables embedded within arcane rites and teachings of ancient mystery schools, such as the Eleusinian Mysteries in Greece, the Mithraic cults of Rome, and the Hermetic tradition in Egypt, we must first establish the context and significance of these schools.

The Eleusinian Mysteries in Greece were initiation ceremonies held in the city of Eleusis, and they were closely associated with the worship of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, and Persephone, her daughter. The central myth of these mysteries was the story of the descent of Persephone into the underworld and her eventual return, symbolizing the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. 

Primary sources of Eleusinian Mysteries include the Homeric Hymn to Demeter and the writings of the Greek historian Pausanias. Sacred objects, such as the Kernos, a ceramic vessel used for libations, and the hierophant's throne, provide insight into the rites and rituals practiced during these ceremonies. Symbolism within this mystery school often includes seeds, wheat, and pomegranates, which represent the cycle of nature, fertility, and abundance.

The Mithraic cults of Rome were a mystery religion dedicated to the god Mithras, who was often depicted slaying a bull, symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness. The worshippers of Mithras would partake in elaborate initiation ceremonies in underground temples called Mithraea. 

Key elements of Mithraic symbolism include the tauroctony (the slaying of the bull), the seven grades of initiation, and the Zoroastrian-inspired duality of light and darkness. Primary sources for studying the Mithraic mysteries include the murals and sculptures found within Mithraea, as well as the writings of early Christian authors, such as Tertullian and Hippolytus.

The Hermetic tradition in Egypt centers around the teachings and wisdom attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure thought to be a syncretism between the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. The Hermetic texts, including the Corpus Hermeticum and the Emerald Tablet, address topics ranging from cosmology, divine truths, alchemy, and the secrets of the universe.

Within the Hermetic tradition, symbolism often revolves around the concepts of "as above, so below" â€“ the idea that the macrocosm and microcosm are intimately connected. This idea is expressed through the caduceus, the intertwined serpents, and the ouroboros.

As we delve into the complexities of the analysis, it becomes evident that these cryptic allegories significantly influenced and intertwined with esoteric disciplines such as alchemy, divination, and numerology. The Hermetic tradition directly contributed to the development of alchemy via the Emerald Tablet and its famous axiom, "As above, so below." Meanwhile, the Eleusinian Mysteries inspired concepts of cyclical transformation, and the Mithraic mysteries emphasized the duality of light and darkness.

Numerology played a significant role in Mithraic mysteries, as the seven grades of initiation symbolized the seven celestial spheres and were linked to the planets and their associated deities. Divination was connected to various mystery schools, as it was fashionable at the time to use oracles and other methods to decipher the will of the gods or foresee future events.

In conclusion, the investigation of enigmatic parables embedded within arcane rites and teachings of ancient mystery schools like the Eleusinian Mysteries, Mithraic cults, and Hermetic tradition reveals a rich tapestry of symbolism, coded language, and hidden meanings. These allegorical narratives significantly influenced and intertwined with esoteric disciplines, resulting in the formation of distinct occult philosophies that continue to captivate scholars and practitioners for centuries.
