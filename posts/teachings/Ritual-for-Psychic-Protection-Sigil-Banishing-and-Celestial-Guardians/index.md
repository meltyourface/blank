## Title: The Rite of Voiding Shadows

Purpose: To dispel malevolent psychic attacks and protect oneself from any further intrusions.

Consecrated Ritual Tools:
1. Athame (a ritual knife) - to direct personal power and energy.
2. Chalice filled with blessed water - for purification and protection.
3. Wand - to invoke elemental energies and celestial guardians.
4. Pentacle - as a symbol of the elements and a stable foundation for the ritual.
5. Censer with incense - to purify the ritual space and connect with higher energies (frankincense, myrrh, and dragon's blood are ideal choices).

Celestial Guardians: The Archangels - Raphael (East), Michael (South), Gabriel (West), and Uriel (North).

Protective Sigils:
1. Sigil of Ares - to evoke the warrior spirit and banish negativity.
2. Sigil of Saturn - for grounding and binding malevolent energies.
3. Sigil of Venus - to evoke harmony and healing after the banishing.

Auspicious Planetary Alignment: The ritual is best performed during Mars and Saturn conjunction to harness the assertive strength of Mars and the strict disciplinarian energy of Saturn.
**Step 1**: Purification
- Begin by taking a ritual bath with purifying oils or salts, such as rosemary or lavender. Meditate on cleansing your aura and visualizing all negative energy washing away.
**Step 2**: Preparation of the Ritual Space
- Choose a secluded and quiet place where you won't be disturbed.
- Cleanse the area with incense smoke and purified water.
- Cast a protective circle using your athame.
- Within the circle, place the Pentacle in the center, the Wand to the East, the Athame to the South, the Chalice to the West, and the Censer to the North.
**Step 3**: Invocation of the Elements and Celestial Guardians
- Start at the East, invoking the element of Air and Archangel Raphael.
- Continue clockwise, invoking Fire and Archangel Michael at the South, Water and Archangel Gabriel at the West, and Earth and Archangel Uriel at the North.
- Return to the East and complete the elemental circle by raising your arms overhead and acknowledging the element of Spirit.
**Step 4**: The Banishing
- Return to the center and light the chosen incense within the Censer.
- With the Athame, trace the Sigils of Ares and Saturn above the Pentacle, visualizing their power activating the protective sigil.
- Pour a small amount of blessed water into the Chalice, then sprinkle the water around the circle while reciting a banishing invocation:

  "By the powers of Fire and Air, Water, Earth, and Spirit fair,
 I banish now, all that is ill, remove all harm by my own will."
**Step 5**: Strengthening the Defense
- With your wand, trace the Sigil of Venus over the Pentacle and affirm your intention of sealing the ritual with love, harmony, and healing.
- Place an offering of food or flowers on the pentacle as a token of gratitude for celestial protection.
- Close the ritual by thanking the Archangels and the elements for their presence and assistance.
**Step 6**: Closing the Circle
- Walk counter-clockwise around the circle with the athame, closing the energetic boundary and sealing the ritual's effects.

Perform this ritual with focused intent and confidence in your abilities to nullify malevolent psychic attacks and strengthen your defenses against any future intrusions. Regular practice will improve effectiveness over time.
