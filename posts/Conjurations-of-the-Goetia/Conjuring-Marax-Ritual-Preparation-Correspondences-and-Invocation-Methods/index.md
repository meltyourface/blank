The process of conjuring Marax, the 21st spirit of Goetia, involves meticulous attention to ritual preparation, correspondence, and invocation methods. In order to analyze the process fully, we must dissect each component individually and understand how they synergistically contribute to a successful connection and communication with Marax. Additionally, acknowledging Marax's nature and rank within the Goetic hierarchy is of paramount importance, as this informs the appropriate approach to establishing the connection.

Ritual Preparation:
The conjuration of Goetic spirits requires the practitioner to be well-grounded and mentally prepared. In the case of Marax, this entails a thorough understanding of the purpose behind the conjuration. As Marax is considered to be knowledgeable in astronomy, teaching about the properties of minerals and plants and having power over raptors, it is critical to have a clear intention related to these domains when seeking to communicate with this spirit.

The practitioner must create a sacred space by either drawing a circle or constructing a consecrated environment. Tools like the Goetic Triangle should be employed to ensure a focused and secure conjuration. The circle and Triangle of Art are essential components that protect the practitioner and provide a boundary between the mundane world and the spiritual plane.

**Correspondences**:
Each Goetic spirit has unique characteristics, including corresponding symbols, astrological signs, elements, and so forth, that help attune the mage to the spirit's energy. Marax is usually associated with Venus and the element of Earth, with his sigil or seal being the primary identifying symbol. In addition, aligning the time of day or phase of the moon with Marax's preferred astrological correspondences further strengthens the connection.

During the ritual, appropriate offerings should be made to Marax, which might include incenses like sandalwood, myrrh, or frankincense, or other materials related to the spirit's domain. Staying true to these correspondences ensures an open line of communication with the spirit.

Invocation Methods:
Invocation methods vary from practitioner to practitioner, but typically involve recitation of specific prayers, names, or sonic vibrations that resonate with the desired spirit. In Marax's case, an invocation might initially involve vocalizing the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia, which serves as an opening to the spirit world, and then proceeding with recitation of the specific conjuration specific to Marax. Another method involves using Enochian keys or the use of visualizations and sigilized mantras to facilitate contact. It is crucial to adhere to the established ceremonial protocols and adapt them to one's own practice if desired.

Understanding Marax's Nature and Rank:
Marax is commonly regarded as a President and Earl with great wisdom and power. As such, approaching Marax with respect and recognition of his authority is essential when establishing a line of communication. Understanding Marax's perceived nature as a spirit that can bestow knowledge and wisdom upon the practitioner further emphasizes the need for sincere intentions and appreciation for his position within the Goetic hierarchy.

In summary, the process of conjuring Marax requires a meticulous approach to ritual preparation, thorough knowledge of correspondences, and the proper use of invocation methods. These aspects, combined with a profound understanding of Marax's nature and rank, work in harmony to facilitate a successful connection and communication with the spirit. The practitioner must maintain a respectful demeanor, stay true to the ceremonial protocols, and uphold clear purposes that align with Marax's areas of expertise. Only then can they truly immerse themselves in the profound wisdom and guidance that Marax offers.
