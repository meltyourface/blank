The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as Clavicula Salomonis Regis or Lemegeton, is a well-known grimoire on Goetic conjurations, consisting of five books. **It dates back to the 17th century, with some parts possibly tracing back to the 14th century. This text is one of the seminal sources of demonology, Goetic magic, and Solomon's wisdom on controlling and commanding spirits. The grimoire is organized into five books**: Ars Goetia, Ars Theurgia-Goetia, Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel, and Ars Notoria.

The most influential part of the Lesser Key of Solomon is without a doubt the Ars Goetia, which contains descriptions and rituals for summoning the 72 demons, each having their unique abilities and associated sigils. The methods and tools described in these conjurations have undergone significant transformations over time, adapting to sociocultural changes, individual interpretations, and the incorporation of new philosophical frameworks.

One of the notable historical evolutions of Goetic practices is the shift from the more dangerous and manipulative methods of medieval conjurations to more respectful and cooperative workings in the modern era. While traditionally magicians sought to control and enslave the invoked spirits, contemporary practitioners often prefer to negotiate and collaborate with them, considering the possibility of mutually beneficial relationships.

Another significant change that can be observed is the integration of psychological approaches within Goetic practices. Many modern magicians view the entities described in the grimoire as aspects of the human psyche, rather than autonomous beings. This perspective relies on the idea that the practitioner's subconscious mind utilizes these symbolic interactions as a means of self-discovery, growth, and empowerment.

Moreover, Goetic conjurations, which had been heavily influenced by Judeo-Christian theological frameworks, have been adopted and adapted by practitioxners from a wide range of spiritual pathways. This includes those who identify as neo-pagans, Wiccans, Thelemites, and Chaos magicians, leading to an ever-expanding set of methodologies and sources of influence within the realm of modern Goetia.

Specific examples of these changes include:

1. The emergence of Chaos Magick and its eclectic approach to practicing Goetic conjurations, promoting an innovative and highly individualistic format while encouraging the combination of various techniques, belief systems, and cultural symbols.
2. The incorporation of the Lesser Key of Solomon into the Thelemic current, with philosopher and occultist Aleister Crowley redefining the process of invoking Goetic spirits in his work "The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King."
3. The growing popularity of online occult communities, which has facilitated the exchange of ideas, experiences, adaptations, and interpretations concerning Goetic practices among practitioners from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

Despite the considerable evolution seen in the practices and methodologies of Goetic conjurations, the Lesser Key of Solomon continues to wield significant influence among contemporary occult practitioners. Its iconic imagery, rich symbolism, and time-tested system of working with spirits continue to captivate the imaginations and inspire the aspirations of many magicians, serving as a foundation for ongoing experimentation and exploration. In this way, the historical text remains vital and relevant within modern Goetic practices, even as it continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the esoteric world.
