To complete the task of analyzing the works of Abbe Boullan, we first need to establish the context of his life and the literary works that he penned. Abbe Boullan (1824-1893) was a controversial French occultist, priest, and author, who was heavily involved in the esoteric practices of French occultism and Satanism during the 19th century.

Abbe Boullan's major literary works include:
1. "La Nouvelle Vie de l'Homme-Dieu Sur Terre" (The New Life of the God-Man on Earth)
2. "Traité des Pratiques Sataniques et des Abominations des Sectes et des Sociétés Secrètes de Lucifer" (Treatise on Satanic Practices and Abominations of Sects and Secret Luciferian Societies)

Analysis of literary works:

"La Nouvelle Vie de l'Homme-Dieu Sur Terre":
In this work, Boullan conveys the idea of a new divine being who will guide humanity to a higher state of existence. The text contains esoteric and mystical symbols and references, such as the number 717, which is believed to be the numerological value of his name, which Boullan thought to be the key to the new age mentioned in the book.

"Traité des Pratiques Sataniques et des Abominations des Sectes et des Sociétés Secrètes de Lucifer":
This controversial book examines the organization and practices of Satanic sects and secret Luciferian societies, alleging that they perform blood rituals, sensual initiations, and other abominable acts. There are codes and ciphers found throughout the text, used to detail and critique the activities of occult groups at the time.

Connections with other occultists: 

During his life, Abbe Boullan was associated with other well-known figures in the French occult scene, such as Éliphas Lévi and Stanislas de Guaita. Comparing their writings and practices, similarities can be observed in the focus on theurgy, ceremonial magic, and secret teachings.

Ciphers, codes, and meanings:

Throughout the literary works of Abbe Boullan, there is extensive usage of ciphers and codes. In "Traité des Pratiques Sataniques," numerous cryptic passages are present, which can be decrypted using various cryptographic techniques such as substitution ciphers, reverse writing, and use of numbers to represent letters.

For example, 717 can be decrypted as "Abbe Boullan" when using gematria, a type of numerology used in Hebrew mysticism.

Narrative context and interpretations:

In "La Nouvelle Vie de l'Homme-Dieu Sur Terre," Boullan engages in a form of prophetic writing that invokes a sense of impending transformation. His ideas about the God-Man's return seem to align with the Gnostic concept of the divine spark hidden within humanity.

Likewise, in "Traité des Pratiques Sataniques," Boullan's exposition of the hidden societies and their rituals can be seen as a critique and a warning against the dangers of ignoring the spiritual dimension of life.

In conclusion, the writings of Abbe Boullan reveal a deep and complex understanding of occult practices, beliefs, and symbolism, along with connections to other important figures in French occultism. The decoded messages and esoteric symbols embedded within his works offer new insights into the life and motivations of this enigmatic figure, shedding light on his thoughts and philosophies and his place within the greater tapestry of 19th-century French occultism.
