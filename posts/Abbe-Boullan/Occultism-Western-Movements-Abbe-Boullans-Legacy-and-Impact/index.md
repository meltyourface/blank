To analyze and describe the potential impacts of the alleged demonic possessions, exorcisms, and controversial practices associated with Abbe Boullan's life and work on the development and trajectory of 19th-century Western occult movements, it is essential to first provide an overview of Abbe Boullan and his associations within the context of occultism. 

Jean-Baptiste Boullan was a French Catholic priest, born in 1824, who became a controversial figure in the occult world due to his involvement in various spiritual and esoteric practices. He was an influential member of the HÃ©bertist movement, which sought to blend traditional Catholicism with occult beliefs and practices. One of the critical aspects of his work was his participation in exorcisms and alleged demonic possessions, leading to opposition and controversies throughout his life.

Now, let's examine the potential impacts of these allegations and practices on the development and trajectory of 19th-century Western occult movements while considering the cultural and historical circumstances that influenced both the supporters and adversaries of Boullan during this time period.

Impact on the Occult Movements:
1. Revival and Expansion of Occult Practices: The notoriety and controversy surrounding Boullan's practices played a role in the resurgence of interest in occult practices in 19th-century Europe. His rituals, including exorcisms and invocations, brought attention to the role of spiritual forces within the human experience. This interest led to numerous esoteric societies and organizations, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO).

2. Shift in Catholic Church Attitudes: In response to Boullan's subversive practices and ideas, the Catholic Church sought to address the rise of occult practices and the growing interest in spirituality outside the bounds of traditional Christian orthodoxy. This shift contributed to the church's condemnation of spiritualism and the occult, reinforcing the 'forbidden' nature of these studies and practices, which in turn heightened their allure for certain segments of the population.

3. Boullan as a Symbolic Figure: Boullan became a symbol of the intersection of traditional Catholicism and occult practice. His legend acted as a catalyst for discussion on the role of spiritual and esoteric practices within religious and secular contexts. As a result, he became a figure of both admiration and derision, depending on one's position on the broader spectrum of beliefs.

Cultural and Historical Circumstances:
1. Industrialization and Discontents: The 19th century was a time of rapid industrialization and social change in Western Europe. This period saw urbanization and a decline in traditional rural life, leading to spiritual and existential crises for many. Boullan's teachings offered an alternative to the new mechanistic worldview, providing an opportunity for spiritual exploration and guidance.

2. The Rise of Spiritualism: The 19th century also saw the rise of Spiritualism, a movement focused on the belief in communication with the dead and the existence of spiritual forces at play in daily life. Boullan's alleged exorcisms and engagements with the demonic resonated with these ideas, leading some followers to view him as a conduit to hidden knowledge and spiritual enlightenment.

3. The Political Climate: The political upheavals of the time, including revolutions and social unrest, contributed to a sense of uncertainty and the desire for alternative sources of stability. Abbe Boullan's teachings represented a potential avenue to gain power and spiritual stability, which attracted both supporters and adversaries.

In summary, the alleged demonic possessions, exorcisms, and controversial practices associated with Abbe Boullan significantly impacted the development and trajectory of 19th-century Western occult movements. His notoriety and the controversies surrounding him contributed to the revival and expansion of occult practices, a shift in the Catholic Church's attitude towards spiritualism, and the construction of Boullan as a symbolic figure representing the intersection of traditional Catholicism and occult practice. These impacts were shaped by the cultural and historical circumstances of the era, including industrialization, the rise of Spiritualism, and the political climate. As such, the life and work of Abbe Boullan serve as an essential case study in understanding the complex evolution of occult movements during the 19th century.
