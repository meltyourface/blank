- Initiation into a Martinist Order, fascination with Joan of Arc as a spiritual guide, and his defrocking from priesthood due to unorthodox practices

Abbe Boullan was initially a priest before he became deeply involved in the occult. His life and contributions can largely be summarized by his initiation into a Martinist Order, his fascination with Joan of Arc as a spiritual guide, and ultimately his defrocking from priesthood due to unorthodox practices.

Abbe Boullan, born in 1824 in France, was a controversial figure in the world of esoteric and occult practices. The Martinist Order, created by Martinez de Pasqually and further developed by Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, is an organization that deals with the study and continuation of Christian mysticism and esoteric spirituality. Boullan was initiated into this order, which played a significant role in shaping his beliefs and practices.

One of the most notable aspects of Boullan's occult work was his fascination with Joan of Arc, the famous French heroine and martyr who he claimed to be in contact with as a spiritual guide. He believed that she was guiding him in his mission to reform the Catholic Church. This connection with Joan of Arc was instrumental in the development of Boullan's beliefs and practices, as he aimed to continue her mission in a mystical manner.

However, Boullan's unorthodox practices, along with his involvement in the occult, eventually led to his defrocking from the priesthood. This was a significant turning point in his life, as it allowed him to delve further into esoteric studies without the constraints of his religious position. This led him to create the controversial Order of the New Alliance, which aimed to reconcile the Catholic Church with mysticism and occult knowledge.

In conclusion, Abbe Boullan's life was characterized by his initiation into a Martinist Order, his fascination with Joan of Arc as a spiritual guide, and his defrocking from the priesthood due to unorthodox practices that have shaped his occult contributions. It's important to understand the context of his experiences and influences, as they played a significant role in the development of his esoteric beliefs and practices.
