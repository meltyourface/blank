Abbe Boullan, born in France in 1824, initially entered the Roman Catholic priesthood. However, his controversial beliefs and practices led to his excommunication from the Catholic Church. Boullan was influenced by occultist Eugène Vintras, who claimed to be a prophet and a reincarnation of the prophet Elijah. Vintras, claiming to have received divine revelations, founded a new religious movement centered around his visions and mystical experiences. Abbe Boullan and Vintras established a close alliance, with Boullan absorbing many of Vintras' teachings and incorporating them into his own beliefs.

Boullan later founded his own religious movement called the Johannite Church, which combined elements of Catholicism, occultism, and the beliefs he had learned from Vintras. This new church emphasized Gnostic teachings, focused on a supposed "divine feminine" principle, and held the belief in the imminent arrival of a new messiah.

Due to Boullan's controversial ideas and allegations of immoral practices within the group, he faced a trial and was ultimately imprisoned. The rumored practices included debauchery, animal sacrifice, and the supposed use of occult practices for malicious purposes.

In conclusion, Abbe Boullan's life trajectory encompassed several critical moments and influences. His birth in France, priesthood, and excommunication from the Catholic Church, his alliance with occultist Eugène Vintras, founding the Johannite Church, and his trial and imprisonment for immoral practices accurately represent key aspects of his life and spiritual beliefs.
