To respond effectively to the challenge, we will begin by outlining Abbe Boullan's life experiences, beliefs, and influences in the first section, extracting arguments that contribute to his development of the Johannite Church of Primitive Christians. In the second part of the response, we will discuss the contributions of this endeavor to his controversial positioning within the broader occult and religious communities of the 19th century.

Abbe Boullan's Life Experiences, Beliefs, and Influences:

1. Life experiences: Abbe Boullan, born as Jean-Baptiste Boullan in 1824, was raised in a religious household. He was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1850. Boullan suffered from episodes of mental illness throughout his life and faced troubling events, including being imprisoned and being declared insane in later years. His experiences within institutional religion gave him firsthand exposure to various religious practices and rituals, contributing to the foundation of his esoteric ideas.

2. Esoteric beliefs: Boullan was deeply involved in the exploration of concepts like spiritualism, divine revelation, and mysticism. He believed in the hierarchical structure of heaven, hell, and purgatory, with angels and demons influencing people's lives. These ideas significantly shaped his development of the Johannite Church of Primitive Christians as he integrated these concepts into his interpretations of Christian texts.

3. Influence from the Roman Catholic Church: As a former Catholic priest, Boullan was steeped in the tradition and theology of the Church. He broke away from the Churchâ€™s stricter teachings, though, which likely fueled his desire to form an independent religious order that accommodated alternative beliefs and esoteric practices.

4. Eliphas Levi's work: Eliphas Levi was a prominent French occultist and author of several influential books during the 19th century. His work on the Tarot symbolism, Kabbalah, and esoteric tradition influenced Abbe Boullan. By drawing on Levi's ideas and incorporating them into his doctrines, Boullan further clashed with the traditional religious establishment and added depth to his esoteric teachings within the Johannite Church of Primitive Christians.

Development of the Johannite Church of Primitive Christians:

With the contexts of his life experiences, beliefs, and influences in mind, we can now examine how they contributed to the development of the Johannite Church of Primitive Christians.

1. Restoration of primitive Christianity: Boullan believed that the Catholic Church had deviated from the original teachings of Christ. He sought to restore a more primitive spirituality based on direct revelation, mystical experiences, and the esoteric interpretation of scripture. Thus, the Johannite Church of Primitive Christians combined elements of Catholicism with spiritualism and occult wisdom.

2. Emphasizing the role of Saint John the Baptist: Boullan regarded John the Baptist as the true initiator of Christ, representing the occult teachings of the inner circle. The Johannite Church upheld the spiritual authority of John the Baptist, contrasting with the Catholic Church's focus on Saint Peter.

3. Balance between good and evil: Drawing on esoteric traditions and his personal beliefs, Boullan promoted a dynamic equilibrium between good and evil forces. This contrasted with the traditional dualistic teachings of the Catholic Church, where evil was meant to be eradicated. The Johannite Church saw the struggle between light and darkness as a necessary part of the spiritual journey, embracing an occult worldview.

Controversial Positioning within the Occult and Religious Communities:

Abbe Boullan's Johannite Church of Primitive Christians had significant implications for his positioning within the broader occult and religious communities of the 19th century, which contributed to his controversial status.

1. Conflict with established religious institutions: Boullan's departure from traditional Catholic teachings, his formation of an independent church, and his esoteric interpretations of Christianity antagonized the Catholic Church, leading to his excommunication and a rift between mainstream religious institutions and himself.

2. Occult connections: Boullan's relationship with prominent esoteric figures, like Eliphas Levi, and his incorporation of occult wisdom into his teachings attracted an enthusiastic following among occultists and mystics, but also fueled accusations of heresy and demonic involvements which further isolated him from mainstream society.

3. Scandalous practices: The Johannite Church's ritual practices, which included sexual rites and invoking the aid of spiritual entities, were considered controversial and provoked criticism from both religious and occult communities. These practices contributed to Boullan's vilification and marginalization within both communities.

In conclusion, Abbe Boullan's life experiences, esoteric beliefs, and influences from the Roman Catholic Church and Eliphas Levi shaped the development of the Johannite Church of Primitive Christians with its focus on restoring primitive spirituality, the role of John the Baptist, and esoteric believes. This church and its connections to occultism further contributed to Boullan's controversial positioning within the broader occult and religious communities of the 19th century.
