The connection between Abbe Boullan's controversial doctrines and the development of occultism during the 19th century has to be understood within the broader context of European intellectual and social history, as well as with reference to specific movements in the burgeoning field of esotericism. In order to explain this connection and highlight how his actions and affiliations contributed to his reputation as both a visionary and dangerous figure in the esoteric landscape, it will be necessary to summarize Boullan's biography and doctrine, to link them with wider currents of thought, and to analyze the controversies surrounding his activities and associations. 

Abbe Joseph-Antoine Boullan (1824-1893) was a French Roman Catholic priest who was defrocked for heresy in 1860 and who ultimately became a prominent figure in the occult movement that flourished during the 19th century. Boullan's doctrines were heavily influenced by his experiences with a series of mystical visions and alleged supernatural encounters. In particular, Boullan came to believe in the existence of a complex angelic hierarchy, which he sought to access and employ through a combination of ascetic practices, liturgical innovations, and unorthodox sexual rituals.

At the core of Boullan's doctrine was the notion of "union with the angelic," which involved a metaphysical fusion of the believer's soul with the divine essence of the angelic realm. He postulated that sexual intercourse, when conducted in a ritual context and guided by the right intentions, could become a powerful means of attaining this union. This idea was, by its nature, highly controversial, as it challenged both the conventional religious doctrines of his time as well as society's deeply entrenched moral codes. 

To understand the connection between Boullan's doctrines and the development of occultism during the 19th century, it is essential to recognize the context of widespread spiritual and intellectual ferment that characterized this period. The Enlightenment had profoundly destabilized the authority of religious institutions and had given rise to a host of eclectic, heterodox, and esoteric spiritual movements. Figures such as Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Éliphas Lévi, and Paschal Beverly Randolph were articulating new syncretic beliefs that drew on sources as diverse as Eastern religion, alchemy, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Christian mysticism.

Boullan's doctrines can be seen as a part of this broader occult resurgence. His emphasis on the central role of sex in spiritual development resonated with other currents of thought in the 19th-century occult milieu - notably with Paschal Beverly Randolph's theory of "sexual magic" and with some traditions of Tantra in Hinduism and Buddhism. Furthermore, Boullan's focus on the direct, experiential connection with the divine echoed the broader Romantic impulse to embrace individualism and subjectivity in matters of faith and spirituality.

The perception of Boullan as both a visionary and dangerous figure within the esoteric landscape of the time stemmed from his controversial doctrines as well as from his actions and affiliations with different organizations. The most prominent of these associations was his collaboration with the French occultist and writer Jules Doinel, who was the founder of the neo-Gnostic "Church of Carmel" (L'Église du Carmel). This church aimed to revive the mystical gnosis of early Christianity and fuse it with elements of Catharism, Kabbalah, and other esoteric traditions. Boullan's association with Doinel and the Church of Carmel represented a synthesis of his own ideas with those of a wider occult network.

However, Boullan's doctrine and practices attracted significant opposition and condemnation, both from religious authorities and from other figures within the occult milieu. Most infamously, the Marquis Stanislas de Guaita, a fellow occultist and rival of Boullan, accused him of leading a coven of diabolical sorcerers. As a result of such accusations and controversies, Boullan's work became associated with subversion, deviance, and dangerous forms of esoteric knowledge.

In summary, the connection between Abbe Boullan's controversial doctrines and the development of occultism during the 19th century can be traced to the broader climate of intellectual and spiritual experimentation that had emerged in the wake of the Enlightenment. Boullan's doctrine of sexual mysticism resonated with other contemporary occult thought and resonated with the individualistic ethos of the Romantic age. His actions and affiliations - such as his work with Doinel and the Church of Carmel - further embedded him within the esoteric landscape of the time. However, his transgressive ideas and practices also provoked accusations of blasphemy and sorcery, casting him as both a visionary and dangerous figure in the annals of 19th-century occultism.
