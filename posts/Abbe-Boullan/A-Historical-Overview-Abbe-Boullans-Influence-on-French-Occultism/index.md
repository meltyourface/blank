In order to fully comprehend the interconnection between the spiritual beliefs and mystical practices of Abbe Boullan, along with his influence on French occultism and esotericism, it is essential to delve into his background and the doctrines he formulated. Furthermore, exploring the prominent figures who opposed his doctrines will provide a broader perspective on the intricacies of this period in the history of occultism.

Abbe Boullan (1824-1893) was a French Roman Catholic priest who embraced esotericism and founded the Society of the New Alliance, also known as the Johannite Church of the Carmel. His teachings, mystical practices, and association with the controversial figure of Catherine "La Voisin" Deshayes heavily influenced the development of French occultism during the mid-19th century.

Boullan's spiritual beliefs were rooted in his version of Gnostic Christianity. He revered John the Baptist as the true Christ and believed in divine emanations and the role of intermediary spiritual beings. Boullan considered himself as the reincarnation of John the Baptist and saw his mission as liberating humanity from the corrupt, materialistic world through a mix of religious and occult practices.

One of the central elements of Boullan's mystical practices was sexual magic, which aimed to tap into transformative spiritual energies. This involved complex rituals and ceremonies, with practitioners believing that it would lead to higher spiritual states and a deep understanding of the divine. Boullan's incorporation of sexual magic and esoteric practices into Christian doctrines was considered revolutionary and dangerous by the Catholic Church and conservative figures.

Abbe Boullan's influence on the French occultism and esotericism is indisputable as he was close to significant esoteric figures of the time, such as Éliphas Lévi, a renowned occultist. Boullan's teachings inspired many subsequent French esotericists, including Stanislas de Guaita, a prominent occultist and co-founder of the Cabalistic Order of the Rosicrucian. His mystical practices and belief in the divination, magic, and the Qabalah were resonating with the broader esoteric movement that was gaining momentum in Europe.

However, many prominent figures opposed Abbe Boullan's doctrines due to their controversial nature and unorthodox methods. One such individual was Joris-Karl Huysmans, a French writer who initially admired Boullan's teachings but later distanced himself. Huysmans eventually wrote the novel "Là-bas," a fictional portrayal of a corrupt priest that was partially inspired by Boullan. The Catholic Church also vehemently opposed Boullan's doctrines, considering them heretical and morally deviant.

In conclusion, the interconnection between Abbe Boullan's spiritual beliefs and mystical practices is evident in his devotion to the esoteric aspects of Gnostic Christianity, coupled with rituals like sexual magic. His influence on French occultism and esotericism is tangible as seen through his association with key figures and the impression he left on subsequent esoteric orders. However, the opposition from both the conservative factions like the Catholic Church and former admirers such as Huysmans significantly contributed to the controversy surrounding his doctrines. Overall, the story of Abbe Boullan showcases the inherent complexities between mysticism, religion, and societal values during that time in history.
