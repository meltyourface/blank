To answer this knowledge challenge, let's first start by introducing Abbe Boullan and then diving into the details of his personal experiences, beliefs, occult practices, and philosophy. We will then analyze his role and relationships in the context of the evolution of esotericism during the late 19th century. 

Abbe Boullan (1824-1893) was a French Roman Catholic priest, occultist, and a prominent figure in esoteric circles during the late 19th century. He was born with the name Jean-Baptiste Jules Boullan, and he became fascinated by esotericism, the occult, and mysticism at an early age. His involvement in these matters would eventually lead to his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church, his founding of the 'Work of Mercy,' and his eventual association with Stanislas de Guaita, a fellow occultist and founder of the Cabalistic Order of the Rosy Cross.

Key Event 1: Personal Experiences and Beliefs
Boullan's personal experiences played a significant role in shaping his beliefs and practices in the esoteric and occult world. For instance, he became fascinated by the works of mystics such as Emanuel Swedenborg and the experiences of the stigmatic Catherine Emmerich. These figures influenced his ideas of spiritualism and the connections between the spiritual and temporal worlds, opening him up to the possibilities of receiving divine guidance and power through mystical means.

Key Event 2: Founding of the 'Work of Mercy'
The 'Work of Mercy' was an organization founded by Boullan in 1860 after his disillusionment with the traditional Roman Catholic Church. This organization was formed with the intention of promoting healing and spiritual assistance through a combination of Boullan's religious and mystical knowledge. This brotherhood included both Church members and practitioners of the occult, making it a unique and controversial group. In an act of defiance against the Church, Boullan called upon esoteric and mystical teachings to shape his organization's practices, further highlighting the intertwining of his personal experiences and the occult.

Key Event 3: Expulsion from the Roman Catholic Church
Abbe Boullan's unorthodox beliefs and practices led to his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church. They considered his work and ideas heretical and dangerous. This event only fueled Boullan's passion for mysticism and the occult, as it freed him to explore and develop his own theories and practices without the constraints of the Church.

Key Event 4: Connection with Stanislas de Guaita
The association between Abbe Boullan and Stanislas de Guaita is another crucial aspect to understand theimpact of Boullan on the esoteric movement of the late 19th century. Guaita, a French poet and occultist, was the founder of the Cabalistic Order of the Rosy Cross. He was drawn to Boullan and his ideas and sought to learn from him and incorporate Boullan's teachings into his order's practices. This alliance further solidified Boullan's influence and the integration of his personal experiences and beliefs in the broader esoteric community during that time.

To summarize, Abbe Boullan played a crucial role in shaping the esoteric landscape of the late 19th century. The intertwining of his mystical beliefs, passion for occultism, and personal experiences greatly influenced key events such as the founding of the 'Work of Mercy,' his expulsion from the Roman Catholic Church, and his alliance with Stanislas de Guaita. Boullan's life and work exemplify the trend of embracing mysticism and the occult as a response to the religious and scientific shifts of the time. It is through figures like Boullan that the evolving landscape of esotericism in the late 19th century can be better understood and appreciated.
