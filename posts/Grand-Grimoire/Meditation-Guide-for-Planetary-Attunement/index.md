### II. Planetary Energies and Correspondences
Before embarking on this journey of attunement, it is crucial to understand the correspondences between the celestial bodies, their corresponding spirits, and the energetic vibrations they emanate. The following are the key correspondences:

1. Sun - Spirit: Och
   Energy: Vitality, power, success

2. Moon - Spirit: Phul
   Energy: Intuition, emotions, dreams

3. Mars - Spirit: Phaleg
   Energy: Strength, courage, aggression

4. Mercury - Spirit: Ophiel
   Energy: Communication, intellect, travel

5. Jupiter - Spirit: Bethor
   Energy: Expansion, growth, prosperity

6. Venus - Spirit: Hagith
   Energy: Love, beauty, harmony

7. Saturn - Spirit: Aratron
   Energy: Structure, discipline, restriction

### III. Meditative Practices
The following steps outline the meditative practices for each celestial body, incorporating their respective symbols, sigils, and incantations:

1. Preparation:
   - Find a quiet, private space where you can focus on your meditation.
   - Cleanse yourself and the space using sage, incense, or any preferred cleansing method.
   - Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and take deep breaths to calm your mind.

2. Planetary Attunement:
   - Begin with the celestial body you wish to attune to, visualizing its symbol and energy in your mind's eye.
   - Chant the corresponding incantation as you meditate around that energy:
   
   For example, to attune with the Sun:
   - Visualize the symbol of the sun
   - Chant: "Lux solis, potestas magnus, Och adjuva me."
    
   Repeat this process for each celestial body you wish to connect with during your session.

3. Visualization and Sigil Work:
   - As you chant and visualize the celestial body, focus on drawing its sigil in front of you with the energy it emanates.
   - Slowly visualize the sigil glowing with the corresponding energy and absorbing that energy into your body.
   - Feel the increased potency of the planetary energy within you, empowering your hidden arts practice.

4. Closing and Grounding:
   - Once finished with the meditation, visualize the sigils and symbols fading away as the energy is sealed within you.
   - Take a few deep breaths and ground yourself by focusing on your physical body and surroundings.
   - Thank the spirits of the celestial bodies for their assistance and close your session.

### IV. Integration and Daily Practice
To fully harness the power of these meditative practices, it is essential to integrate them into your daily routine. The following steps will guide you in the integration process:

1. Set aside a specific time each day for your meditation practice, accounting for the amount of time necessary to complete your chosen attunements.
2. Keep a journal detailing your experiences, insights, and progress during your meditative sessions.
3. Modify the focus on specific celestial bodies based on your personal goals, working on areas that require more attention.

By consistently engaging with these meditative practices and incorporating them into your daily routine, you will attune to the planetary energies of the arcane cosmology and strengthen your mastery of the hidden arts.
