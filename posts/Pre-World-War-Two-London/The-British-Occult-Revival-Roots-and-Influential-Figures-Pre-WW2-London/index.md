Answer:

The British Occult Revival in Pre-World War Two London was a complex cultural phenomenon characterized by the resurgence of interest in esoteric, mystical, and spiritual ideas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. **Several specific underlying factors and events contributed to this phenomenon, including**:

1. **Industrial Revolution and Social Dislocation**: The Industrial Revolution led to rapid urbanization, bringing people from rural areas into cities, creating social unrest, and breaking traditional social bonds. This dislocation engendered a sense of spiritual malaise and a yearning for deeper meanings and connections, leading many people to explore alternative belief systems like the occult.

2. **Decline of Traditional Religion**: The intellectual and spiritual authority of Christianity was being eroded by scientific advances, the historical criticism of the Bible, and the rise of other forms of secular humanism. As people searched for new sources of spiritual meaning and identity outside the established church, the occult and esoteric traditions offered appealing alternatives.

3. **Influence of Eastern Mysticism**: The colonial expansion of the British Empire brought increased exposure to Eastern religions, philosophies, and spiritual practices, which offered novel perspectives on human existence, the natural world, and the divine. The fascination with Eastern mysticism fueled the Western esoteric movement.

4. **Intellectual and Artistic Trends**: The fin de siècle (end of century) cultural climate was marked by a fascination with the occult, symbolism, and mysticism. Romanticism, Decadence, and Symbolism in literature and the arts embraced the exotic, irrational, and mystical, providing fertile ground for the growth of esoteric ideas and practices.

5. **The Theosophical Movement**: Founded in 1875 by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, the Theosophical Society aimed to study the ancient wisdom of the East and to form a universal brotherhood of humanity. The movement popularized occult and metaphysical ideas, providing a platform for the exchange and dissemination of esoteric knowledge, attracting many key figures in the British Occult Revival.

These factors interconnect with prominent figures and their esoteric teachings in the broader sociopolitical environment of Pre-World War Two London. **Some key personalities include**:

1. **Aleister Crowley**: A notorious occultist, writer, and spiritual leader, Crowley was instrumental in the founding of the religion of Thelema, the A∴A∴ (Astrum Argenteum) order, and the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). His ideas were both highly influential and controversial, promoting individualism and challenging religious norms of the time.

2. **Dion Fortune**: A prominent occultist, writer, and co-founder of the Fraternity of the Inner Light, Fortune helped develop the modern Western esoteric tradition through her writings and teachings. She emphasized the integration of psychological and mystical practice, and her work was foundational to modern magical and theosophical movements.

3. **Arthur Edward Waite**: A prominent occult scholar and writer, Waite was responsible for creating the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot deck (along with artist Pamela Colman Smith), which became one of the most popular and enduring tarot decks in the history of the divinatory practice. As a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Waite introduced esoteric teachings to a broader audience.

4. **Florence Farr**: An influential actress, playwright, and esoteric theorist, Farr was a key member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which greatly influenced the British Occult Revival. She contributed to the development of esoteric practices and rituals, and her collaborations with prominent artists and writers helped popularize occult ideas.

In summary, the British Occult Revival in Pre-World War Two London was fueled by an intricate interplay of sociopolitical and intellectual factors, which ranged from the spiritual malaise generated by the Industrial Revolution to the decline of traditional religious authority, alongside increased exposure to Eastern mysticism and a fascination with the mysterious and unexplored. These factors interconnect with the lives and teachings of key esoteric figures such as Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, Arthur Edward Waite, and Florence Farr, who actively shaped, promoted, and disseminated occult ideas and practices in the broader sociopolitical environment of the period.
