The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) were two of the most influential esoteric orders in pre-World War Two London. Despite some similarities, such as both drawing from the rich hermetic traditions and knowledge of the occult, they have several key differences in their rites, observances, doctrines, and methodologies. I will elaborate on their contrasting approaches to magic, initiation, and hierarchy, as well as the influence of the cultural, political, and social milieu of the time on their doctrines.

1. **Magic**:
The Golden Dawn primarily focused on ceremonial magic aimed at individual spiritual development and growth. Adepts of the order were taught techniques of self-discovery, mastery of the elements, invocation of angels, astral projection, and divination (using Tarot, Astrology, and other methods). Magic practiced in the Golden Dawn was meant to be used for self-enlightenment and to foster a higher understanding of the divine.

In contrast, Crowley's O.T.O. ****emphasized the importance of Thelema, a philosophical, mystical, and religious system that revolves around the Law of Thelema****: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." Crowley's magical practices encompassed a wider range of activities, including the use of sex magic as a means of spiritual transformation. This focus on sexuality, as seen in certain rituals and practices, set the O.T.O. apart from other contemporary organizations such as the Golden Dawn.

2. **Initiation**:
The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn had a well-structured initiation system, consisting of three orders (Outer, Second, and Third), and ten grades within the Outer Order. Each grade had corresponding rituals, symbols, and knowledge that needed to be learned and mastered before progressing to the next level. This approach emphasized a systematic and gradual development of the initiate, designed to facilitate personal growth and spiritual advancement.

In contrast, the Ordo Templi Orientis had its own hierarchy, inspired by the Freemasonic degrees and Crowley's own additions. The O.T.O. initiation system revolved around eleven degrees, with a focus on progressive knowledge acquisition and Crowley's Thelemic principles. The initiation rites placed greater emphasis on Thelema and Crowley's ideals, rather than the specific rituals and symbols of the Golden Dawn.

3. **Hierarchy**:
Both the Golden Dawn and the O.T.O. had a hierarchical structure, with the Golden Dawn's hierarchy being more complex, consisting of the three aforementioned orders and the ten grades within the Outer Order. The Chiefs of the Golden Dawn, who managed the order and its teachings, held important roles and were highly respected by members.

The O.T.O., on the other hand, had a simpler hierarchy based on the eleven degrees. Crowley held the highest position within the order and maintained considerable control over the direction of the O.T.O. He was considered the Outer Head of the Order (O.H.O.) and the chief authority on all matters related to the organization.

4. **Influence of the cultural, political, and social milieu**:
The emergence of both the Golden Dawn and O.T.O. was driven by a resurgence of interest in spirituality, mysticism, and occultism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Additionally, both orders were influenced by the works of prominent figures in the field, such as Eliphas Levi, S. L. MacGregor Mathers, Dr. William Wynn Westcott, and the vast Magical Papyrus collection that was being decoded and translated at the time.

However, there were differences in how each order responded to the social, cultural, and political context. The Golden Dawn represented a synthesis of various mystical and esoteric streams with a focus on personal development and in-depth study of traditional wisdom and ancient knowledge. On the other hand, Crowley's O.T.O. took a more radical approach, incorporating the increasingly controversial concept of sex magic and positioning itself as an alternative to the conventional religious, social, and political organizations of the time.

In conclusion, while both the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis were rooted in esoteric traditions, their approaches to magic, initiation, and hierarchy differed in key aspects. The cultural, political, and social milieu of pre-World War Two London influenced the direction and development of both organizations, setting the stage for the evolution of the Western esoteric tradition in the years to come.
