## The Occult Terrain of Pre-World War Two London

Introduction

Pre-World War Two London was a bustling hub of occult activity and esoteric exploration. At the turn of the 20th century, secret societies such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn flourished, and prominent figures like Aleister Crowley engaged in the study and practice of ritual magic. In this section, we will delve deep into the rich and mysterious world of the occult in London, painting a vivid picture of the key players, practices, rituals, and locations that shaped the landscape of esoteric tradition before the outbreak of World War Two.

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn

At the heart of London's occult scene was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a secret society founded in the late 19th century by eminent Freemasons William Wynn Westcott, Samuel Liddell Mathers, and William Robert Woodman. Drawing from a wide range of esoteric sources, including Christian mysticism, kabbalah, tarot, astrology, and alchemy, the Golden Dawn offered a structured system of magical initiation and training.

Members of the Golden Dawn participated in spiritual development through a series of graded rituals, designed to guide novices from the outer circles of the society (the Neophyte grade) to the upper echelons of mystical knowledge (the Adeptus Minor and Adeptus Major). Adepts of the Golden Dawn studied and practiced a wide range of magical disciplines, such as astral travel, scrying, invocation, and talismanic magic.

Under the tutelage of the Golden Dawn, prominent occultists like Aleister Crowley, Israel Regardie, A.E. Waite, and Dion Fortune honed their craft, launching themselves into influential careers and leaving lasting legacies on the world of esoteric studies.

Key Figures

1. Aleister Crowley (1875-1947)
One of the most infamous figures within the world of the occult, Aleister Crowley was introduced to the Golden Dawn in 1898. While his colourful antics led to his expulsion from the order, Crowley developed his own system of magic known as Thelema, which incorporated the Golden Dawn's teachings alongside Egyptian mythology, yoga, and sexual magic.

2. Israel Regardie (1907-1985)
A student of Crowley, Israel Regardie was responsible for documenting the teachings and rituals of the Golden Dawn, ensuring their continued availability for students of the occult. His publications, including The Golden Dawn and The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic, became essential reference materials for those seeking to learn the craft.

3. Dion Fortune (1890-1946)
Dion Fortune was initiated into the Alpha et Omega temple of the Golden Dawn and focused on "practical magic," which sought tangible results from magical workings. She authored several books on occult subjects, such as The Mystical Qabalah and Psychic Self-Defense, which provided instruction on the kabbalistic Tree of Life and psychic energy protection, respectively.

Magical Practices and Rituals

1. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)
The LBRP is a foundational ritual employed by adepts of the Golden Dawn to purify themselves and their sacred space before engaging in any magical work. It involves the invocation of the Elemental forces, represented by the four pentagram points, and the Archangels, who stand guard over the magic practitioner.

2. The Middle Pillar Exercise
This is an energy work and visualization exercise in which practitioners envision a divine pillar of light descending from the crown of their head, passing through various energy centers of their body, and grounding into the earth. The Middle Pillar Exercise was intended to balance and activate the participant's energies to facilitate spiritual growth and magical efficacy.

Occult-Significant Locations

1. The British Museum Reading Room
Frequented by aspiring occultists, The British Museum Reading Room housed a vast collection of books, manuscripts, and ancient artifacts that provided insightful knowledge into esoteric practices and lore.

2. The Atlantis Bookshop
Founded in 1921, The Atlantis Bookshop served as a meeting place for London's esoteric community. Owned by occultist Michael Houghton, the bookshop stocked a wide array of esoteric literature, making it an essential hub for students seeking to deepen their understanding of the occult.
