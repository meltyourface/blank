## I. The Fool

Beneath the Moon's pale glimmer in old Whitechapel
Stood a naïve wanderer, fearless in his tracks
Within the smoky alleyways he dared to dabble
All eyes upon the cradled mystery in his sack

Upon the brink of dawn, the charlatan Crowley
Tempted with a knowing smile of eldritch delight
But heedless of the portents, and impending folly
The Fool strode on his path, into the starless night

### II. The High Priestess

In a hallowed lair, 'neath the visage of Cleopatra's Needle
Candles flicker as the High Priestess held her stand
Tendrils of smoke curl 'round her whispered riddles
Sharing ancient secrets, in this clandestine land

Her pensive gaze beheld the bomb-shadows looming
Over each sermon she held the fearing throng
Encrypted runes crystal clear, their dark consuming
Yet still the Priestess trusted in the Rosicrucian song

### III. The Magician

Aloof within the British Museum's eerie vaults he lingers
By night's embrace, he dared the world unseen
The Magician held the wand 'twixt firm unwavering fingers
Arcane rituals commenced among the shrines and beams

As demons of the Angel station flit in shadows
His circle cast, with wand and sword, the truth had sway
For London's vaults concealed a power that bellowed
And in the Magician's art, all would be swayed

### IV. The Hanged Man

From the Tower of London's ancient stones, a figure spliced
The Hanged Man hung in corners, twisting 'round his fate
Desperation lingered in this eerie sacrifice
As the hum of distant engines belied the wartime weight

Midst the crimson glow of Besant’s Theosophic notions
He pondered realms beyond, elusive, firmament bound
Yet sacrifice must bear the sting of bitter potions
So the Hanged Man swayed, immobile but unbound

### V. Death

The fog of war embraced old Covent Garden's market
A spectral figure danced beneath the gaslights' graze
Grim and somber, with hands outstretched to beckon
The reaper solemn, swung the scythe to mete the days

Famine and despair haunted London's cobbled streets
Ravens lurked on spires, their wings outstretched like augurs
In each dark dwelling, lay the fear of bitter defeat
And on the brink of chaos, Death foretold the horror
