To fully comprehend and respond to this knowledge challenge, let us first divide it into three main parts:

1. Understanding Paracelsus' concept of the Tria Principia (Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt).
2. Comparison and contrasting of Paracelsus' Tria Principia with traditional alchemical depictions.
3. Exploring parallel applications of the Tria Principia in human physiology, spiritual evolution, and the natural world.

Understanding Paracelsus' concept of the Tria Principia:

Paracelsus (1493-1541) was a Swiss physician and alchemist who revolutionized medicine and the understanding of alchemy in his time. His concept of the Tria Principia, or the Three Principles, refers to Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt as the foundational elements of all matter in the universe. 

According to Paracelsus, 
- Mercury represented the spirit, or the volatile aspect of matter, the force that allows movement, transformation, and fluidity.
- Sulfur was associated with the soul and the combustible aspect of matter, housing the vital essence and inherent characteristics or qualities.
- Salt was a symbol of the body, the solid aspect of matter, providing form, structure, and stability. 

These three principles were believed to form a triune nature present in all things, including living beings and the macrocosm of the universe.

Comparison and contrasting of Paracelsus' Tria Principia with traditional alchemical depictions:

Before Paracelsus, alchemy was deeply intertwined with mysticism, with few practical applications. Traditional alchemical depictions focused primarily on the transformation of base metals into gold. In this context, alchemy was a pursuit of material wealth and spiritual immortality. The core concept in traditional alchemy revolved around four elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, which were considered the foundational building blocks of nature.

In comparison, Paracelsus' Tria Principia moved beyond the traditional alchemical focus by introducing a more practical and integrated approach to alchemy. His principles connected not only with the material realm but also the spiritual and psychological aspects of reality. The Tria Principia aimed to explain the complexities of the universe and the interconnectedness of all things, rather than merely pursuing the transformation of metals.

In contrast to traditional depictions, Paracelsus' approach emphasized medical applications and the understanding of the human body and disease. He believed that a balance of Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt was critical for health and life energy, a perspective that shares common ground with modern holistic medicine.

Parallel applications of the Tria Principia in human physiology, spiritual evolution, and the natural world:

1. Human physiology: Paracelsus' principles have direct implications for our understanding of human biology. Mercury corresponds to the nervous system, circulation, and lymphatic system, providing movement and connection in the body. Sulfur represents the metabolic processes, life force, and the exchange of energies in living beings. Salt symbolizes the minerals, physical structures, and the stability that forms the basis of the physical body.

2. Spiritual evolution: Paracelsus' alchemical principles also carry spiritual implications. Mercury represents the mind and intellect, the ever-changing aspect of our consciousness. Sulfur embodies the transformative power of love, passion, and the fire of our soul's purpose. Salt signifies the grounding element of wisdom, the stable core that holds our spiritual progress together.

3. Natural world: In the natural world, the Tria Principia manifests as a microcosm of the grand pattern that governs the universe. Mercury is exhibited in the principles of fluidity and transmutation, as seen in water cycles and chemical processes. Sulfur is exemplified by the vital fires that drive change and growth, such as volcanic activity and photosynthesis. Finally, Salt emanates through the stability, order, and structure seen in crystalline formations and the arrangements of atoms and molecules.

In conclusion, Paracelsus' concept of the Tria Principia (Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt) transcended the traditional alchemical depictions by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between matter, spirit, and the universe. In comparison to the traditional alchemical focus on elemental transformation, Paracelsus integrated medicine, spirituality, and a more holistic approach to understanding the natural world. The Tria Principia has parallel applications in various domains such as human physiology, spiritual evolution, and the physical environment, showcasing the interconnectedness of all things.
