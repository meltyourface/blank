## Embracing the "Do What Thou Wilt" Philosophy in Occult Practices 

Overview
In this lesson, we delve into the foundational principles of the "Do what thou wilt" philosophy, which lies at the core of many occult practices, magical systems, and esoteric disciplines. As an aspiring occultist or student of the mystical arts, understanding this philosophy will help you to liberate yourself from the constraints of conventional thinking, accelerate your spiritual growth, and facilitate the realization of your True Will.

### I. Origin and Historical Context of "Do What Thou Wilt"

The "Do what thou wilt" philosophy traces its origins back to the medieval French theologian Fran√ßois Rabelais and his satirical work, "Gargantua and Pantagruel." However, it was English occultist and mystic Aleister Crowley who truly crystalized the concept in his Thelemic doctrine, known as "The Book of the Law." This radical principle undergirds much of modern occultism and esotericism, both in theory and in practice.

### II. The Significance of "Do What Thou Wilt" in the Esoteric Tradition

In the context of the occult and esoteric disciplines, "Do what thou wilt" stands as the ultimate expression of the individual's pursuit of self-knowledge, spiritual growth, and divine communion. The philosophy transcends any specific religious dogma or cultural context and encourages the seeker to abandon preconceived notions, societal expectations, and dogmatic creeds, in favor of forging their unique path toward enlightenment.

### III. The Principle of the True Will

Central to this doctrine is the concept of the True Will, a term seeking to capture the concept of realizing and pursuing one's genuine purpose and deepest desires. In alignment with the True Will, the individual unlocks the potential for limitless self-discovery and spiritual advancement. "Do what thou wilt," therefore, should not be misconstrued as an hedonistic or anarchic license to indulge in all whims and desires without restraint. Rather, it is a call to attune oneself to one's authentic purpose and to align one's actions, thoughts, and beliefs accordingly.

### IV. Application of the Philosophy in Various Esoteric Disciplines

The "Do what thou wilt" principle serves as the foundation for numerous esoteric practices, such as ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, and Tarot, among others. By incorporating this philosophy into their studies, practitioners aim to dismantle self-imposed limitations and restrictive thought patterns that prevent individuals from realizing their full potential and expressing their true selves.

### V. Practical Guidance for the Aspiring Occultist

As an occultist or student of the mystical arts, integrating the "Do what thou wilt" philosophy into your practice is a powerful tool for awakening your inner wisdom and facilitating your spiritual development. **The following suggestions offer practical guidance on ways to apply this principle to your studies and daily life**:

1. **Cultivate self-awareness**: Develop a deep understanding of your thoughts, emotions, and unique passions to identify your True Will.

2. **Discern between fleeting desires and lasting aspirations**: Reflect on whether your desires align with your True Will or are merely distractions from your greater purpose.

3. **Cultivate independence**: Evolve beyond societal norms, dogmas, and expectations, and create a personal system of beliefs and practices to pursue spiritual growth.

4. **Invoke spiritual guidance**: Call upon your inner guides, spirit beings, or divine forces to provide clarity and insight into your True Will.

5. **Foster continuous growth and transformation**: Embrace life's challenges, as well as the teachings of various esoteric disciplines, as opportunities to deepen your understanding of your True Will and further your spiritual development.

Conclusion

The "Do what thou wilt" philosophy offers a potent pathway for those seeking to nourish their spiritual growth and enhance their understanding of personal freedom in the context of the occult. By incorporating its principles into your studies and everyday life, you may successfully pursue your True Will and experience profound transformation within the esoteric realms.
