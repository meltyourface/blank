Introduction:
To thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, it is essential to first define the key concepts involved:

1. ****True Will****: This is a central concept in the Thelemic belief system, which is founded upon the "Do what thou wilt" philosophy by English occultist Aleister Crowley. True Will refers to an individual's innate and authentic purpose, uninhibited by cultural, familial, or societal expectations. It is the ultimate expression of self-realization and personal fulfillment.

2. ****Will to Power****: This concept, proposed by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, contends that the driving force in humans is the will to power, meaning the personal drive to achieve control over their surroundings. Nietzsche believed that the Will to Power was ultimately a creative, life-affirming force, rather than a destructive one, which defines an individual's actions and desires.

Personal Freedom and True Will:
Within the "Do what thou wilt" framework, the concept of True Will exemplifies personal freedom, as individuals are encouraged to pursue their innermost purpose without conforming to external pressures. In this sense, personal freedom aligns with Nietzsche's Will to Power theory, as both ideas emphasize the importance of pursuing one's desires rather than submitting to societal norms or expectations.

However, there is a crucial distinction between the True Will and the Will to Power. While the former focuses on discovering and pursuing one's unique path in life, the latter is concerned with dominating one's surroundings and obtaining control. Thus, the Thelemic True Will is a more individualized, self-contained concept than Nietzsche's Will to Power.

Possible Consequences in Extreme Cases:
On an individual level, taking both the True Will and the Will to Power ideologies to their extremes could lead to a heightened sense of personal freedom and fulfillment for some. For others, it may result in aberrant behavior or desires, as the drive for power or control over their surroundings might manifest in destructive ways.

In a broader societal context, these ideologies' extremes may lead to a society where individualism and self-actualization hold greater value than collective norms, traditions, or community welfare. While this might result in higher levels of creativity and innovation, it could also engender societal fragmentation or rivalry, as individuals prioritize personal power or self-realization above all else.

On another extreme, when taken too far, these philosophies might promote egoism and disdain for empathy or altruism, forging a society where the pursuit of power and personal desires become destructive, leading to the disintegration of social fabrics, civil discord, and inequality.

Summary:
In conclusion, the concept of True Will, as it pertains to the "Do what thou wilt" philosophy, emphasizes the importance of personal freedom and self-actualization. When examined alongside Nietzsche's Will to Power theory, the two ideologies share certain commonalities, such as the pursuit of personal desires and the breaking away from societal expectations. However, they also have distinct differences, with True Will being more individualized and self-contained, while the Will to Power focuses on dominating one's surroundings.

In extreme cases, both the True Will and the Will to Power could produce various consequences. On an individual level, these consequences may range from heightened personal freedom and fulfillment to destructive behavior. In a societal context, the impact of these philosophies in their extreme forms may lead to a culture that values individualism and self-actualization above collective norms, with potential implications of societal fragmentation or rivalry. Conversely, the potential for egoism and disdain for altruism could contribute to social disintegration and inequality.
