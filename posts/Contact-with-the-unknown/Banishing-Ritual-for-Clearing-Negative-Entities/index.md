The Banishing Ritual of the Ethereal Veil

1. **Detailed step-by-step process**:

a. **Purification of participants and the space**: In the afternoon before the ritual, have all participants take a ritual bath with purifying herbs, such as rosemary, lavender, and sage. Once cleansed, participants should be dressed in clean, white robes. Secure the ritual area and complete a sweeping using a besom (ritual broom) to cleanse the space of any mundane and esoteric impurities. 

b. **Invocation of protective spirits or deities**: Upon gathering the ritual tools and materials, place them upon a central altar. Begin by invoking protective spirits or deities such as Archangel Michael, Horus, or Athena. Light a white candle in their honor and call upon their protective energies through prayer or incantation. Each participant should also request the presence of their personal spirit guides or guardian angels.

2. **List of tools and materials**:

- White and black candles: They symbolize the polarity of energies. Position white candles at each cardinal point of the compass (North, South, East, West) and within the center, encircle with black candles, representing the clearing and transmutation of negativity.
- Incense (frankincense, sage, or sandalwood): It purifies the ritual space. Burn throughout the ritual.
- Salt or black salt: Create a protective barrier. Cast a circle around the ritual area using the salt.
- Sigils: Draw banishing sigils on parchment paper and place them under each candle at the cardinal points as an added layer of protection.
- Chalice filled with spring water: To cleanse the energies in the space.
- Ritual dagger or sword: Symbolize cutting ties with unwanted energies.
- Crystals (black tourmaline, obsidian, selenite): Place them around the ritual space for added protection and energy clearing.

3. Chants, invocations, or mantras:

- Chant the following mantra for protection: "Aum namah shivaya," (pronounced ow-m na-mah shiv-i-ya). Repeat this nine times while visualizing a protective white light encompassing each participant.
- To expel the entities from the space, recite the following invocation: "By the power of [protective deity/spirit], we command thee, malevolent forces and unknown entities, to leave this space and return to the realms from whence you came, never to return to harm or influence the beings or energies within. So mote it be!"

4. **Precise timeline**:

- Begin at 9 PM during a waning moon, as the decreasing lunar energies support banishing work.
- Repeated every three months to maintain the space's cleansing, preferably during a waning moon phase

5. **Specifications for participants**:

- Minimum of three participants, ideally with experience in banishing rituals or general knowledge of occult practices
- All participants should be attuned or initiated in an esoteric tradition or spiritual path to strengthen the efficacy

6. **Potential hazards and precautions**:

- Some practitioners may experience temporary lightheadedness or fatigue after the ritual. Ensure a period of rest and grounding after completion.
- Creatures or energies might try to resist banishment. Maintain emotional and mental control during the ritual to avoid being influenced.
- Have a contingency plan, such as having additional candles, incense, or sigils on hand or invoking a higher power for assistance.

7. **Indicators of success and maintenance strategies**:

- The atmosphere in the area should feel lighter, and previous signs of malevolent energy should decrease or dissipate.
- Regularly cleanse the space using sage, incense, or another preferred method
- Take note of the presence or appearance of protective spirits during meditation or dream states as a sign of their continued guardianship
- Keep a consistent spiritual practice of meditation, prayer, or protective spells to maintain the energy of the cleansed space.
