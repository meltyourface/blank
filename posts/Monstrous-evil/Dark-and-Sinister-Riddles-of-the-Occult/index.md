Riddle 1:
In darkness, we are born, from blood and silent scorn,
We twist and bind, until the willing heart is torn.
With each scream and laceration, our form begins to rise,
Yet once the deed is done, our presence they despise.
What are we?

**Answer**: Ritual scars

Riddle 2:
Through haunted woods and cursed lanes, our whispers fill the air,
An object of desire, of ruin, we share with those who dare,
When days turn black and stars align, our purpose then unfolds,
Bringing forth calamities, as the prophecy foretold.
What are we?

**Answer**: Cursed talismans

Riddle 3:
Inscribed upon the ancient walls, amidst the petrichor,
A sigil lies, forgotten, obscured by myth and lore.
It serves those who possess the skill to trace its hidden lines,
Yet condemn their souls to writhe deep within the brindled vines.
What is it?

**Answer**: Demonic glyph

Riddle 4:
Clandestine wandering through the night, we feast upon the fear,
Carrying the scent of death, we know our prey draws near.
A pact we strike, transmogrify, a grievous price to pay,
For in return, what was once mortal, now claims immortal sway.
What are we?

**Answer**: Eldritch beasts

Riddle 5:
Across the ashen plains we soar, within the putrid sky,
Our shrieks foretell the end of all, beneath the crimson eye.
We bear the weight of agony and cloaked by veil of dread,
Awoken by the seething sins, we seek the souls to shred.
What are we?

**Answer**: Spectral harbingers
