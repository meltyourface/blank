Arrangement of Beads:

The talisman will be designed in an alternating pattern composed of one tetrahedron (gold), two icosahedron (green), and three dodecahedron (violet) beads to keep the balance among the different energies and intentions. This repeating sequence will be present throughout all five sections, amplifying the synergy among the geometric shapes, numbers, color combinations.
