In the heart of the mystical world weaved with the essence of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy and the supernatural, lies a realm that defies the boundaries of ordinary existence, known as the Nietzschean Expanse. Powered by the eternal recurrence and inhabited by both extraordinary beings and supernatural manifestations, the Expanse is the ultimate fusion of the arcane and the intellectual.

Geographical Features:

The Nietzschean Expanse spans across an unfathomable territory where each landscape embodies a philosophical concept. The ground within the Expanse is an amalgamation of desolate wastelands and fertile plains, representing the harsh and fertile grounds of Nietzschean thought.

1. The Twilight Peaks: Towering mountains that cast perpetual twilight across the land, symbolizing the breaking boundaries of morality. The mountains are home to the fierce storms of the will to power, where lightning sends occasional sparks of divine inspiration.

2. The River of Metamorphosis: Flowing through the heart of the Expanse is a river that changes its course and color periodically, mirroring the process of self-overcoming and embracing the eternal recurrence.

3. The Forest of Subjectivity: An enchanted forest filled with twisted and ancient trees stands deep within the Nietzschean Expanse. Each tree intricately whispers its perspective on life into the minds of those who venture there, as the leaves emit a supernatural haze that dissolves binaries and encourages unchartered thoughts.

Arcane Significance & Landmarks:

The Nietzschean Expanse carries an aura of mythical significance, as the landscape itself is etched with mystical elements that are deeply rooted in the grand thought patterns of Nietzsche.

1. The Temple of the Übermensch: The Temple of the Übermensch sits upon the highest plateau of the Twilight Peaks. As the pinnacle of Nietzschean philosophy, the temple serves as both a sanctuary for those who have transcended their human limitations and a monumental challenge for those who aspire to reach this state.

2. The Eternal Recurrence Labyrinth: A labyrinth of ever-shifting passages rests beneath the Nietzschean Expanse, where travelers are faced with the eternal recurrence. Successfully navigating these winding paths offers one the opportunity to confront and embrace their cyclical existence, thus transcending the chains of their past selves.

Mysterious Inhabitants:

The inhabitants of the Nietzschean Expanse are both awe-inspiring and enigmatic, manifesting the philosophical concepts that shape their world.

1. The Übermensch: Representing the pinnacle of human potential, the Übermensch strides confidently through the Expanse, guiding others toward their metamorphosis. They stand taller compared to ordinary humans, possessing exceptional strength, intelligence, and spiritual fortitude.

2. Nihiliths: Shadowy beings that traverse the Expanse, sowing seeds of radical doubt and nihilistic thoughts. They challenge travelers to face the void and emerge victorious with a newfound appreciation for eternal recurrence.

3. Zarathustran Sentinels: Enlightened watchers who stand guard at the Temple of the Übermensch. They hold a wealth of knowledge and provide guidance to those ready to embark on their journey toward greatness.

The Nietzschean Expanse, an interwoven landscape of philosophy and the supernatural, acts as a living embodiment of Nietzsche's key concepts, including the Übermensch, the eternal recurrence, and the will to power. Here, each element plays its part in shaping and challenging the intrepid explorers who embark on journeys to transcendence.
