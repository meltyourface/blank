The Nietzschean Supernatural Meditation Technique (NSMT):

Begin by setting the scene in a quiet space that is neither too light nor too dark, symbolizing Nietzsche's rejection of the binary opposition of good and evil.

1. Preparation and Invocation:

- Seat yourself in a comfortable posture, cross-legged or in a chair, with a straight spine.
- Place a small object that represents the eternal return, such as a snake swallowing its own tail (ouroboros) or an hourglass, in front of you as a focus point.
- Optional: Light a black (representing nihilism) and white (representing rebirth) candle on either side of the central object.

Begin by taking several deep breaths and mentally reciting the following invocation to embrace Nietzsche's concept of the Übermensch:

"By the will and wisdom of the eternal return, I invoke the spirit of the Übermensch. I shed the chains of conventional morality, embrace the inherent complexities of my being, and seek the transformative power of the Nietzschean Supernatural."

2. Silencing the Herd:

This stage of meditation aims to silence the cacophony of societal norms and expectations and attune your mind to your inner will.

- Close your eyes and visualize a vast, quiet forest. This represents the isolation Nietzsche valued for self-reflection.
- From the distance, imagine the sounds of a chaotic crowd gathering. As the sounds intensify, acknowledge the phrases and judgments imposed by this metaphorical herd.
- Now, as you exhale, imagine a dark cloud from your mouth that engulfs the crowd. With every breath, the herd becomes quieter until the sound disappears and peace is restored to your inner domain.

3. Practice of Self-Creation:

In this stage, you engage in active self-creation, similar to Nietzsche's concept of self-overcoming.

- Visualize yourself standing before an ancient altar with a golden chalice, symbolizing the transformation of base elements into gold (alchemy).
- Begin to reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, and the dualities you possess. Pour these aspects of yourself into the chalice.
- As you create an honest self-portrait, imagine a mystical fire igniting below the chalice, purifying and amalgamating the contents, merging contradictory forces, and creating a transcendent and unified essence.
- Allow this transformative process to take time and be thorough.

4. Embrace the Eternal Return:

Contemplate the eternal return, Nietzsche's renowned concept. Ask yourself, "If I had to relive my actions endlessly, would I continue to act the same way?"

- Connect to the object set in front of you and mentally project your transformed self onto the symbol of eternal return.
- Visualize a cycle of time revolving around your essence where events, choices, and actions continue to recur ad infinitum.
- As you intellectually engage with this loop, sincerely accept these cycles as your path to transcendence.

5. Closing and Integration:

Conclude the meditation by saying:

"My inner will is aligned with the Nietzschean Supernatural. I shall embody the values of the Übermensch in my actions and thoughts, accepting the eternal return's wisdom."

Gradually open your eyes and take a few more deep breaths, reflecting on the transformative experience.

Practice this meditation consistently to forge a deeper connection to the supernatural aspects of Nietzschean philosophy and unlock the metaphysical potential within yourself.
