Task: Compose an intricate protection ritual involving the evocation of planetary energies and utilizing their corresponding symbols to safeguard a chosen individual, location, or object. Incorporate the specific sigils of Mars for courage, Saturn for discipline, and Mercury for mental agility.

The Celestial Triad Protection Ritual

This protection ritual taps into the energies of Mars, Saturn, and Mercury to create a powerful shield for a chosen individual, location, or object. By combining the bold energy and courage of Mars, the steadfast discipline of Saturn, and the agile adaptability of Mercury, this ritual provides robust protection against both physical and spiritual harm.

**Preparation**:

1. Choose a time when Mars, Saturn, and Mercury are in favorable positions in the sky, creating a supportive triangle. This will usually occur during a clear night when these planets are visible, and the moon is either waxing or full.

2. If possible, perform the ritual on a Tuesday (Mars' day), Saturday (Saturn's day), or Wednesday (Mercury's day) for added harmony with the planetary energies.

3. Cleanse the space in which the ritual will take place. This can be done by burning sage or incense (frankincense, myrrh, or dragon's blood are particularly suitable). Sprinkle saltwater around the area in a clockwise direction to create a purified environment.

4. Gather the following ritual tools and offerings:
   - Three black candles (representing the planets Mars, Saturn, and Mercury)
   - A small dish of salt (for purification and grounding)
   - A chalice of water (to represent the connection with planetary energies)
   - A ritual knife or dagger (to channel personal will and symbolize the warrior aspect of Mars)
   - A piece of lead (to represent the discipline and stability of Saturn)
   - A small mirror (to symbolize the mental agility and communication of Mercury)
   - Incense (frankincense, myrrh or dragon's blood) for purification and to invoke the presence of guardian spirits
   
5. On a flat surface or altar, create a triangle using the three candles. In the center, place the dish of salt, chalice of water, and ritual knife or dagger. Arrange the lead and mirror on either side of the central triangle.

6. Draw the sigils of Mars, Saturn, and Mercury on separate pieces of parchment or cardstock. Place them next to their corresponding candles (Mars – red candle, Saturn – black candle, Mercury – silver candle).

The Ritual:

1. Stand at the edge of the cleansed space and take a few deep breaths to center yourself. Allow your mind to focus on the intention of protection.

2. Light the three candles, beginning with Mars, then Saturn, and finally Mercury. As you light each candle, visualize the planet's energy entering the triangle and merging with the previous energies.

3. Light the incense and take a moment to invite your guardian spirits or protective energies to join you in the ritual.

4. Mix a pinch of salt with the water in the chalice and cleanse the lead and mirror by sprinkling the water over them.

5. Pick up the ritual knife or dagger and, with focused intention, draw a line between the Mars and Saturn sigils, connecting the energy of courage with discipline.

6. Draw another line to connect the Saturn and Mercury sigils, linking the energies of discipline and mental agility.

7. Complete the triangle by drawing a line between the Mercury and Mars sigils, creating a dynamic and powerful flow of planetary energies.

8. Speak a sincere invocation, such as:

"I call upon the celestial guardians, the powers of Mars, Saturn, and Mercury, to form a potent shield and empower [individual/object/location] with courage, discipline, and mental agility. Protect and fortify against harm, seen and unseen. As above, so below. As within, so without. So it is."

9. Allow the candles to burn down, meditating on the ritual's intention. When the candles are finished, carefully collect and bury the wax and any remaining objects in the earth outside.

10. Close the ritual by thanking the planets, guardian spirits, and protective energies for their assistance, and extinguish the incense. The Celestial Triad Protection Ritual is now complete.
