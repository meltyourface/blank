excerpt: In the context of three ancient civilizations that have mysteriously vanished from history, connect the dissimilarities and underlying esoteric motifs found in their obscure lore to propose a unifying theory that could account for their simultaneous disappearance and propose a plausible metaphysical nexus between them.

To address this challenge, let us first select three ancient civilizations that have mysteriously vanished from history. We will focus on the Minoans of Crete, the Indus Valley Civilization, and the Olmec Civilization in Mesoamerica. While these civilizations vanished for ostensibly different reasons, it is worth noting certain dissimilarities and underlying esoteric motifs within their respective lore to propose a possible unifying theory that could account for their simultaneous disappearance, and also suggest a plausible metaphysical nexus between them.

The Minoans, an ancient civilization on the island of Crete, seemingly vanished after a series of natural disasters in 1500 BCE. They left behind intricate art and architecture, reflecting a sophisticated and complex culture. The Indus Valley Civilization, located in what is now Pakistan and India, mysteriously vanished around 1900 BCE. Known for their advanced urban planning and technological prowess, they left behind a non-decipherable script. The Olmecs, the earliest known Mesoamerican civilization, existed from 1400 BCE to 400 BCE, and they left colossal stone head statues, but very little is known about their cultural practices.

Now, let us investigate some prominent esoteric motifs and dissimilarities within their lore and practices. 

1. Minoan civilization: Minoan art is replete with mythological creatures and symbols, such as the Minotaur - a half-man, half-bull creature, and the double-headed axe or Labrys, a symbol of power and a possible representation of a deity in Minoan religion. The labyrinth, associated with the Minotaur, represents a model of complexity and enigma. 

2. Indus Valley Civilization: Due to the enigmatic script that remains undeciphered, the true meaning of various symbols in this civilization is unclear. However, seals depicting animal and human figures with multiple heads have led some to propose evidence of proto-Hinduism and the concept of Shakti - an embodiment of divine feminine power.

3. Olmec civilization: The Olmecs left behind colossal stone head statues, some measuring up to 9 feet in height, possibly representing rulers and deities. Their religion appears to incorporate shamanistic elements, with a focus on animal-human transformations, serpent imagery, and connection to primordial forces. 

We can now attempt to connect the dissimilarities and underlying esoteric motifs to propose our unifying theory for their simultaneous disappearance. Each of these civilizations had distinctive motifs that represent enigmatic complexities and transformative aspects in a divine or metaphysical sense - the labyrinth of Minoans, the concept of Shakti in Indus Valley Civilization, and the transformative shamanic practices of the Olmecs.

Taking these into consideration, one plausible unifying theory is that each civilization had access to a shared, esoteric knowledge related to cycles of transformation and rebirth. The supernatural forces associated with their motifs may have served as a metaphysical nexus, enabling these civilizations to communicate, exchange knowledge, and utilize the hidden forces of metaphysical transformation.

In conclusion, while the Minoans of Crete, the Indus Valley Civilization, and the Olmec Civilization in Mesoamerica have disappeared from history and exhibit unique dissimilarities, the esoteric motifs in their lore reveal certain similarities, such as the concepts of enigma, complexity, and transformative elements. By connecting these motifs, we can propose a unifying theory of shared esoteric knowledge that could potentially explain their simultaneous disappearance. This proposal also suggests the existence of a plausible metaphysical nexus between them, perhaps as a testament to the depths of hidden knowledge that once connected various ancient cultures in their quest for spiritual enlightenment and understanding.
