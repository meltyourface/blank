In order to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of "Liber 777" and "Sepher Sephiroth," it is crucial to examine these texts through the lens of the Septenary current. Both texts have a profound impact on Western esotericism and are notable for their rich symbolism and intricate correspondences.

1. **Symbolism and Associations**:

"Liber 777" is a comprehensive exploration of several aspects of the Septenary system. Aleister Crowley, the text's author, compiled an extensive array of correspondences linking various entities, symbols, colors, and concepts to the sephiroth, providing a practical guide for magicians and occultists. The work focuses on the Tree of Life and primarily explores its connections to numerous esoteric practices.

On the other hand, "Sepher Sephiroth" delves into the numerological and gematrial associations of the Hebrew alphabet, offering a detailed analysis of each letter's significance within the Septenary system. While its symbolism is more abstract than "Liber 777," it enables seekers to decode various esoteric texts and uncover hidden meanings within scriptural passages.

2. **Qliphothic Forces and Averse Aspects**:

"Liber 777" acknowledges the qliphothic forces and their roles within the Septenary current but does not delve entirely into their nature. These forces are often considered as the unbalanced, dark, or destructive counterparts to the sephiroth and are used to understand several elements of the spiritual journey.

In contrast, "Sepher Sephiroth" offers more information regarding the qliphothic forces and the averse aspects of the Septenary system. It places a strong emphasis on the Sitra Achra, the "Other Side," which encompasses a myriad of dark forces, fallen angels, and demons. This work highlights the significance of balancing both sides of the Tree of Life, emphasizing the necessity of understanding the qliphothic realm to successfully navigate the spiritual path.

3. **Numerological and Gematrial Correspondences**:

Both texts present unique aspects related to numerology and gematria, though "Sepher Sephiroth" prioritizes these correspondences more than "Liber 777" does. The latter work focuses on connecting sephiroth to various symbols, occasionally incorporating numerology and gematria to reinforce these associations.

"Sepher Sephiroth" is fundamentally a numerological and gematrial exploration of the Hebrew alphabet, meticulously examining the numerical value of each letter. This text offers insight into the Septenary system by studying the numerical relationships between words and their symbolic significance, leading to a deep understanding of hidden meanings and esoteric doctrines.

4. **Practical Applications**:

"Liber 777" is a practical resource for magicians, providing an accessible reference for various esoteric practices such as tarot, astrology, and invocation. The text is designed to enable practitioners to quickly find correspondences relevant to their work and facilitate their understanding of intricate relationships between symbols and the sephiroth.

While "Sepher Sephiroth" is more abstract, it also has practical implications for those who study Kabbalah, the Tree of Life, and gematria. This work encourages students to uncover hidden meanings and understand the relationships between esoteric concepts. Both texts contribute to personal gnosis and spiritual growth within the Septenary current by providing different perspectives and methods of understanding.

5. **Doctrines and Historical Influences**:

"Liber 777" originates from Crowley's Western occult and magical practices and is deeply connected to Thelema's philosophy and system. It draws from influences such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, augmenting several practices to fit the Thelemic framework. "Sepher Sephiroth" has a more traditional, Kabbalistic focus, emphasizing the esoteric teachings of Jewish mysticism and its historical contribution to the Septenary system.

Overall, both "Liber 777" and "Sepher Sephiroth" play significant roles in the contemporary occult landscape, contributing to the understanding and dissemination of the Septenary current. Despite their differences in focus and symbolism, these texts complement each other by providing unique insights into the intricate correspondences and practices that have shaped Western esotericism. They ultimately enrich the spiritual journey of magicians and occultists.
