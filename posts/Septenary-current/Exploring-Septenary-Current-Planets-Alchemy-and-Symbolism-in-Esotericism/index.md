In order to effectively respond to this knowledge challenge, it is first necessary to briefly introduce the primary concepts involved: the Septenary current, the seven traditional planets, the alchemical process, and sevenfold symbolism in diverse esoteric systems. We will then proceed to establish their interrelations within the broader framework of esoteric thought, focusing especially on their manifestations in the macrocosm and microcosm.

The Septenary current refers to the esoteric tradition that highlights the significance of the number seven across various systems, practices, and doctrines. It is a unifying thread across different cultural and historical developments, such as the Hermetic, Kabbalistic, and Neoplatonic traditions, to name a few.

The seven traditional planets are the astral bodies that were recognized by ancient cultures as having a powerful influence on human affairs. The list includes the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Each of these celestial entities corresponds to different archetypal energies, characteristics, and affects our lives through astrological configurations.

The alchemical process is a series of operations seeking the transmutation of base substances into higher states or the production of the Philosopher's Stone, an elusive substance said to grant spiritual mastery and immortality. The process itself is symbolically rich and rife with esoteric themes present in various stages of spiritual transformation.

Sevenfold symbolism is a core aspect of many esoteric systems, manifesting in different structures, such as the seven chakras in Yoga, the seven spheres of the Tree of Life in Kabbalah, or the seven rays in Theosophy.

Now, let us delve into the interrelation between the seven traditional planets, the alchemical process, and the significance of sevenfold symbolism in diverse esoteric systems by examining their multi-dimensional aspects in the macrocosm and microcosm.

1. **Macrocosm**: In the grand scheme of the universe, the septenary current manifests as the seven traditional planets, each embodying distinct cosmological principles and archetypal energies. As such, the planets' characteristics reflect the various stages of the alchemical process and the different phases of spiritual development required to achieve the Great Work.
For instance, the Moon corresponds to the initial stage of alchemy—nigredo or blackening—which represents psychological dissolution and the beginning of one's inner journey. Conversely, the Sun symbolizes the final stage—rubedo or reddening—indicating the harmonization of opposites, wholeness, and spiritual illumination. The other planets and their associated stages similarly follow this septenary structure.

2. **Microcosm**: Within the human being, the interrelation between these concepts is evident in the septenary composition of their spiritual anatomy. The seven Chakras, for example, are viewed as energy centers interwoven with the psyche and body. Each chakra is correlated with a planet and a particular stage in the alchemical process. To awaken and balance the chakras is, in a sense, to undergo a personal alchemical transformation and realize one's divine potential.

Moreover, the sevenfold symbolism finds a home in the microcosmic framework of personal experience and development, as reflected in the various initiatory rites and mystery schools. Here, the aspirant advances through successive levels of initiation, often structured in septenary patterns, seeking self-mastery and unveiling deeper aspects of reality.

In summary, the interrelation between the seven traditional planets, the alchemical process, and the significance of sevenfold symbolism in diverse esoteric systems is a complex, multi-layered tapestry woven throughout the fabric of the macrocosm and microcosm. The Septenary current unifies these elements into a coherent paradigm that highlights the richness of esoteric knowledge and provides a framework for understanding spiritual transformation and its manifestations across various cultural and historical contexts.
