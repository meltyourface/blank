description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Septenary current, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Compose an intricate hymn dedicated to a specific deity within the Graeco-Egyptian magical tradition, specifically focusing on the Septenary current. Incorporate esoteric symbolism and coded language to express the deity's traits and domains, as well as the practitioner's relationship with the divine. For instance, if the deity is Thoth, highlight wisdom and writing, and make use of Hermetic principles, numerological significances, and alchemical elements. Integrate musical elements and progression to evoke the power and energy associated with the chosen deity in the performance of the hymn, ultimately deepening the spiritual connection and evoking the presence of the deity within a ritualistic context.

Deity: Thoth, God of Knowledge and Wisdom

Title: Hymn to the Sacred Ibis

### I. Invocation

Rise, O sacred Ibis, in the vessel of night,
Heralded by Mercury's swift radiant light;
In septenary tongue, we conjure thee,
O Thoth, divine revealer, of secrets and mastery.

With pen and scroll, we trace the serpentine path,
Numbers and symbols form the cosmic paragraph;
Guide us through your labyrinth, wise magus of yore,
By earth and air, thy wisdom we implore!

### II. Adoration

Refrain:
Praise, O praise, the sacred Ibis;
In his gilded beak, he holds the key,
Unlocking vast domains of numinous lore,
Thus, to the realm of mystery, we soar.

Winged harbinger of the Hermetic flame,
In thy arcane words, we find our aim;
Through fire and water we gaze, with deep intent,
The Prima Materia to seize and augment.

Refrain:
Praise, O praise, the sacred Ibis;
In his gilded beak, he holds the key,
Unlocking vast domains of numinous lore,
Thus, to the realm of mystery, we soar.

### III. Consecration

Three, the number of unity divine,
Subtle triad enfolding in paradigm;
Bound by the fabled cord of Hermes true,
Magic and alchemy ignite and renew.

Seven, the cycle complete and refined,
Symbol of harmonic celestial design;
By your wisdom, O Thoth, teach us to conjoin,
Septenary currents, in transcendent align.

### IV. Benediction

O sacred Ibis, to your wisdom, we do cry,
In celestial council, you guide us from on high;
Illuminate our path, enlightener of the way,
So that in your likeness, we may shine forth one day.

Refrain:
Praise, O praise, the sacred Ibis;
In his gilded beak, he holds the key,
Unlocking vast domains of numinous lore,
Thus, to the realm of mystery, we soar.

With every note and phrase, we are elevated higher,
Summoning forth the eternal Hermetic fire;
In deep communion, our souls exalted sing,
The presence of Thoth, through this hymn we bring.
