To fully understand the underlying philosophical tenets of LaVeyan Satanism, The Temple of Set, and the Satanic Temple and their different interpretations of Satanism, we must first delve into the historical and ideological contexts of these organizations. By analyzing their teachings, we can better understand the core philosophies, their approaches towards morality, personal freedom, and responsible societal engagement.

- LaVeyan Satanism: 

Founded in 1966 by Anton LaVey, LaVeyan Satanism, also known as the Church of Satan, is perhaps the most well-known modern Satanic organization. It is an atheistic religion that champions individualism, egoism, self-preservation, and personal gratification. LaVeyan Satanism draws inspiration from philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, and H. L. Mencken, and is often viewed as a reaction against restrictive religious and societal norms.

Morality in LaVeyan Satanism is based primarily on the "Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth" and the "Nine Satanic Statements." These guidelines encourage rational self-interest, empathy towards those who deserve it, and vindictive justice towards one's enemies. The morality of LaVeyan Satanism is subjective and situational, meaning ethical decisions come from the individual's values and beliefs. This framework emphasizes personal autonomy and freedom.

LaVeyan Satanism's approach towards societal engagement can be described as pragmatic. The Church of Satan encourages its members to work within the framework of the existing legal and social systems to advance their individual goals. It invites followers to critically evaluate the societies they live in and adapt to or change them accordingly.

- The Temple of Set:

The Temple of Set was founded in 1975 by Michael A. Aquino, a former member of the Church of Satan. The Temple of Set is a theistic religion and its practitioners, known as Setians, view Set as a real metaphysical being, who represents consciousness, individualism, and the pursuit of self-deification through knowledge and self-mastery.

Morality in the Temple of Set revolves around the concept of Xeper, an ancient Egyptian word meaning "to come into being." Setians believe in continuous self-improvement and the development of one's intellectual, emotional, and physical potential. The temple's guiding principle, the "Law of Thelema," encourages followers to "do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This implies that followers should act according to their True Will by tapping into their authentic desires and essential nature.

When it comes to societal engagement, Setians advocate for the transformation and improvement of society through individual achievement and excellence. Unlike LaVeyan Satanists, they focus more on transcending the limitations of societal norms and conventions rather than simply working within them.

- The Satanic Temple:

The Satanic Temple (TST), founded in 2013 by Lucien Greaves and Malcolm Jarry, is a non-theistic organization that uses the metaphor of Satan as a figurehead representing rebellion, reason, and personal sovereignty. They embody activism, social justice, and egalitarianism. The Satanic Temple is primarily a political movement that leverages religious freedom to challenge unjust laws and discriminatory policies.

TST has codified their moral beliefs in the "Seven Tenets," which are a set of affirmative principles that promote compassion, wisdom, personal freedom, and justice. For the Satanic Temple, morality is also largely situational, with a focus on context, empathy, and reason.

The Satanic Temple engages profoundly with society. Members often participate in public demonstrations, legal battles, and political activism to promote secularism, religious freedom, and social justice.

In summary, all three organizations differ in their philosophical beliefs. LaVeyan Satanism emphasizes individualism and self-preservation, the Temple of Set advocates self-deification through the pursuit of knowledge, and The Satanic Temple pushes for activism and social change. While there are overlaps in their approaches towards morality and personal freedom, they differ in how they engage with society. LaVeyan Satanism and the Temple of Set are more internally focused, seeking personal empowerment and transformation, while The Satanic Temple actively engages in promoting societal change and equal rights.
