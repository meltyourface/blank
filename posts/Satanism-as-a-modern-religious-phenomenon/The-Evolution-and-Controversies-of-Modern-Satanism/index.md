Modern Satanism as a religious phenomenon has grown significantly since the mid-20th century, evolving into a complex and varied belief system with multiple organizations, ideologies, and practices. Its influence within contemporary society can be analyzed from both ideological and organizational aspects, as well as from the standpoint of the dynamics between Satanic groups and traditional religious institutions.

One notable example of modern Satanism is Anton Szandor LaVey's Church of Satan, founded in 1966. LaVey's Satanism focuses on individualism, egoism, and self-worship, providing a contrast to the self-sacrifice and humility advocated by traditional religions. The Satanic Bible, written by LaVey, is the foundational text for this form of Satanism and includes key tenets such as indulgence, vital existence, undefiled wisdom, and responsibility to oneself.

The Temple of Set, another Satanic organization, emerged in 1975 from the Church of Satan. This group emphasizes the exploration of the self and self-deification through a process known as Xeper ("becoming" or "growth"). The Temple of Set regards Set, the Egyptian god of darkness and chaos, as a symbol of self-discovery and enlightenment.

On the other hand, The Satanic Temple, established in 2013, is a non-theistic organization that focuses on political activism, social justice, and secularism. Its adherents use satanic imagery and symbolism to challenge the dominance of religious institutions in the public sphere, advocate for the separation of church and state, and defend individual freedoms.

The dynamics between modern Satanic groups and traditional religious institutions range from contentious to cooperative. The Church of Satan, for example, is often criticized by Christians for its perceived blasphemy and mockery of Christian beliefs, as well as its promotion of hedonistic and egoistic values. However, The Satanic Temple seeks to find common ground with traditional religious institutions when it comes to advocating for social justice and civil liberties.

Satanic practices, rituals, and beliefs are diverse, but they generally involve embracing the self and challenging dogmatic beliefs. They may include rituals such as the "Infernal Benediction," which symbolizes the liberation of the individual from societal constraints, or the "Black Mass," a parodic inversion of the Christian Mass designed to celebrate individualism and freedom. In contrast, conventional faiths generally promote humility, submission to a higher power, and adherence to established moral principles.

The socio-political implications of the rise of modern Satanism are multifaceted. Some see it as a rebellious force challenging the hold of traditional religious institutions on society and providing a voice for individualism and self-expression. At the same time, this rise has led to increased conflicts over the role of religion in the public sphere, as seen in legal battles over religious monuments and public prayers.

There are both conflicts and potential synthesis between modern Satanism and mainstream religious perspectives. While Satanic ideology explicitly rejects certain tenets of conventional faiths, such as submission to a higher power, it may share some common ground with these faiths in terms of advocating for social justice, personal development, and individual freedom. Ultimately, the rise of modern Satanism and its influence within the context of contemporary society can be seen as a reflection of ongoing debates regarding the role of religion, spirituality, and individual expression in our increasingly pluralistic world.
