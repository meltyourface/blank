## I. Ritual Preparation

1. Thoroughly cleanse the space to be used for the invocation, eliminating all negative energies and influences to nurture a tranquil atmosphere.

2. **Arrange the necessary ritual tools and materials within this sacred space. These may include**:
  - A white or natural-colored altar cloth
  - An athame or ritual knife
  - A chalice filled with pure water
  - Incense (preferably frankincense or myrrh)
  - One white, black, and purple candle
  - A compass
  - A piece of parchment
  - A pen with consecrated ink (preferably dragon's blood)

### II. Preparation of the Ritual Space

1. Draw a circle, large enough for you to stand comfortably within, on the floor with the compass.

2. Create a Qabalistic Tree of Life within the circle by drawing ten spheres, or Sephiroth, connected by the twenty-two paths. Label each sphere according to the associated Hebrew name, and color coordinate them according to their respective positions on the Tree.

3. Place the white candle in Keter, the black candle in Malkuth, and the purple candle in Tiphereth.

4. Set up an altar at the edge of the circle, and arrange the other ritual tools and materials accordingly.

### III. Invocation of the Archangels and En Sof

1. Stand at the center of the circle, facing east, and take a few moments to center yourself and visualize your connection with the En Sof, or the limitless divine energy of the universe.

2. ****Light the incense, and proceed to invoke the four directional Archangels****: 
  - Raphael in the East
  - Gabriel in the West
  - Michael in the South
  - Uriel in the North
  
3. **Speak the following invocation**:
   "Ateh Gibor Le-olam Adonai, in the name of the En Sof and the divine energies that permeate the universe, I invoke the powers of the Archangels Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, and Uriel. May your presence fill this sacred space and guard its boundaries from all malevolent forces."

4. Meditate on their energies and visualize a Tetragrammaton (YHVH) surrounding your circle, emanating from the Tree of Life.

### IV. Crafting the Personal Shielding Sigil

1. On parchment, draw your personalized sigil by combining the letters of a chosen protective phrase (e.g., "I am protected by the divine force") in an artistic and meaningful design.

2. **Hold the sigil over the three candles and recite the following incantation**:
   "By the powers of Keter, Tiphereth, and Malkuth, and the divine light of the En Sof that illuminates all creation, I consecrate this sigil as my personal shield against all harm and malevolence."

3. Anoint the sigil with a drop of water from the chalice, and let the parchment dry.

### V. Finalizing the Invocation

1. **Hold the sigil to your chest and say**:
   "Let this shield be my armor against any negative energies, illnesses, or malevolent forces, and existing within the divine grace of the limitless En Sof. May the Archangels watch over me and protect me, now and forever."

2. Carry or wear the sigil on your person as a symbol of your newly crafted spiritual protection.

3. To conclude the ritual, thank the Archangels for their guidance and protection, and extinguish the three candles.

This intricate Solomonic invocation, infused with En Sof principles, provides a potent personal shield against metaphysical threats and malevolent forces, utilizing the wisdom of ancient traditions and harmonizing them with a contemporary understanding of energetic protection.
