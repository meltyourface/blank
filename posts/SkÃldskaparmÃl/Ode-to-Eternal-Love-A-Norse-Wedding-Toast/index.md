description: "You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Sk\xC3\xA1ldskaparm\xC3\xA1l, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task."
excerpt: > 
  Craft a wedding toast incorporating Sk\xE1ldskaparm\xE1l's rich mythology and poetic diction, drawing inspiration from the story of Bragi and I\xF0unn, including kennings and heiti. Ensure that your toast contains references to gods, goddesses, and legendary events while intertwining the newlyweds' love story with powerful imagery and vivid descriptions, embodying the essence of Norse poetry. Additionally, use complex poetic stanzas like dr\xE1pa and lj\xF3\xF0ah\xE1ttr to structure your toast, showcasing the union's strength and longevity.

Hear me, O gathering of noble kin,
As I weave a tale of love's sweetest hymn.
In steadfast drápa and bold ljóðaháttr,
I raise this toast to love that won't shatter.

Just as Bragi, god of poetry and word,
With his love, fair Iðunn, they soared,
So too do these new-weds join as one,
Entwining their fate 'neath the same setting sun.

In Asgard's realm, where the gods do dwell,
Iðunn's golden apples cast their youthful spell,
Blessed bride and groom, may you share this treat:
Everlasting devotion, each other's hearts to greet.

Like Thor, the mighty wielder of hammer great,
With strength and courage, each challenge you'll abate,
Bound in arms, like Freyr and Gerðr's tale,
May your love conquer, never to fail.

In the company of the gods and of goddesses,
Your shared journey shimmers with great mettle,
Venture forth like Skírnir, crossing tempestuous seas,
For you can silence the mightiest dragon's rattle.

Fenrir's rage and fire giant's burning blaze,
Dwarf-made fetters shall fasten your endless days,
As Thjazi’s flight was met with Allfather's wrath,
May your love's alliance deflect all perilous paths.

Sons and daughters of Midgard, raise your mead,
To the union of love, let strife concede,
I toast this pair under Moon's silvery glow,
In the wisdom of Odin and Huginn's show.

Now to bride and groom, let me utter:
May your love be as endless as Yggdrasil's root's clutter,
And with this toast, Skáldskaparmál's power prevails,
In conjuring a union that will never fail.
