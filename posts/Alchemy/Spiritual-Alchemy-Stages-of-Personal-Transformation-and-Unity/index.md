To answer this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the basics of spiritual alchemical transmutation and the esoteric concepts of Sol and Luna. Alchemy, an ancient practice that predates modern chemistry, sought to transmute base metals into gold, find the Elixir of Life, and achieve spiritual enlightenment. Throughout its history, alchemy has had both practical and spiritual applications, with spiritual alchemy being rooted in the idea of personal transformation and growth. 

Spiritual alchemical transmutation involves three primary phases: Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo. Each phase is intricately related and represents the stages of transformation on the path to spiritual enlightenment. The esoteric concepts of Sol and Luna symbolize the sun (masculine) and moon (feminine) aspects, and they embody the duality and polarity of the universe. These elements are crucial in understanding the alchemical process. Now, let's explore each phase and their relationship with Sol and Luna, as well as the significance of the peacock's tail.

1. Nigredo: The first phase of the alchemical transmutation is Nigredo or the blackening. In this stage, the practitioner faces their own darkness, confronting their fears, traumas, and shadow aspects. This confrontation results in a metaphorical "death" of one's ego, symbolizing sacrifice, suffering, and purification. In terms of Sol and Luna, Nigredo aligns with Luna's dark aspects representing disintegration and decay that oppose Sol's illuminating qualities. This phase is crucial as it lays the foundation for achieving spiritual growth.

2. Albedo: The second phase, Albedo, refers to the purification or whitening stage. After delving into the darkness of the Nigredo phase, the practitioner must now reassemble the fragmented pieces of their soul and psyche, healing and purifying themselves. Here, Sol and Luna come together, representing the interplay of opposites, duality, and harmony, paving the way for the union of the masculine and feminine aspects within oneself. The peacock's tail prominently appears during this stage, symbolizing a transformation marked by an array of iridescent colors. It represents the first glimpse of spiritual illumination, the inner light that will eventually lead to enlightenment.

3. Rubedo: The final stage is Rubedo, the reddening, signifying the spiritual synthesis and completion of the alchemical opus. In this phase, the purified elements of the self, now imbued with the spiritual light from Albedo, are brought into a union. This union, known as the "alchemical marriage," symbolizes the fusion of the sun (Sol) and moon (Luna), the masculine and feminine aspects of being. Achieving wholeness and integration on all levels allows the practitioner to reach a heightened state of spiritual enlightenment and embody the philosopher's stone, the ultimate goal of spiritual alchemy.

In summary, the phases of spiritual alchemical transmutation, Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo, are deeply intertwined with the esoteric concepts of Sol and Luna, representing the journey through darkness and purification to achieve spiritual enlightenment. The peacock's tail symbolizes the first indication of spiritual light and harmony within oneself during the Albedo stage, laying the foundation for the final unification of Sol and Luna in the Rubedo phase. Ultimately, the alchemical process reveals the essential truth of self-awareness, spiritual growth, and the transformative power within us all.
