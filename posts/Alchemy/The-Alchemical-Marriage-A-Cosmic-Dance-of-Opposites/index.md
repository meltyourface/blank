In the hidden twilight, where dual forces blend,
A sacred marriage doth celestial paths portend,
The Sun King and Moon Queen, their tale profound,
A mystic union of opposites, where truths abound.

Drawn in flames of gold and streams of argent,
Their alchemy dances amidst the stardust lament,
Nigredo's shadow shrouds the primal stage,
Dark chaos unearths, where bright origins engage.

A dream of ashes, a tomb of ravens' throne,
Yet deep within, a hidden seed is sown,
Albedo whispers, reflections glistening there,
Purifying opposites, unveiling the subtle lair.

A peacock's tail, a myriad of hues,
Revives the soul, so long subdued,
Citrinitas, Auroras light doth rush,
Golden dawn alights, in fiery hush.

The door of miracles opens, as our phoenix ascends,
Rubedo declares the exalted end,
Red and white stone, married in divine embrace,
The Philosopher's gift, a beacon of alchemical grace.

Voyaging through these ancient corridors of mind,
In inner temples, the wanderer shall find,
The mastery of self, where immortal light is born,
A cosmic harmony, transcending the mundane scorn.

Thus it is revealed, the secret of the sage,
A sacred dance, a timeless cosmic page,
In every seeking heart, their echoes resonate,
The Alchemical Marriage, a union to illuminate.
