Mercury, Sulfur, Salt, Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, Coagulation

The process of alchemical transmutation, specifically to produce the Philosopher's Stone, is rooted in a deep understanding of the elements, principles, and stages involved. The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance in alchemy capable of turning base metals into gold and conferring immortality via the Elixir of Life.

The option Mercury, Sulfur, Salt, Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, Coagulation is the accurate combination as it encompasses the essential elements, principles, and stages necessary for the Philosopher's Stone.

**Elements**:
1. Mercury: Representing the spirit or volatility, Mercury is the life force, often ascribed to the animating principle.
2. Sulfur: Representing the soul, Sulfur is the aspect of binding and stabilizing. It is connected to the essence of the thing being transmuted.
3. Salt: Representing the body and the principles of form and matter, Salt hosts the operation carried out on it. It acts as a receptacle for the process.

**Principles**:
- The Triad of Unity: The interplay of Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt constitutes the triad of unity that maintains a balance between opposing forces, allowing the alchemical process to proceed.

**Stages**:
1. Calcination: The first stage, involving heating a substance to reduce it to ashes or powder. It symbolizes the purification and burning away of impurities.
2. Dissolution: This stage dissolves the remaining residues in liquid, allowing for a deeper level of purification by breaking down and releasing the substance's hidden essence.
3. Separation: The process of isolating the vital components from the purified material, letting go of the unneeded parts.
4. Conjunction: The union of opposites, such as masculine and feminine, to create a new harmonized entity.
5. Fermentation: The breakdown and decay of organic matter, resulting in new life and rebirth of the substance.
6. Distillation: The refinement and purification of the substance, often through evaporation and condensation.
7. Coagulation: The final stage is solidifying the substance to achieve a stable and perfected form.

Taken together, these elements, principles, and stages form a comprehensive and systematic process necessary to produce the Philosopher's Stone. This intricate process is employed by alchemists in the pursuit of wisdom and deeper understanding of the cosmic and internal workings of reality.
