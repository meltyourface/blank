  - Sulfur, representing the soul, corresponds to Air and Hot and Moist properties, and is linked with the Spirit component of the human body; Salt, symbolizing the body, corresponds to Earth and Cold and Dry properties, and is associated with the Mind; Mercury, as a catalyst, represents Spirit and is associated with Fire and Water, Hot and Cold properties, as well as connected to the Body.

**Explanation**:
In the realm of Alchemy, the three primes, also known as the Tria Prima, are Sulfur, Salt, and Mercury. These primes are essential components in Alchemy and are considered the foundation of understanding how substances interact and change.

Sulfur is traditionally considered representing the soul and is associated with the element of Fire. Fire, in turn, has Hot and Dry properties. In the context of the human body, Sulfur is linked with the Mind component, signifying the essence and ideas of a person. This association comes from the belief that the soul or consciousness resides in the mind and is fueled by the fire of passion, creativity, and enthusiasm.

Salt symbolizes the body and is related to the element of Earth, which has Cold and Dry properties. Earth represents stability, groundedness, and the physical realm. In the human body, Salt is associated with the Physical, as it is believed to form the basis of all matter and provide the structure and stability needed for the material body itself.

Mercury is the catalyst in alchemical processes and, as such, represents the Spirit. It acts as a bridge between the soul (Sulfur) and the body (Salt), allowing for the transformation of one into the other. Mercury is associated with both Air and Water elements due to its dualistic nature, representing a balance between opposites. Air and Water both possess Hot and Moist properties. In the context of the human body, Mercury is connected to the Soul, as it represents spiritual growth and evolution that is made possible by the harmony between the physical (Salt) and mental (Sulfur) aspects of a person.

In conclusion, by understanding the relationships between the three primes, the corresponding elements, their properties, and the vital components of the human body, one can better appreciate the nature of Alchemy and its philosophical implications on the nature of humanity. The ancient pursuit of transforming the tres primas, both in the literal sense of turning base metals into gold, and the spiritual and personal growth of the alchemist, relied upon understanding these principles.
