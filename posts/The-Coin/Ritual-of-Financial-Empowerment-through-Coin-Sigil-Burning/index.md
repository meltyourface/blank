## Title: The Rite of Financial Serenity

Objective: The dissolution of monetary hindrances and the attraction of prosperity through the mystic principles of The Coin.

Materials Needed:
1. The Coin (a physical or talismanic representation)
2. Three green candles (symbolizing wealth and growth)
3. One white candle (representing purity and source energy)
4. Anointing oil (such as cinnamon or patchouli oil)
5. Pen and paper (to create the sigil)
6. A small dish
7. Incense or sage (for cleansing)

### I. Preparation of the Sacred Space
1. Choose a quiet, comfortable location where you won't be disturbed.
2. Thoroughly cleanse the area by smudging with incense or sage.
3. Cast a protective circle around the space, envisioning a barrier of shimmering energy that will contain and focus the energies of the ritual.
4. Place The Coin at the center of the circle.

### II. Sigil Creation
1. On a piece of paper, write down your financial goals or intentions.
2. Remove all vowels and repeated consonants from the written statement.
3. Using the remaining letters, create a unique and visually appealing design. This design is your sigil, representing your financial situation and the positive changes you seek.

### III. Invocation of Coin-related Entities
1. **Light the white candle and call upon the guardian spirits related to The Coin**: "Spirits of wealth, abundance, and prosperity, heed my call and join me in this sacred rite. I invoke your guidance and support as I release any obstacles preventing my financial flourishing."
2. Visualize these spirits congregating around The Coin, infusing it with their abundant energies.

### IV. Candle Sorcery
1. Anoint each green candle with oil, starting at the center and working your way to the top and bottom, symbolizing the drawing of wealth.
2. Place the green candles in a triangle formation with The Coin in the center.
3. Light the green candles, starting with the top candle (prosperity), followed by the bottom left (financial stability), and finally the bottom right (investment growth).

### V. Manifestation and Visualization
1. Holding your sigil, meditate on specific images and scenarios of your ideal financial status. Visualize each detail, from the balance in your bank account to the success of your investments.
2. See yourself thriving financially, giving thanks for the abundance your life grants.
3. Place the sigil in the dish at the center of the circle, on top of The Coin.
4. Focus on the energy of the entities and the burning candles, allowing it to flow into your sigil and empower your intentions.

### VI. Sigil Activation and Completion
1. Carefully burn the sigil in the flames of the green candles, visualizing your obstacles dissolving and your intentions manifesting as the paper turns to ash.
2. Collect the ashes and bury them outside, returning them to the Earth, signifying the completion of the cycle and the manifestation of your desires.
3. Thank the Coin-related entities for their assistance and release them back into the realm from which they came.
4. Extinguish the candles in reverse order (from bottom right to top) and close the protective circle, seeing the energies dissipate and integrate into the world around you.

With the completion of the Rite of Financial Serenity, you have harnessed the mystic powers of The Coin to dissolve your monetary hindrances and pave the way for financial prosperity. Stay open to the opportunities that present themselves and continue to nurture a healthy relationship with wealth and abundance.
