The First Council of Nicaea, held in 325 CE in the city of Nicaea (currently known as Iznik, Turkey), was the first ecumenical council of Christian bishops. The Council addressed various theological and ecclesiastical issues, most notably the nature of Christ and Arianism. The background, key theological debates, and lasting effects of the Council are crucial to understanding its influence on the early Christian churches.

Historical Context:
Before the First Council of Nicaea, Christianity experienced several periods of persecution under Roman rule. However, upon Emperor Constantine's rise to power and his legalization of Christianity with the Edict of Milan in 313 CE, the religion gained unprecedented influence. Constantine I, eager to bring order and unity to the vast empire, sought to address divisive theological disputes and strengthen the Church's hierarchy.

Key Theological Debates:
1. Arianism: The primary theological issue addressed by the Council was Arianism, which was named after its proponent Arius, a presbyter from Alexandria. Arius maintained that Jesus Christ, or the Son, was not eternal or divine in the same sense as God the Father but was rather a created being. This view was seen as a threat to traditional Christian beliefs in the divinity and trinity of God.
2. Theological Resolution: The Council, led by church leaders such as Alexander of Alexandria and Athanasius of Alexandria, convened to settle this theological dispute. The result was the Nicene Creed, a statement of faith that affirmed the divinity and consubstantiality of Jesus Christ with God the Father, effectively condemning Arianism as heresy.
3. Ecclesiastical Structures and Canon Law: Aside from the theological disputes, the Council tackled issues regarding the Church's organization and administration. It established guidelines for ecclesiastical ceremonies, fixing the date of Easter, and passed 20 canons (church laws) related to the conduct of bishops, clergy, and laity.

Lasting Effects and Enduring Legacy:
1. Nicene Creed: The doctrinal statement established during the First Council of Nicaea remains central to Christian faith and continues to be used in various Christian denominations as a declaration of faith. The creed has been revised in subsequent ecumenical councils, but it remains a testament to the foundational role of the Council in shaping Christian theology.
2. Reinforcement of Hierarchical Structures: The Council helped to create a more organized Church hierarchy, with a clear set of canonical laws, uniform liturgical practices, and a strengthened episcopal authority. The bishops' elevated status solidified their role in decision-making and shaping Christian doctrine.
3. Influence on Future Councils: The Council's success in addressing theological disputes and consolidating ecclesiastical power set a precedent for subsequent councils. The ecumenical (universal) nature of the Council became a model for future gatherings to resolve theological and ecclesiastical disputes, such as the Council of Ephesus (431 CE) and the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE).
4. Constantineâ€™s role in Christianity: Emperor Constantine's convening of the Council marked a turning point in the relationship between Church and state, with the emperor taking an active role in influencing religion. This event laid the foundation for the fusion of church and state in the later Roman Empire and Byzantium.

In conclusion, the First Council of Nicaea left an indelible mark on the early Church, shaping its theology, ecclesiastical structures, and relationship with the Roman state. The Nicene Creed, the condemnation of Arianism, and the strengthening of the episcopal hierarchy continue to have lasting effects on Christianity. By understanding the intricacies and outcomes of the Council, we gain valuable insights into the development of early Christian churches.
