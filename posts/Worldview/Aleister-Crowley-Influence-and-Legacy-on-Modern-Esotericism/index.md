For this task, we will investigate the impact of Aleister Crowley, an influential occult practitioner within the Worldview context, on the evolution and expansion of his esoteric tradition, Thelema. We will explore his philosophical beliefs, mystical experiences, and unique methodologies, providing concrete examples, and analyze the correlations between his contributions and the tradition's progression. Additionally, we will assess any potential lasting effects on contemporary occult practices and Crowley's global influence within the Worldview landscape.

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was an English occultist, ceremonial magician, and writer who founded the religion and philosophy of Thelema. He was a prolific and controversial figure in the occult world. Crowley believed himself to be the prophet for the new Aeon of Horus, ushering in a new era of spiritual understanding and freedom, based on the central tenet: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

Philosophical Beliefs: Crowley's beliefs were rooted in a rejection of the repressive Victorian moral code and an embrace of personal liberty and self-expression. Thelema postulated that each individual has their own "True Will," a unique and divine purpose in life. The goal of Thelemic practices was to discover and align oneself with this Will, transcending societal influences and achieving spiritual fulfillment.

The Thelemic pantheon incorporated various deities and mythological figures, drawing from Egyptian, Gnostic, and Eastern mysticism; it also included new beings such as Aiwass, who Crowley claimed to have encountered in Cairo during a mystical experience. Central themes of Thelema included the union of opposites, exemplified in the sacred marriage of Nuit (Infinity) and Hadit (Point), and the transformative power of love, embodied in the concept of Babalon.

Mystical Experiences: Crowley's formative mystical experiences include his visions and claims of contact with supernatural entities during the Cairo Working in 1904, where he received "The Book of the Law," a foundational text for Thelema. Throughout his life, he engaged in magical rituals and astral travels, claiming encounters with occult forces.

Unique Methodologies: Crowley's esoteric methodologies were vast and drawn from various sources, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Eastern philosophies, and yogic practices. Crowley developed the system of Magick, which emphasized the role of symbols and rituals in harnessing and directing personal will, to enact change in the practitioner's life and external events. He also formulated the Gnostic Mass, an expansive ritual that celebrated the marriage of opposites and the realization of True Will.

Correlations and Progressions: Crowley's contributions had a significant impact on the expansion of Thelema. His prolific writing, provocative persona, and innovative methodologies gained him followers and notoriety. His works translated complex mystical teachings into accessible, modern language, which in turn attracted new generations of occult seekers who may not have been inclined towards traditional esoteric systems.

Lasting Effects on Contemporary Occult Practices: Crowley's ideological and methodological influence on contemporary occult practices is evident in the development of modern magical organizations, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), the Argenteum Astrum (A∴A∴), and The Church of Satan. The concept of personal freedom and self-discovery has permeated many spiritual and countercultural movements of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Global Influence in the Worldview Landscape: The impact of Crowley on the Worldview landscape has been broad and far-reaching. His teachings have inspired artists, musicians, and writers for generations, influencing figures such as Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs, and Jimmy Page. Though controversial, his ideas on personal liberty and the primacy of the individual have left a lasting impression on the collective cultural consciousness.

In conclusion, Aleister Crowley's contributions to the evolution and expansion of Thelema within the Worldview context were manifold. Through his writing, mystical experiences, and the development of unique methodologies, he has left an indelible mark on esoteric traditions and contemporary occult practices worldwide. His influence extends beyond the realm of the occult, shaping the artistic and philosophical landscape of the modern era.
