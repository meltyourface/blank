## I. Creation of Thoughtforms and Servitors

1. **Preparation**:
   a. Set up a sacred space using a circle of chalk or salt, large enough for you to work comfortably within.
   b. Place four candles at each cardinal point (North, East, South, and West) representing the four elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water)
   c. Place a crystal in the center of the circle to anchor Spirit energy
   d. **Prepare the essential tools**: a wand, a pentacle, a chalice, an athame, and a bolline
   e. Dress in clean and comfortable ritual attire

2. **Invocation**:
   a. Light the candles clockwise, starting with North and say: "I invoke the power of Earth/"
   b. **Move onto the East and say**: "I invoke the power of Air/"
   c. **Proceed to South and say**: "I invoke the power of Fire/"
   d. **Go to West and say**: "I invoke the power of Water/ Let the elements be my witness and protectors."
   e. Stand in the center of the circle, raise your arms and say: "I invoke the power of Spirit to guide my creativity as I fashion this thoughtform or servitor in accordance with my will."

3. **Crafting Your Thoughtform or Servitor**:
   a. Contemplate the specific goal or task you wish the thoughtform or servitor to accomplish.
   b. Determine the most appropriate form for your thoughtform or servitor.
   c. Name your thoughtform or servitor - it should be unique and meaningful for the task it's going to fulfill.
   d. Using the bolline, draw its Sigil in the air, visualizing it taking form.

4. **Charging Your Thoughtform or Servitor**:
   a. **Chant the following mantra to awaken its energy**: "Kae'asekk atha'torrak, neren'fu rak'tsaat uul'valth."
   b. Visualize white energy from the Spirit crystal infusing the Sigil and giving life to your thoughtform or servitor.
   c. Direct your own energy through your wand, pointing at the Sigil and empowering it, saying: "By the power I hold within my hands, and the realms above and below, I command you (Name), awaken and serve my desire."
   d. Command the servitor or thoughtform with clear instructions about its purpose, tasks, and duration of existence.

### II. Maintenance of Thoughtforms and Servitors

1. **Charging**:
   a. Perform daily or weekly meditations to reinforce the energy of your thoughtform or servitor, depending on the complexity of the task.
   b. Offerings of incense, food, or crystals can also be used to keep their energy strong.

2. **Supervision**:
   a. Check in on your thoughtform or servitor regularly by entering a meditative or trance state.
   b. Observe its progress with the tasks and make necessary corrections if needed.

3. **Boundaries**:
   a. Maintain a healthy relationship with the thoughtform or servitor by setting strict boundaries on its activities.
   b. Ensure its energy does not become attached or interfere with anything outside of its domain or purpose.

### III. Dissolution of Thoughtforms and Servitors

1. Recall the Thoughtform or Servitor and Thank It for Its Service
2. **Perform the following chant**: "Kre't'nashae rik'kaal fenathare, thrak'k'taara t'yentha za'halam."
3. Visualize white energy from the Spirit crystal unbinding the energy of the thoughtform or servitor, and absorb it back into the crystal.
4. Dismantle the sacred space by extinguishing the candles and clearing the circle.

Protection Mechanism:
An obsidian or black tourmaline crystal should be placed at the center of the circle alongside the Spirit crystal for grounding and protection. The practitioner will also incorporate the chant, “Anar’vael’dra’ma saerkiti za’fosh,” to invoke the power of protection and ward against malevolent forces.

Real-World Example:
A thoughtform or servitor designed to assist the practitioner in enhancing their mastery and understanding of the esoteric and occult could be created. The servitor would be given the form of the mythical owl, symbolizing wisdom and knowledge, and would be named "Visarenyx". Its primary task would be to aid the practitioner in studying, comprehending, and applying esoteric and occult teachings, helping the practitioner decipher complex texts and accessing deeper insights within the realm of the Spirit world.
