The ramifications of inappropriately harnessing the mystical energies of an ancient necromantic ritual are varied and far-reaching, with consequences that reverberate across personal, societal, and cosmic levels. The misuse of such arcane knowledge, either inadvertently or intentionally, disrupts the equilibrium between life and death, causing profound disturbances in the high fantasy world's metaphysical, interpersonal, and ontological structures. 

At the personal level, the practitioner responsible for misusing the necromantic ritual may experience a host of internal torments, as their soul is gradually tainted or shredded by the unsanctioned manipulation of dark forces. For example, the protagonist, a once kind-hearted sorcerer named Allamar, unearths a forbidden tome of necromancy and, in a moment of desperation, attempts to resurrect a fallen comrade. His recklessness warps his essence, however, and he gradually succumbs to malevolence and madness as the necrotic energy corrupts his being. Consequently, Allamar's relationships suffer, and he is forced to confront the torment of losing those he once cherished.

On a societal level, the misuse of necromantic rituals threatens the very fabric of civilizations as the border between the realms of life and the afterlife blur. Undead abominations both sentient and mindless may invade the world as the malignant, chaotic energies flood the land. Villages and cities fall prey to the afflicted curse, as the land becomes haunted by innumerable ghosts, wraiths, and skeletal warriors, sowing fear and despair among the populace. Trust in the ruling magical and religious institutions may erode as they struggle to contain the escalating doom their lack of oversight has allowed.

Cosmically, the destabilization resulting from the abuse of necromantic energies might compromise the universal structure of the high fantasy realm. As the barrier separating life and death weakens further, malevolent spirits and transdimensional entities break into the world, drastically altering the natural order. The deities responsible for maintaining the cosmic balance may take umbrage at this affront, exacting divine retribution on the land or initiating celestial conflicts, as deities aligned with life confront those who rule over death and decay, ushering a cataclysmic battle as the high fantasy world hangs in the balance.

To mitigate these harrowing consequences, characters may embark on perilous quests to restore harmony to their world. One possible method would be the pursuit of a rare artifact imbued with the power to reverse the ramifications of the ancient necromantic ritual, necessitating the assembly of a party comprising brave warriors, scholars, and spellcasters. Alternatively, forming an alliance with celestial beings or well-versed necromancers could provide the knowledge or divine intervention required to expunge the dark energies and repair the breached realms.

In conclusion, the ramifications of inappropriately harnessing the mystical energies of an ancient necromantic ritual extend across personal, societal, and cosmic dimensions within a high fantasy setting. Through intricate storytelling and meticulous world-building, a tale can unfold that showcases the devastating consequences of meddling with forces beyond mortal comprehension, while simultaneously offering characters a chance for redemption and the restoration of equilibrium, as they embark on their perilous adventures.
