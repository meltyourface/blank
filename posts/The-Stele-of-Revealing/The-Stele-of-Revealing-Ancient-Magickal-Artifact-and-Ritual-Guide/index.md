## The Stele of Revealing: Unlocking the Secrets of Ancient Magicks

**The Historical Context of the Stele of Revealing**

To fully understand the significance and power associated with the Stele of Revealing, it is important to delve into its historical context. Discovered in the 19th century, this ancient artifact is believed to date back to around 680 BCE and was found in Egypt, in the city of Thebes. The stele is made of limestone, measuring approximately 51 centimeters in height and 31 centimeters in width.

It is reputed to have been found at the site of the funerary temple of Ankh-af-na-khonsu, an ancient Egyptian priest who was a devotee of the god Mentu, a form of the falcon-headed god Horus. The Stele of Revealing is intricately inscribed with invocations and hymns to the deities Ra-Horakhty and Mentu. It is also adorned with carefully etched Egyptian hieroglyphics and religious imagery, providing members of the priestly class with protective blessings and guidance in both this world and the afterlife.

**Symbolic Meaning and Occult Significance**

The Stele of Revealing holds a wealth of symbolic meaning in its ornate carvings and inscriptions. At its top, we find the sun disk between the two falcon-headed gods Ra-Horakhty and Mentu, symbolizing the harmony between the forces of Ra, the ancient Egyptian sun god, and the warlike aspects of Horus embodied in Mentu. Beneath this celestial triumvirate, Ankh-af-na-khonsu can be seen adoring the divine beings, demonstrating his devotion and fealty to the gods.

The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stele invoke the protection and guidance of the gods. The front side features an offering formula addressed to Ra-Horakhty, while the back side includes a hymn to Mentu. The inscription also contains multiple instances of the ankh symbol, representing the concept of eternal life.

From an occult perspective, the Stele of Revealing attained a unique significance after it came into the possession of Aleister Crowley, a renowned English occultist and mystic. This artifact played a pivotal role in the reception of "The Book of the Law," a sacred text which formed the foundation for Thelema, the philosophical and magickal tradition developed by Crowley.

Crowley claimed that in 1904, while studying the Stele in the Cairo Museum, he received divine communications from a supernatural entity known as Aiwass. As a result, the Stele of Revealing is considered a crucial talisman within Thelemic practice, symbolizing the manifestation of ancient wisdom and divine guidance in the modern world.

**Practical Applications and Rituals**

For the aspiring magician or occultist, the Stele of Revealing is a profound source of inspiration and potential. Through the process of meditating upon, or otherwise working with, the Stele's symbolism and the deities it represents, one may begin to uncover hidden aspects of oneself, enabling spiritual awakening and empowerment.

First, familiarize yourself with the symbols and deities found on the Stele. Spend time meditating on their meanings and associations, allowing your mind to open to their guidance and energy. You may find it helpful to create a sacred space in which to conduct these meditations, incorporating candles, incense, and other symbolic items related to the Stele and its deities.

A ritual designed to invoke the power of the Stele could involve the following steps:

1. Begin by purifying your ritual space with smudging or other traditional methods to create a protective boundary.

2. Invoke the presence of Ankh-af-na-khonsu, Ra-Horakhty, and Mentu through either vocalized chants or silent contemplation.

3. Hold a mental image of the Stele in your mind, or keep a physical representation in front of you. Visualize the energy of the deities invoked flowing through the Stele, empowering you and unlocking hidden wisdom.

4. Spend time in quiet meditation, absorbing the energies and awaiting any insights or revelations that may come to you.

5. Once you feel the ritual is complete, thank the deities for their presence and close the ritual space, affirming that their energy and protection remain with you.

By engaging with the Stele of Revealing through such practices, you gain not only a deeper understanding of this powerful artifact, but also access to an ancient source of guidance in your own spiritual journey. May the blessings of Ankh-af-na-khonsu, Ra-Horakhty, and Mentu be upon you as you unlock the mysteries of this sacred talisman.
