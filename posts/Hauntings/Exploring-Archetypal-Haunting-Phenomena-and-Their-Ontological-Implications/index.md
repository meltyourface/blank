To examine the etymologies of five widely-known haunting phenomena from diverse cultures, we will delve into the linguistic origins, cultural histories, and interconnected themes that constitute these phenomena. We will also illustrate how archetypal manifestations within human consciousness are relevant to the broader ontology of the soul, reality, and consciousness.

1. Poltergeist (German origin)
Etymology: The term "poltergeist" comes from the German language, combining "poltern" (to make noise or rumble) and "geist" (spirit). 
Archetypal Manifestation: The poltergeist archetype represents a mischievous spirit causing disturbances in a living space, often acting out to seek attention or communicate unresolved anguish. This energy may be linked to psychokinetic phenomena, and possibly reflect deeper aspects of human consciousness such as suppressed emotions or unaddressed traumas.
Ontological Significance: Poltergeist phenomena force us to confront the possibility that our emotions and consciousness shape the reality we perceive, including the appearance of seemingly paranormal entities.

2. Banshee (Irish origin)
Etymology: The term "banshee" derives from the Old Irish "ben síde" or "bean sídhe" meaning "woman of the fairy mound" or "female supernatural being."
Archetypal Manifestation: Banshees are female spirits in Irish mythology, usually portrayed as heralds of death, whose wailing or keening foretells the death of a family member. They encompass themes of grief, mourning, and the supernatural connection between life and death.
Ontological Significance: The banshee embodies the human desire for control in the face of mortality and underscores the inherent connection between the living and the spiritual realms.

3. Doppelganger (German origin)
Etymology: "Doppelganger" is another German term, originating from "doppel" (double) and "gänger" (goer). 
Archetypal Manifestation: A doppelganger is an eerie, often malevolent, exact double or apparition of an individual. It represents the notion of "the other," and may symbolize our darker or nascent aspects, desired or unexpressed aspects of ourselves, or even our confrontation with mortality.
Ontological Significance: Doppelgangers challenge the concepts of identity and the nature of consciousness, posing questions about the uniqueness of the soul and the possible existence of parallel realities.

4. Jinn (Islamic culture)
Etymology: The word "jinn" (also spelled "djinn" or "genie") stems from the Arabic term "jann," meaning "to hide" or "to be hidden."
Archetypal Manifestation: In Islamic belief, jinn are supernatural beings created by Allah from smokeless fire, made to live alongside humans and other creations. They possess free will and can be benevolent, neutral or evil entities who interfere with human lives.
Ontological Significance: The existence of jinn provokes questions about the construction of reality, the relationship between humanity and the spiritual world, and the influence of unseen entities on our existence.

5. Yūrei (Japanese origin)
Etymology: "Yūrei" is a Japanese term, comprising "yū" (vague or faint) and "rei" (spirit or soul).
Archetypal Manifestation: In Japanese folklore, yūrei are the spirits of deceased individuals unable to pass on to the afterlife due to unresolved emotions such as revenge, love, or sorrow. They are traditionally depicted as pale, floating women with long, unkempt hair.
Ontological Significance: Yūrei emphasize the importance of emotional resolution for the soul's journey and the potential consequences of unaddressed emotional burdens on the human psyche and consciousness.

In summary, the central themes shared among these various haunting phenomena include the human confrontation with mortality, the spiritual connection between life and death, the emotional impact of unresolved experiences, and the influence of unseen forces on the nature of reality and human consciousness. The etymologies and manifested archetypes of these phenomena illustrate a collective desire to understand the interconnectedness of soul, reality, and consciousness, ultimately reflecting broad ontological questions about humanity and the universe.
