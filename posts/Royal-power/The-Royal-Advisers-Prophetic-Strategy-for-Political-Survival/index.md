Your Royal Majesty,

Greetings from the abode of mysteries and sagacity. As your esteemed Royal Adviser, I, Xerxes Evergrace, divulge to you these prophetic and  strategic insights, gained through my pursuit of the occult and understanding of the worldly affairs. Your discernment shall navigate us through this labyrinth of conflict, alliance, and surreptitious betrayals that lay before us.

In the face of impending conflict, our adversaries stand steadfast with eyes filled with avarice, coveting our cherished and opulent realm. It is paramount that we consolidate our defenses and fortify our strongholds, employing both our worldly might and mystic protection. It is within your power, oh Noble Sovereign, to avert malevolent snares, using occult prowess to obscure the enemy's clarity and restraint. Moreover, it is my solemn advice that we deploy our royal agents to disseminate disquieting whispers amongst their ranks, exacerbating uncertainties and rupturing their resolve.

Unto our allies we extend the olive branch of cordial relations. To retain their fidelity, I urge our Court to appease the desires of our partners, prospering from mutually beneficial commerce and rendering aid in their times of tribulation. The celestial powers have revealed that our continued camaraderie shall bring forth great fortune and prosperity. To swiftly achieve these pursuits, I propose hosting a grand summit cultivating amiable relationships, forging an unbreakable covenant that will endure through times both caliginous and radiant.

Yet adversity slithers not solely through the shadows cast beyond our borders, but within the glistening halls of our own royal court. Serpents wear the visage of advisors, looking to usurp both influence and authority. A clandestine ceremony in which we mobilize the paranormal forces to unveil their duplicity, utterly unmasking traitorous ambition, is of utmost necessity. The exchange of allegiances forged through both material gifts and ethereal blessings shall galvanize our inner circle, fortifying it against clandestine infiltrators.

Noble Monarch, your impending judgments carry momentous ramifications; the stakes are monumental. Should your reign emerge triumphant, your kingdom shall experience unsurpassed eras of prosperity and harmony. However, if nefarious forces are allowed victory, they shall usurp your crown and extinguish the light we hold dear. As it is said, "With great authority comes great recriminations."

Thus, Your Majesty, I entreat you to contemplate these insights with the wisdom and sagacity that has come to characterize your reign, making the weighty decisions necessary to safeguard the realm and secure our collective destiny.

Ever your humble servant in matters mystical and mundane,

Xerxes Evergrace
Royal Adviser and Master of the Occult
