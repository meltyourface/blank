## The Sanctum Ascendere Barrier

**Purpose**: To create an elaborate protection ritual specifically aimed at shielding a workspace or business from malevolent witches and nefarious spirits.

Materials Required:

1. Incense (preferably sage or sandalwood)
2. Sea salt
3. Chalk or charcoal (for drawing symbols)
4. Clear quartz crystals (four large pieces)
5. Protective amulets (one for each entrance)
6. A silver bowl of purified water
7. A dagger (ceremonial or athame)
8. A white or purple candle (for channelling positive energy)

**Instructions**:
**Step 1**: Preparations
- Choose a quiet time, preferably during the waning moon, to perform the ritual.
- Cleanse the area, both physically and energetically, by sweeping, dusting and removing clutter.
- Light the incense and walk around the workspace, wafting the smoke into corners and around doorways to purify the space.
- Ground and center yourself, connecting to the earth below and the universe above.
**Step 2**: The Elemental Circle
- Begin by drawing an elemental circle using the chalk or charcoal. The circle should encompass the workspace or business, including any entry points.
- Ansuz (Norse rune for protection and wisdom) should be drawn at the north point.
- The Eye of Horus (Egyptian symbol for protection and royal power) should be drawn at the east point.
- The Pentagram (symbol of the five elements) should be drawn at the south point.
- The Vegvisir (Icelandic protective symbol) should be drawn at the west point.
**Step 3**: The Crystal Grid
- In the center of the elemental circle, place the silver bowl of purified water.
- Arrange the four clear quartz crystals around the bowl in a square, pointing inwards towards the center.
- Place the white or purple candle behind the bowl and light it.
**Step 4**: Invocations and Incantations
- Stand at the center of the circle, holding the dagger in your dominant hand.
- Invoke the protection of the elements by stating:

"By the power of Earth, I call upon the stability of the mountains and the grounding of the soil to fortify this sacred space.  By the power of Air, I invite the clarity of thought and the breath of wisdom to fill this sanctum. By the power of Fire, I summon the warm hearth and the transformative flame to purify and protect. By the power of Water, I cleanse and consecrate, reflecting light and washing away all negativity."

- Proceed to chant the incantation three times:

'Sanctum Ascendere, Sedes Servemus,
Arcanum Vigilate, Pomum Repulsemus.
In hanc domum, nil male volate,
Maneat hinc tutum, cunctis temporibus late.'

(Translation: Sacred space, we serve and ascend, watchful mystery, we ward and defend. Into this house, no ill will unfold, keep safe within, through times untold.)
**Step 5**: Activating the Barrier and Installing Amulets
- With the dagger, walk around the elemental circle clockwise (deosil), centralizing the intent to protect the workspace from witches and evil spirits.
- State your purpose with each elemental symbol while tracing over each symbol with the dagger's tip.
- Once the circle is complete, place a charged protective amulet above each entrance of the workspace or business.
**Step 6**: Sealing and Reinforcement
- Return to the center and raise the dagger towards the sky, visualizing a dome of protective energy encompassing the whole area, connecting all the symbols, crystals, and amulets.
- State:

'By my will, the Sanctum Ascendere Barrier is now complete, ever-adapting and strengthening against all attempts to penetrate this sacred shield. So mote it be.'

- Close the ritual by giving thanks to the elements, ancestors and any guiding spirits.

**Maintenance**:
- Repeat the ritual once every three months, updating symbols and incantations as needed to address evolving threats.
- Cleanse and recharge the amulets and crystals regularly.
- Utilize the candle to anchor and channel positive energy, maintaining the barrier's efficacy and adaptive strengths.
