description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Protection from witches and evil spirits, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Develop a comprehensive detection system specifically designed to reveal the presence of witchcraft, malevolent forces, and evil spirits within a location. Incorporate a combination of traditional divination tools, sacred geometry, and modern technology to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the system. Additionally, devise a method to rank the severity of the detected supernatural threats, allowing for prioritization and targeted countermeasures to be employed in the protection of affected individuals and locations from these dark forces.

To develop a comprehensive detection system to reveal the presence of witchcraft, malevolent forces, and evil spirits within a location, we will incorporate a combination of traditional divination tools, sacred geometry, and modern technology. This system will be called the Advanced Supernatural Threat Identification System (ASTIS).

### I. Traditional Divination Tools:
1. Pendulum: A pendulum made with a crystal or metal known for its energy detection properties (such as black tourmaline, amethyst, or obsidian) will be used to detect spiritual energy within a space.
2. Dowsing Rods: These rods will be made of copper and can be used to locate areas with significant energy concentration.
3. Runes: A set of 24 runes will be used for divinatory purposes, with additional attention paid to those runes specifically related to the presence of witchcraft, evil spirits, and malevolent forces (such as Hagalaz, Thurisaz, and Nauthiz).

### II. Sacred Geometry:
1. Ley Line Mapping: Using knowledge of local ley lines (invisible energy channels found across the Earth), we will determine if any significant energy channels intersect within the location, as these intersections may indicate a hotspot for supernatural activity.
2. Geomantic Sigils: Various protective sigils will be drawn on the walls, doorways, and windows of the location to ward off negative energy and spirits.
3. Crystal Grids: Arranging specific crystals (quartz, black tourmaline, and selenite) in sacred geometry patterns throughout the location to amplify their energy-cleansing properties.

### III. Modern Technology:
1. Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Detector: This device will be used to measure electromagnetic energy levels within a location, as elevated EMF levels may indicate spiritual or supernatural activity.
2. Infrared Cameras: These cameras will be placed strategically in areas where significant supernatural activity is detected, in order to capture any visual manifestations of malevolent forces, witchcraft, or evil spirits.
3. Advanced Sound Recorders: High-quality sound recording devices will be set up to capture any unusual or unidentifiable sounds that may be associated with supernatural threats.

### IV. Threat Ranking Methodology:
The following ranking system will be utilized to prioritize and facilitate targeted countermeasures against the detected supernatural threats:
1. Level 1: Mild supernatural interference. Can be addressed with simple cleansing rituals and protective measures.
2. Level 2: Moderate supernatural presence: May necessitate more involved rituals and team intervention.
3. Level 3: Severe supernatural threats: May require extensive purification processes and professional assistance from experts in the field.
4. Level 4: Extremely severe supernatural threats: May pose an imminent danger to individuals and property. Immediate action and expert intervention are necessary to mitigate the risks.

Implementing the above-mentioned techniques and technologies will allow for the accurate and effective detection of witchcraft, malevolent forces, and evil spirits within a location, ultimately protecting affected individuals and locations from these dark forces.
