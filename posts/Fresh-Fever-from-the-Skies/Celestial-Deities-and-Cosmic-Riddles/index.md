In the vast celestial canvas, the obsidian sea unfurls,
Where lies the fabled realm, the Fresh Fever from the Skies,
Ascend the seeker's gaze, toward the cosmic whirls,
A pantheon divine, where enigmatic deities arise.

I.
Skyborne Mystics, aloof, in cryptic gyres dance,
Their whispers in the wind, resounding prophecies uncaught,
Eternal waltz of shades, the lofty souls entrance,
Arcane secrets veiled, the twilight climes are fraught.

II.
Between the realms, so fevered, of blinding light and darkest night,
Lost Luna's boundless grace, and Solar splendor intertwined,
For eons venerated, wanderers in celestial flight,
Pyrrhic paths resplendent, warped and weft in secret signs.

III.
Beneath the astral dome, the astral tapestry doth weave,
Of cryptic nodes and stars, the deities reside,
The gnosis seekers crave, the chosen few receive,
The blessed knowledge flows, within their hearts to bide.

IV.
Enigma's temple hewn, a monument of ages past,
The brazier's tongues of fire, divine and mortal laws perplex,
A sacrificial rite, an offering, an eternal fast,
Unbind the paradox, where fickle gods their whims impress.

V.
The cosmic tendrils twist, connections of divine reprise,
Immutable yet thralls, to forces e'er obscure,
Confluence of wills, their edicts carved 'cross the skies,
The truth but lies within, its beauty thus procure.

VI.
Foretold, in ancient whispers, unfathomable destinies,
Giants draped in nebulae, of stardust and of time,
Their allegory etched, in script of cosmic frequencies,
All paths in unison, to the cosmic rhythm climb.

In reverence, O seeker, on thy hallowed throne reside,
The deities enigmatic, their secrets speculate,
The Fresh Fever from the Skies, in endless mysteries hide,
Yet, reach within the veil, and touch the hand of fate.
