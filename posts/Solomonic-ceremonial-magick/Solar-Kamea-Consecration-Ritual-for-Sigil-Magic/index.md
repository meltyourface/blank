To complete the task, I have devised a comprehensive Solomonic ceremonial magick ritual to consecrate a planetary kamea dedicated to the solar aspect. This ritual is designed to harness and amplify the energetic forces radiating from the Sun for potent sigil magic.

Materials required for the ritual:

1. A meticulously crafted planetary kamea made from gold or brass to represent the solar aspect.
2. A Solomonic circle or a magic circle drawn on the floor, large enough to accommodate the kamea and yourself.
3. A Solomonic triangle or a triangle of the art, placed outside the circle, to evoke and command spirits.
4. A consecrated solar athame or a ritual knife.
5. A Solomonic pentacle or talisman with the drawn sigil of the Sun.
6. Frankincense and myrrh incense.
7. A yellow or gold altar cloth.
8. A golden chalice or cup filled with sun-charged water.
9. A white or gold candle to represent the sun's light.
10. A physical or digital copy of an authoritative grimoire such as "The Lesser Key of Solomon" (Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis) or "The Greater Key of Solomon."

**Calculations**:

1. ****Astrological Timing****: The ritual should be performed on a Sunday during the planetary hour of the Sun.
2. ****Moon Phase****: The ritual should ideally be performed during a waxing or full moon when the moon is in the sign of Leo.
3. ****Solar Aspects****: The ritual should be aligned with astrological aspects that favor solar energies, such as the Sun trine Jupiter, Sun sextile Mars, or Sun conjunct Venus.

Consecration process:

1. Begin by thoroughly cleansing and consecrating your ritual space.
2. Set up the Solomonic circle and triangle of the art on the floor.
3. Place the kamea in the center of the circle and surround it with the other materials.
4. Light the white or gold candle and incense.
5. Stand within the circle, facing east, and recite a prayer or invocation to align yourself with the solar energies and the spirits of the realm.
6. Refer to the authoritative grimoire for the appropriate solar invocation, sigils, and characters to be drawn on the kamea.
7. Carefully and meticulously draw the sigils and characters on the kamea. As you draw, focus your intent on empowering the kamea with solar energy.
8. Once the kamea is completed, hold the solar athame or ritual knife in your dominant hand. Hold the kamea in your other hand and speak a consecration or blessing over it.
9. Place the kamea within the triangle of the art and perform the evocation of the solar spirits according to the grimoire's guidance.
10. Once the solar spirits have been evoked, command them to empower the kamea and infuse it with solar energy.
11. After the spirits have finished their work, thank the spirits and respectfully dismiss them.
12. Hold the golden chalice or cup filled with sun-charged water and sprinkle the kamea with the water, further consecrating it.
13. Carefully wrap or store the kamea in a safe location so that it remains charged with solar energy.

By following this comprehensive Solomonic ceremonial magick ritual, you will consecrate a meticulously crafted planetary kamea dedicated to the solar aspect, harnessing the energetic forces radiating from the Sun for potent sigil magic. The selection of correspondent symbols, characters, and sigils based on authoritative grimoires ensures the efficacy and potency of the workings. Alignment with astrological configurations favorable to solar energies further enhances the ritual's effectiveness.
