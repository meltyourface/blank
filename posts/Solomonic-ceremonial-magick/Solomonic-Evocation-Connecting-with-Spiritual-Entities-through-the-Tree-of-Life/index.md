To answer this knowledge challenge, let's first define the key terminologies and concepts to establish an understanding of the framework within which Solomonic ceremonial magick operates.

Solomonic ceremonial magick is a tradition of Western occultism that focuses on rituals and practices derived from the writings attributed to King Solomon, who, according to legend, possessed profound wisdom and was given the ability to control spirits and demons. Evocation is the act of summoning and communicating with spiritual entities, such as angels, archangels, and demons, by following specific rituals and procedures.

The Tree of Life is a mystical concept that represents the structure and interconnectedness of the universe. It is comprised of ten spheres, or sefirot, which are interconnected by 22 paths. The sefirot represent various divine attributes, and each sefira corresponds to a different aspect of God's creation.

The celestial hierarchy is a system of classification for various spiritual beings based on their position in the cosmos and their function in the divine order. Angels, archangels, and choirs are examples of such beings, with each category having its own distinct roles and responsibilities.

Now that we have a foundational understanding of the concepts involved, let's dive into how evocation in Solomonic ceremonial magick utilizes these elements.

1. **Identification of Intent**: The practitioner defines their intention or desired outcome, which can include seeking knowledge, protection, guidance, or power. This intention plays a crucial role in selecting the appropriate spiritual entity to evoke.

2. **Locating the Corresponding Sefira**: Each sefira in the Tree of Life corresponds to different divine qualities, and hence each has specific spiritual entities associated with it. The practitioner identifies the sefira that aligns with their intention, helping to determine the entity suited to their purpose.

3. **Selection of Spiritual Entity**: Once the sefira is identified, the practitioner can select an appropriate spiritual entity from the celestial hierarchy. For example, if the intention is to seek wisdom, the practitioner might select an archangel associated with the sefira of Chokhmah (Wisdom).

4. **Preparations and Ritual Space**: Before performing the evocation ritual, the practitioner must create a sacred space, often through consecration and the use of ritual tools like the magical circle and the triangle of manifestation. They may also incorporate symbols, sigils, and correspondences relevant to the sefira and spiritual entity they're evoking.

5. **Recitation of Invocations and Prayers**: During the ritual, the practitioner recites specific invocations and prayers to request the assistance of the chosen spiritual entity. These prayers often include the names of other spiritual entities associated with the entity's celestial hierarchy, reinforcing the connections between the sefirot and the practitioner's intention.

6. **Communication and Manifestation**: If the evocation is successful, the practitioner will now be able to communicate with the summoned entity, seeking its wisdom, guidance, or assistance in achieving their intended outcome. The spiritual entity may manifest in various forms, such as through visualizations, auditory experiences, or through divinatory practices.

In conclusion, the process of evocation in Solomonic ceremonial magick is a synergistic interplay between the practitioner's intent, the correspondences of the sefirot in the Tree of Life, and the celestial hierarchy. By understanding the relationships between these concepts and following the prescribed rituals, practitioners can summon and communicate with spiritual entities in pursuit of their desired outcomes.
