To comprehensively answer this knowledge challenge, it is essential first to provide an overview of each component: the Hermetic principles, Kabbalah's Tree of Life, and the Tarot's Major Arcana, before delving into their significant correlations and the synthesis' impact on one's spiritual journey.

The Hermetic Principles are foundational teachings of Hermeticism, an esoteric philosophical and religious tradition stemming from the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. These principles are documented in the text known as "The Kybalion" and include seven fundamental ideas:

1. The Principle of Mentalism: The idea that all existence is a manifestation of the mind and that "All is Mind."
2. The Principle of Correspondence: "As above, so below; as below, so above," meaning that the microcosm reflects the macrocosm and vice versa.
3. The Principle of Vibration: Everything in existence is in constant motion and vibrates at varying frequencies.
4. The Principle of Polarity: All things have opposites, but are two poles of the same reality.
5. The Principle of Rhythm: All phenomena have a cyclic nature and flow between opposites.
6. The Principle of Cause and Effect: Nothing happens by chance; every action has a corresponding reaction.
7. The Principle of Gender: All things contain masculine and feminine principles within them.

The Kabbalah's Tree of Life is a diagrammatic representation of the ten Sephirot, representing the various emanations and attributes of the divine. Each Sephira corresponds to a specific quality, and they are structured in a grid interconnected by paths. The Tree of Life aims to be a roadmap to understanding the relationship between the divine and the physical realm in our spiritual journey.

The Tarot's Major Arcana consists of 22 cards often described as the "Fool's Journey." These cards depict significant life events and spiritual lessons ranging from the physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects of human experience. Each card represents a unique facet of the human experience, and their sequential arrangement reveals a broader narrative of growth and transformation.

Now, addressing the significant correlations between these three systems: one crucial connection is that each element represents a different aspect of an overarching spiritual journey, all aiming to achieve a more profound understanding of self and the universe. In particular, the Hermetic Principle of Correspondence can be directly connected to the structure of the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, with the macrocosm-microcosm concept resonating through the Sephirot. 

Additionally, the Major Arcana of the Tarot bears symbolic connections to the Tree of Life and the Hermetic principles. Each Major Arcana card can be assigned to one of the 22 paths connecting the Sephirot. By understanding these associations, practitioners can gain insights into their personal spiritual journey and apply the wisdom from these systems to their lives. For example, connecting Tarot cards to the Hermetic principles may help one understand the broader context of their life experiences and how they align with universal spiritual teachings.

In synthesizing and studying these three systems, practitioners develop a deeper understanding of their interconnectedness and their mutual influence. By recognizing the correlations and exploring each system's complexities, one can gain profound insights into one's spiritual journey. The synthesis not only enhances knowledge but also presents possibilities for personal growth by combining cognitive understanding with intuitive and experiential wisdom.

In conclusion, the Hermetic principles, the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, and the Tarot's Major Arcana each provide essential elements for spiritual understanding. The synthesis of these three systems enables practitioners to gain deep insights into the interconnectedness and influence of each component in their spiritual journey. Furthermore, reflecting on these systems' significant correlations can reveal a more profound understanding of universal spiritual themes and inspire personal growth in the pursuit of one's spiritual journey.
