One of the most infamous woodcuts illustrating witchcraft and its corresponding witch trial methods is the "Witch Swimming" engraving from the 17th-century manual "Malleus Maleficarum." This engraving powerfully captures the essence of the witch trials, particularly in Europe, and conveys key elements of the methods employed to identify and prosecute witches.

The artwork portrays a public scene in which an accused witch is being subjected to the swimming test, wherein the woman has been tied to a wooden chair and is lowered into a river. The purpose of this test was to determine whether the accused would float or sink â€“ with the prevailing belief being that witches, having renounced their baptism, would be rejected by the water and therefore float. If the woman sank, she would be considered innocent but risked drowning. 

In the background, the engraving shows several spectators and witch hunters, symbolizing the widespread public hysteria and fear that encompassed the era. A large bonfire is depicted just behind the crowd, foreshadowing the common punishment of executing witches by burning them at the stake. The presence of a demon or devil figure observing the scene from above is indicative of the belief that witches were often in league with dark supernatural forces. The demon's massive wings hint at the idea of flying or nocturnal journeys often attributed to witches and their transportation to demonic gatherings called sabbaths.

An attending inquisitor is shown closely scrutinizing the body of another accused witch, specifically focusing on identifying the presence of a witch's mark. It was believed that a witch's mark, such as a mole, birthmark or additional nipple, was the point through which the devil sealed his pact with the witch. The attending inquisitor would likely be aided by a pricking tool or a sharp instrument to probe the mark, seeking to discern whether the accused felt pain or bled, as the witch's mark was believed to be insensitive and bloodless.

The woodcut also contains various arcane symbols, particularly in the accoutrements of the witch hunters and those gathered to observe the event. This could include elements such as the invocation of saints or prayers for protection against witchcraft, as well as tools like protective amulets that were believed to negate the power of witches.

In conclusion, the "Witch Swimming" engraving from the "Malleus Maleficarum" provides a vivid representation of the methods and beliefs employed during witch trials in the early modern period. The illustration serves not only as a historical record but also as a visual artifact, exposing the societal fears and anxieties surrounding witchcraft that fueled the brutal trials and executions of accused individuals.
