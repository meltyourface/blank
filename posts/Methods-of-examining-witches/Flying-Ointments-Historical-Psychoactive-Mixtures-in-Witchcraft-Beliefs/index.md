The phenomenon of 'flying ointments' can be traced back to the early modern period in Europe (spanning the 15th to the 17th century) when the fear of witchcraft and subsequent witch hunts was at its peak. These ointments were believed to grant witches the ability to fly, exhibit supernatural powers, and participate in sabbats (covens). The use of these ointments played a crucial role in shaping the public's perception of witchcraft and fueled persecution across Europe and the British Isles.

Ingredients and methods of usage:

The recipes for flying ointments were a combination of various herbs, plants, and animal fats. **The most common ingredients included solanaceous plants such as**: 
- Atropa Belladonna (Deadly Nightshade)
- Hyoscyamus niger (Henbane)
- Datura stramonium (Jimsonweed)
- Mandragora officinarum (Mandrake)

Other ingredients often found in these ointments were opium poppy, hemlock, aconite (wolfsbane), and various animal fats, such as those from infants or animals believed to have supernatural properties.

The method of application often involved rubbing anointments on the skin or onto an object like a broomstick to induce the sensation of flight. The absorption of the ointment through the skin was believed to result in visions, trances, and bodily distortions that were perceived as supernatural transformations and the power to fly.

Effects on alleged witches:

The psychoactive properties of the ingredients found in flying ointments, particularly the solanaceous plants, could have induced hallucinations, delirium, and a sense of dissociation from reality. It is believed that the effects produced by these ointments may have led alleged witches to confess to fantastical accounts of flying, shape-shifting, and participating in sabbats during interrogations.

Role in witch hunts:

The belief in witches' ability to fly contributed significantly to the fear and terror surrounding witchcraft, adding an additional layer of perceived danger to society. This belief played a part in the decision-making process of inquisitors, as they searched for signs of witchcraft during interrogations and trials.

Case studies and reconstructed recipes:

Contemporary research into historical recipes for flying ointments reveals that these mixtures contained a wide range of psychoactive substances, with varying effects on the human mind and body. For instance, a recipe attributed to the 16th-century Italian witch Matteuccia di Francesco included Belladonna, opium, and Hemlock, which would have produced hallucinations and a significant physiological response.

Other recipes, such as the one recorded in the 17th-century Spanish Inquisition trial of Ines Esteban y Pere, contained a blend of psychoactive ingredients including henbane and mandrake. This suggests that individuals who used these ointments were likely to have experienced intense psychoactive effects that could have led to confessions of witchcraft.

While the modern mind may view these experiences as mere hallucinations, individuals in the early modern period perceived these trance-like states as evidence of supernatural power, fueling their fear of witchcraft. This further illustrates the significant role that flying ointments played in shaping perceptions of witches, thereby exacerbating their persecution across Europe.

In conclusion, flying ointments played a pivotal role in the historical context of witchcraft accusations by heightening fear and shaping the public's perception of witches. The hallucinogenic effects of these ointments likely induced altered states of consciousness and distorted realities in alleged witches, influencing their testimonies and subsequent trials. By examining case studies and reconstructed recipes, we can gain insight into the possible origins, validity, and psychoactive properties of these notorious concoctions.
