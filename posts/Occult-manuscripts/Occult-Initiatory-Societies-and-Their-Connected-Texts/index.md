To complete this task, we begin by examining the history of occult initiatory societies and their connections to esoteric manuscripts and knowledge transfer.

1. **Ancient Mysteries**: The origins of many occult societies can be traced back to the mystery schools of the ancient world. These schools, such as the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Orphic Mysteries, and the Mysteries of Isis, provided initiates with secret knowledge of divine mysteries through a series of rites and ceremonies.

**Key Manuscripts**: The Greek Magical Papyri, Hermetic Corpus, and the Chaldean Oracles. These texts contain magical spells, rituals, hymns, and other esoteric knowledge associated with mystery schools and their practices.

2. **Kabbalah**: The Jewish mystical tradition dates back to the 1st century CE, with key developments occurring between the 12th and 16th centuries. The Kabbalistic system offers esoteric interpretations of the Torah, with particular focus on the Tree of Life and its ten emanations (Sefirot), through which the knowledge of the divine reality can be attained.

**Key Manuscripts**: The Sefer Yetzirah, Sefer HaBahir, and Sefer HaZohar. These foundational Kabbalistic texts discuss the divine process of creation, the spiritual worlds, and the nature of the soul.

3. **The Hermetic Tradition**: Beginning in Hellenistic Egypt, the Hermetic tradition is an amalgam of Greek, Egyptian, and Jewish spiritual and philosophical ideas, which has exerted a significant influence on many occult societies throughout history. Central to this tradition are the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary wise figure, associated with both the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.

**Key Manuscripts**: The Corpus Hermeticum and the Emerald Tablet. These works contain Hermetic philosophical and alchemical teachings, including the idea of "As above, so below" and the principles of alchemical transformation.

4. **The Rosicrucian Orders**: Dating back to the early 17th century, the Rosicrucians are a network of esoteric organizations, which shares a primary interest in alchemy, mysticism, and the study of ancient wisdom. These societies were influenced by prominent figures like Paracelsus, John Dee, and Giordano Bruno.

**Key Manuscripts**: The Fama Fraternitatis, Confessio Fraternitatis, and Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz. These three documents announced the existence of the Rosicrucian Order and outlined its teachings, goals, and secrets.

5. **Freemasonry**: Emerging in the late 16th century and early 17th century, Freemasonry traces its origins to the medieval stonemason guilds. It developed into a secret fraternal organization that encompasses the esoteric aspects of Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Rosicrucianism, while incorporating moral and ethical principles.

**Key Manuscripts**: The Halliwell Manuscript, Regius Manuscript, and Anderson's Constitutions of 1723. These foundational texts discuss the fraternity's origins, practices, and regulations, as well as its dedication to knowledge and spiritual development.

6. **The Theosophical Society**: Founded in 1875, the Theosophical Society aims to explore and promote universal brotherhood, comparative religion, and the knowledge of hidden metaphysical laws. The society was influenced by the works of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, who sought to synthesize Eastern and Western esoteric thought.

**Key Manuscripts**: The Secret Doctrine, Isis Unveiled, and The Key to Theosophy. These texts by Blavatsky provide a comprehensive and systematic exposition of her teachings, including the evolution of the human spirit and the hidden history of humanity.

7. **The Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)**: Established in the early 20th century, OTO is an international fraternal and religious organization influenced by Aleister Crowley's Thelema philosophy. OTO claims to inherit the teachings and esoteric secrets of the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, and the Rosicrucians, among other organizations.

**Key Manuscripts**: The Book of the Law, Magick in Theory and Practice, and The Vision and the Voice. Crowley's works outline the principles of Thelema and the spiritual practices of the OTO.

The connections between these societies helped facilitate the transfer of esoteric knowledge and fostered the growth of occult wisdom. Influential members, such as John Dee, Cornelius Agrippa, and Aleister Crowley, played critical roles in the preservation, interpretation, and evolution of arcane literature. Furthermore, the relationships between these initiatory societies and their intellectual currents contributed to the development of their diverse esoteric doctrines, rituals, and practices.
