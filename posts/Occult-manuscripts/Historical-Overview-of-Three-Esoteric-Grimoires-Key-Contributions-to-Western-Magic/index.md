To address this knowledge challenge, I shall provide an overview of three prominent grimoires which represent distinct historical periods and cultures, analyze their core teachings and philosophies, and ultimately showcase their convergent contributions to the development of Western esotericism. The chosen grimoires are "The Key of Solomon," "The Book of Abramelin," and "The Lesser Key of Solomon" or "Lemegeton."

1. The Key of Solomon (13th-14th century)
The Key of Solomon is a medieval grimoire attributed to the biblical king Solomon, but it was likely written in the 13th or 14th century in Europe. It is known for its detailed instructions on creating pentacles, tools, and talismans that help the practitioner in various endeavors, such as evoking or controlling spirits, achieving wealth, and gaining love.

Core Teachings
The Key of Solomon emphasizes the importance of purity, both physically and spiritually, in undertaking the complex rituals described in the text. Another central belief is the power of symbols, letters, and sacred names to command and manipulate both celestial and infernal forces.

Contribution to Western Esotericism
The grimoire offers a systematic approach to ceremonial magic that would prove influential on later texts, inspiring techniques and methods that resonated through time. The key concepts of celestial and infernal forces, the value of purity and dedication in practice, and the use of sacred symbols to command these forces all contribute to the foundation of Western esoteric thought.

2. The Book of Abramelin (15th century)
Written in Hebrew and translated into various languages, The Book of Abramelin describes the journey of the mage Abramelin to find a master named Abraham and learn his magical system. The text is most famous for its six-month ritual to obtain the "Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel" and an array of magic squares that allow the operator to summon and bind spirits.

Core Teachings
Abraham's magical system holds great importance on developing a direct relationship with the divine through the Holy Guardian Angel, who assists practitioners in command over elemental, celestial, and infernal spirits. It also insists upon the necessity of daily prayer, contemplation, and purification in order to be successful in one's spiritual and magical work.

Contribution to Western Esotericism
Different from other grimoires, The Book of Abramelin presents a holistic approach to magic, encouraging personal growth and self-improvement along with other magical practices. It had a lasting impact on the concept of spiritual ascent and personal transformation in Western esoteric tradition, as evidenced by the continued usage of various magicians and occult societies, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

3. The Lesser Key of Solomon or Lemegeton (17th century)
A compendium of five different books, Lemegeton dates back to the 17th century and comprises detailed information on the conjuration of spirits, including angelic, elemental, and demonic entities. The most famous section is the "Goetia," which focuses on the 72 spirits of the Ars Goetia, providing their descriptions, sigils, and how to control them.

Core Teachings
The Lesser Key of Solomon advocates a pragmatist's approach to ceremonial magic, focusing primarily on harnessing the energies and abilities of various entities to achieve specific outcomes. It details the importance of meticulous preparation and precise ritual performance in commanding spirits. The text delineates the hierarchy of these spirits and the manner in which they relate to each other, as well as the necessity to establish control over them.

Contribution to Western Esotericism
The Lemegeton played a considerable role in disseminating knowledge about conjuring spirits, shaping the methodologies of ritual magic in Western esotericism. Its emphasis on the hierarchical arrangement of spirits and the importance of control over these entities informed the development of the Western magical tradition.

In conclusion, the three grimoires outlined here – The Key of Solomon, The Book of Abramelin, and the Lesser Key of Solomon – have made significant and unique contributions to the foundations of Western esotericism. Their core teachings emphasize various aspects of occult practice, ranging from the importance of purity and sacred symbolism to the development of personal relationships with divine entities and the pragmatic application of ceremonial magic. As a result of these convergences and the impact of their respective cultural origins, they have shaped the history and philosophy of Western esotericism over many centuries.
