In addressing the knowledge challenge, we shall examine the role of a Pastoral deity in the context of the ever-changing cycles in nature and its complex interconnectivity with all living beings. We will also explore how such a deity showcases its influence on its adherents' agricultural practices, spiritual growth, and perception of the world, while embodying both the beneficial and tumultuous aspects of earthly existence. 

To begin, let us understand that a Pastoral deity can be considered as a divine figure or archetype that presides over the realms of agriculture, fertility, and nature. Such deities are present in different cultural pantheons across history, such as Demeter in Greek mythology, Ceres in Roman mythology, and Osiris in Egyptian mythology, to name a few. Typically, these deities are seen as integral to the perpetual cycles of nature — birth, growth, death, and rebirth — and the cosmos' inherent interconnectedness.

Influence on Agricultural Practices:
Adherents of a Pastoral deity would revere and appeal to these divine forces to oversee and bless their agricultural endeavors. The deity's symbolic presence offers spiritual guidance in understanding and responding to the cycles of nature, especially in time-sensitive agricultural practices such as planting, tending, and harvesting crops. By following the deity's perceived wisdom, devotees may experience higher crop yields, more abundant harvests, and improved food security. Consequently, the Pastoral deity's influence reinforces the need for sustainable and holistic land management practices to maintain the land's fertility and productivity.

Impact on Spiritual Growth:
The role of a Pastoral deity in the lives of its adherents extends beyond the realm of agriculture to also encompass spiritual growth and connection to the natural world. Through religious myths, rituals, and ceremonies dedicated to the deity, devotees foster a sense of reverence and awe for the profound mysteries of nature - both its beauty and its unforgiving aspects. This reverence fosters a holistic approach to spiritual development, enabling a deeper understanding of self, others, and the environment, ultimately leading to a more profound interconnection with the divine.

Shaping Perception of the World:
As the embodiment of both creation and destruction, a Pastoral deity shapes the adherents' worldviews by demonstrating the dualistic nature of life and existence. Devotees are constantly reminded that life is an ever-changing, cyclical process, replete with renewal, growth, decay, and rebirth. This cyclical view fosters an acceptance and understanding of the impermanent nature of all things and can lead to a sense of humility and appreciation for the world's inherent complexity.

Embodying Both Beneficial and Tumultuous Aspects of Earthly Existence:
Throughout history, Pastoral deities have been perceived as conscientious stewards of both the vital and destructive forces of nature. They embody the ever-present tensions between prosperity and scarcity, life and death, and construction and destruction. These contrasts may manifest in the form of bountiful harvests, barren landscapes, floods, and droughts. By embodying these dualistic aspects, a Pastoral deity serves as a profound reminder of the delicate balance that underpins all aspects of life on earth and the inseparability of light and darkness, growth, and decay.

In conclusion, the role of a Pastoral deity in the context of the ever-changing cycles in nature and the complex interconnectivity of all living beings is multifaceted and diverse. A Pastoral deity affects its adherents by shaping agricultural practices, fostering spiritual growth, and influencing their perceptions of the world. Moreover, the deity's dualistic nature reflects both the enriching and destructive forces of life, serving as a powerful reminder of the precarious balance between contrasting elements in the natural world.
