## In the Shadow of the Infernal: The Birth of the Church of Satan

Setting: The play is set between the late 1950s to the late 1960s in San Francisco, California, during the rise of the counterculture movement.

Structure: The play will have three acts, with each act exploring the different stages of the Church of Satan's establishment and influence.

Act I: Awakening the Beast

Scene 1: Introduces Anton Szandor LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan. Anton is shown as a skilled musician and entertainer, often combining his fascination with the occult with his musical performances. In this scene, he hosts a lecture discussing his perspectives on esoteric practices and the shortcomings of modern, conventional religion.

Scene 2: Anton's home, known as the Black House, is revealed to the audience, hinting at its future importance in the establishment of the Church. Anton and his wife, who shares his passion for the occult, conspire to create an organization that provides a unique platform for their beliefs.

Scene 3: A supernatural element is introduced as the spirit of Aleister Crowley, influential British occultist, appears to Anton and offers guidance in creating the new church. This scene delves into the academic side of Satanism, with Crowley and Anton discussing their shared admiration for individualism, self-indulgence, and rationality.

Act II: Rising Inferno

Scene 1: Anton and his followers, now a nascent coven, perform a ritual together. The ritual involves both esoteric symbolism and occult paraphernalia, emphasizing the Church's commitment to theatricality and interacting with supernatural forces. The ritual is successful, bolstering the collective resolve to challenge societal norms and religious tradition.

Scene 2: The Church of Satan is officially founded on April 30, 1966 (Walpurgisnacht). The audience witnesses Anton cut a piece of canvas, symbolizing the separation of the Church from other religious establishments. The Church adopts the Sigil of Baphomet as its emblem, highlighting its connection to the infernal realms.

Scene 3: The Church of Satan gains notoriety, attracting celebrities and people from diverse walks of life. However, the growth comes with opposition from conservative religious groups and the media. The scene shows pivotal media interviews where Anton defends the Church and explains the core tenets of LaVeyan Satanism.

Act III: Unholy Legacy

Scene 1: The Church of Satan evolves with its growing popularity; it begins to influence mainstream entertainment, art, and culture. The scene spotlights cultural figures who have been inspired by the Church and Satanism's principles, like musicians and filmmakers.

Scene 2: The audience witnesses the impact of the Church on societal norms and religious perspectives. Characters debate the Church's controversial doctrines, exploring themes like freedom of religion, ethics, and the role of spirituality in everyday life.

Scene 3: The play concludes with a final, powerful ritual at the Black House. The characters, now part of a larger collective, continue to defy conventions and challenge prevailing paradigms. The ritual ends with a prophetic vision of the future, where the Church of Satan's ideals remain influential and the legacy of Anton LaVey endures.

The theatrical performance utilizes historical information, supernatural elements, and depictions of key figures and events to create a rich, engaging narrative that accurately captures the establishment and influence of the Church of Satan. The play explores the motivations behind the creation of the church, its groundbreaking impact on culture, and its lasting impression on the world.
