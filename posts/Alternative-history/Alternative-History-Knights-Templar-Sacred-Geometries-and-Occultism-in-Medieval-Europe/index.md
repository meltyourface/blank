  In order to respond to this knowledge challenge, let us begin by exploring the history and significance of the Knights Templar in the context of alternative history, their connection to sacred geometries, and the alleged inner circle's practice of occultism. We will then delve into the ways in which these interrelated aspects might impact our understanding of medieval European society. 
  
  The Knights Templar were a medieval Christian military order founded in the early 12th century to protect and aid Christian pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land. The order quickly amassed wealth, land, and political power, making them one of the most influential forces in Europe at the time. In the context of alternative history, the Knights Templar are often depicted as a secretive society with hidden agendas and access to esoteric knowledge, which could have led to the group's eventual downfall in 1307.
  
  One connection the Knights Templar is said to have had is with sacred geometries. The concept of sacred geometry refers to the belief that certain geometric forms, shapes, and patterns hold symbolic and spiritual significance. While some theories suggest the Templars were either guardians or seekers of this knowledge, others claim the Templars were skilled architects and adepts of sacred geometry; this can be seen in their construction of their churches, such as the round church in London, and their strong association with the Gothic architectural style. By utilizing sacred geometries, the Templars might have been able to harness or tap into the metaphysical or spiritual power inherent in these shapes, possibly even influencing the course of history in hidden ways.
  
  The alleged inner circle of the Knights Templar is said to have practiced occultism, inherently connecting with esoteric and supernatural beliefs and practices. Alternative history theories suggest that the Templars might have been in contact with other secretive societies or mystical traditions, such as the Cathars or Gnostic sects, which could have provided them with access to occult knowledge. This secret knowledge and their power to sway influential individuals may have facilitated the Templars' rapid rise in wealth and power during the Middle Ages.
  
  Now, let us explore how these interrelated aspects potentially alter the conventional understanding of the establishment and progress of medieval European society. The involvement of the Knights Templar with sacred geometry and occultism could mean that many of the events and developments during the medieval period were not solely driven by political, economic, or religious factors, as is commonly believed. Instead, this involvement suggests a more complex interplay of esoteric knowledge, secret agendas, and hidden power at work beneath the surface of society.
  
  Additionally, if the Templars were indeed the guardians or seekers of sacred geometry and esoteric knowledge, their downfall could be seen as an attempt by the power structures of the time to suppress this knowledge and maintain control over the populace. The persecution and eventual dissolution of the Templars might be viewed as a battle for ideological dominance, with established orthodoxies seeking to eradicate alternative worldviews and spiritual practices.
  
  In conclusion, the analysis of the alternative history of the secretive society of the Knights Templar, their connection to sacred geometries, and the alleged inner circle's practice of occultism sheds new light on the complexity of medieval European society. Recognizing the influence of these esoteric factors could significantly impact our understanding of the establishment and progress of society in this period, challenging conventional assumptions about the driving forces behind historical events. The interplay of hidden power, secret knowledge, and alternative worldviews might have been more influential than originally believed, and the suppression of the Templars could be seen as an attempt to maintain control by established power structures.
