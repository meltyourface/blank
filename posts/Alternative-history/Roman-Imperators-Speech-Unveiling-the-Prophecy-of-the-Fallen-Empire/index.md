Ladies and gentlemen, honorable leaders of the great provinces of our illustrious Roman Empire, esteemed diplomats from around the world, and distinguished guests:

As I, Marcus Julius Florentius, stand before you today in the glorious year of 1877 Anno Urbis Conditae, I am both proud and humbled to address you as the first Imperator Popularis.

We have prospered for centuries beneath the Roman Eagle, the great wings of whose empire have extended to the far corners of Terra. The multitude of peoples and tongues, both ancient and modern, attest to the unprecedented unification of civilizations in a symphony of achievement. Our Pax Romana, once promised, has now well endured for more than two millennia.

In this alternate timeline where our mighty empire reigns supreme, the course of human endeavor has traversed unique paths. Our cultural heritage has nourished the world with the philosophical strength of the stoics, exemplars such as Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. Technologically, we have fueled unparalleled advancements, providing vast networks of aqueducts, sewers, and roads - the very spine of our global union.

Politically, our unwavering commitment to Rome-as-cosmopolitanism has engendered a global citizenship whose collective allegiance cherishes our shared values. Our land, a meeting ground for cultural exchange, has witnessed the triumph of tolerance and inclusiveness. Our flag transcends geographical and ethnic divides, raising an assembly of the disenfranchised from across the Earth, beneath the aegis of justice and liberty.

Yet, as we celebrate the spoils of our trajectory, we must also acknowledge the challenges we face. Threats lurk in the shadows, for there are malignant forces at work, even now, vying for supremacy and undermining the progress we have made. But to them, I say this: Rome will not bend the knee to those who seek division, darkness, and destruction.

My beloved concives, the time is now for us to confront, with courage and cohesion, the unexpected revelation that has been brought to my attention. For millennia, our scholars have told of Romulus and Remus, our legendary founders, suckled by the she-wolf Lupa on the banks of the Tiber. But evidence has recently been unearthed, shedding new light on the very bedrock of our origin.

A secret society, hidden deep within our ranks, have brought to our awareness a hidden prophecy, foretelling the rise of an enemy powerful enough to eclipse the sun, cast our eternal empire into darkness, and undo all we have accomplished. And they are among us, unknown yet watchful, plotting our demise.

Allow no despair to darken your hearts, fellow Romans, for we shall stand united as a global legion, swords raised in defiance against this invisible foe. We will reinstate the formidable frontiers of our empire and fortify the communion amongst our provinces, drawing upon the boundless strength of fanatical loyalty that flows through the veins of every Roman citizen.

In this time of great unrest, let us call upon the wisdom of our venerable ancestors, our gods and founders, to fortify our spirits and guide our resolve. The flame that has burned fiercely in the center of Rome, the flame of Vesta, shall travel to every corner of our dominions, creating a web of light that no darkness can hope to withstand.

Fear not, my fellow Romans, for we shall vanquish this unseen adversary. Invictus, indestructible, and eternal, the Roman Empire shall prevail!
