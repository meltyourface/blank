Historically, the development of popular literature appears to be significantly shaped by the influence of occultism and radical alterity. The incorporation of esoteric symbols, otherworldly beings, and metaphysical concepts into notable works has not only enriched the literary spectrum, but also opened gateways to discussions around disparate worldviews, cultural implications, and transformative effects. Besides, the intersection between popular literature and underground countercultures manifests through shared themes and iconographies.

Notable literary works — such as Arthur Machen's "The Great God Pan," H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu," and Aleister Crowley's "Moonchild" — offer evidence of the impact of the occult and metaphysical concepts on popular literature. These texts tend to explore themes such as supernatural entities, hidden dimensions, forbidden knowledge, magic rituals, and divergent realities.

The influence of esotericism and radical alterity can be found beyond horror and speculative fiction, as demonstrated in other literary works and genres. Examples include the eponymous character in Goethe's "Faust," the allusions to alchemical transmutation in "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho, and the exploration of spiritualism in James Joyce's "Ulysses."

The incorporation of occult themes goes beyond the literary value, presenting cultural implications and transformative effects. For instance, these themes may inspire readers to delve into alternative belief systems or worldview, fuel curiosities about the supernatural and metaphysics, and challenge traditional paradigms.

Additionally, esotericism in literature often provides a foundation for social commentaries. By incorporating occult and otherworldly elements, authors may reflect on the human condition, ponder existential questions, and perceive societal constructs through a different lens. Such literature enables readers to entertain multiple perspectives, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of various themes.

The intersection of popular literature and underground countercultures finds a common ground in shared themes, symbols, and philosophies. Countercultural movements often draw inspiration from occult, metaphysical, and esoteric ideas. This interrelation can be seen in the Beat Generation's fascination with Eastern religions and mystical symbolism or in the Punk movement's embrace of anarchism and anti-establishment ideologies.

In conclusion, the influence of occultism and radical alterity within popular literature has profoundly shaped its development, providing readers with a diverse array of thought-provoking themes and ideas. By assessing the incorporation of esoteric symbols, otherworldly beings, and metaphysical concepts, it becomes evident that these elements add richness and complexity to various texts. As a result, popular literature represents a vital nexus between the mainstream and underground countercultures, ultimately fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the human experience.
