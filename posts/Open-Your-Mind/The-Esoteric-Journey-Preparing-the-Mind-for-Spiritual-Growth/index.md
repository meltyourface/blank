This section of the grimoire will prepare the initiate to open their mind and embark on a journey to discover the hidden dimensions of reality.

**1. Cultivating the Right Mindset**

Before diving into specific techniques, it is vital to establish a mental foundation that will support the journey into the realm of occult and esoteric knowledge. **The initiate must develop these qualities**:
