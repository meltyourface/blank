The significance of Chaos as a sealing word and its symbolism in the ritual practices of witch-hunting are astoundingly rich and complex, with extensive historical and cultural influences. To fully comprehend this intricate relationship, it is important to break down their individual concepts before exploring the connections between them. In this analysis, we will explore the concept of Chaos as a sealing word, its role in ritualistic practices, the symbolism and goals of witch-hunting, and the potential psychological impacts on both target and practitioner.

Chaos, as a concept, represents disorder and the unformed void that often precedes existence and creation. The term 'Chaos' originates from ancient Greek mythology and was used to describe the primeval state of the universe, an abyss where all elements existed in a state of confusion. In occult practices, the word Chaos often denotes a transformative force that holds the potential for dissolution and recreation. As a sealing word, it serves to contain and direct energy, providing focus and structure to the practitioner's intentions.

In contrast, witch-hunting is a practice born from fear and misunderstanding. Historically, it originates from the belief in the malevolent power of witches and the necessity to identify and eliminate these individuals to ensure society's safety. Witch-hunting is symbolic of the desire to maintain control and preserve the established order by rooting out deviant elements. The ritual practices of witch-hunting vary greatly and often include trial by ordeal, forced confessions, and various forms of social or physical punishment.

When Chaos is incorporated as a sealing word in the ritual practices of witch-hunting, it takes on a unique role reflective of its dual nature as both chaotic and transformative. On one hand, invoking Chaos can instill fear and disorder within the target, activating the primal instincts associated with self-preservation. This intensifies the emotional response, thus providing the practitioner with a powerful psychological advantage. 

On the other hand, using Chaos as a sealing word can evoke a sense of control and mastery for the practitioner. It represents the ability to wield and manipulate the raw, chaotic forces of the universe to achieve a particular objective â€“ in this case, the identification and removal of a perceived threat.

The psychological effect on the target of witch-hunting can be dire. The accusation and stigma attached to being labeled a witch often result in profound feelings of isolation, despair, and hopelessness. This emotional turmoil might force the target to internalize the accusations and doubt their integrity, even leading to self-destructive behavior.

For the practitioner, employing Chaos in the context of witch-hunting symbolizes an assertion of authority and imbues them with a sense of righteousness. However, this self-perception may be tainted by the underlying fear motivating the witch-hunt. Thus, the practitioner may grapple with their moral compass and must balance the desire to maintain societal order with potential consequences for the targeted individual.

In conclusion, the key themes explored include the complexity of Chaos as a sealing word, the symbolism in witch-hunting practices, and the psychological implications for both the target and the practitioner. Chaos symbolizes a transformative force greater than the established order, while witch-hunting represents an attempt to safeguard the status quo. Incorporating Chaos as a sealing word in witch-hunting rituals allows for a unique interplay between these seemingly opposed concepts, resulting in profound psychological effects. The target may experience confusion, fear, and internal strife, while the practitioner gains a heightened sense of power and control, potentially clouding their moral and ethical judgment.
