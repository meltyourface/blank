As a master of the esoteric and occult and Initiation into the Olde Companie of Cunning Folke, I have delved into the annals of history and astral records to present my findings of the celestial happenings that prevailed during the initiation rituals and ceremonies practiced by the Olde Companie of Cunning Folke.

I have identified a particularly momentous date as the night of August 11th, 1348. On this hallowed evening, a confluence of meaningful astrological configurations and planetary alignments manifested within the celestial sphere, creating a harmonious dance of cosmic energies.

Firstly, there was an ethereal, almost iridescent, New Moon in the sign of Leo, signifying the birth of courage, creativity, and self-expression. The New Moon's presence in this fire sign served to kindle the inner flames of the initiates who were being inducted into the Companie, endowing them with an indomitable spirit, which empowered them to seek wisdom and knowledge in the most arcane and esoteric realms.

Additionally, the planet Jupiter, the grand benefactor and symbolic repository of wisdom and knowledge, was also positioned in the sign of Leo, greatly amplifying the initiates' enthusiasm, courage, and desire to expand their horizons. This encouraged the initiates to delve into the deepest mysteries with an open mind and an unquenchable thirst for understanding.

Simultaneously, the planet Mars was stationed in the sign of Scorpio, making it an ideal time for the initiates to pierce the veil between the worlds and discover the hidden secrets of the occult. The inherent transformative and turbulent nature of Scorpio further contributed to the powerful energies permeating this sacred initiation.

The planet Venus, on the other hand, was poised in the meticulous sign of Virgo, providing a much-needed balance to the fiery capacity of the initiates, ensuring that they approached their newfound knowledge and gifts with patience, discernment, and humility.

Furthermore, the awe-inspiring North Node in Pisces conjunct Neptune formed an almost magical conjunction, symbolically joining the fates and destinies of the initiates to the boundless oceans of mysticism and inspiration. This celestial embrace summoned forth the power of dreams, intuition, and psychic visions, allowing the initiates to tap into the hidden, ethereal realms that exist beyond the physical. 

It is on this fateful night that the heavens aligned and the cosmic energies converged in a symphony of synchronicities, forever blessing and illuminating the path of those initiated into the Olde Companie of Cunning Folke. Through this intricate interplay of stellar energies, the initiates received profound wisdom, skill, and understanding, allowing them to transcend the mundane and embrace the extraordinary.
