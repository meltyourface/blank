To fully address the knowledge challenge, let us first establish an understanding of the essential concepts. The Olde Companie of Cunning Folke is a designation denoting a broad spectrum of practitioners who were engaged in various esoteric and occult activities, usually within a rural or pre-modern society context. Cunning Men and Cunning Women were folk magicians, healers, and wise individuals who offered their services to the local population. The roles of these practitioners were rooted in their communities' needs, their personal experience and knowledge, as well as their connections to the numinous forces.

The Four Elements (Earth, Water, Air, and Fire) and the Triple Goddess (Maiden, Mother, and Crone) represent two fundamental aspects of the occult and esoteric worldview, structuring the effective practice and philosophy of the Cunning Folke.

Now, let's analyze the roles of the Cunning Man and the Cunning Woman, discussing their similarities and differences, and how the Four Elements and the Triple Goddess play instrumental roles in their respective practices.

Cunning Man:

The Cunning Man was often engaged in various roles, encompassing aspects of divination, healing, spellcasting, and providing magical protection or removal of curses or bewitchment. He was expected to work with spirits, deities, and the natural world, drawing upon their powers when performing his tasks. The practice of the Cunning Man incorporated the Four Elements as a means of understanding the relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm, and as a way to harness nature's energies. He might use herbal concoctions related to each of the Elements to provide remedies to physical and spiritual ailments or utilize elemental symbols in his protective charms and sigils.

The Triple Goddess would also play an essential role within the Cunning Man's work. He would pay reverence to the Maiden, Mother, and Crone as a manifestation of the cyclical nature of existence, acknowledging that each stage of life holds wisdom and significance. He may invoke the Triple Goddess's aspects during spells or rituals, invoking their powers to aid in his magical workings.

Cunning Woman:

The Cunning Woman's role was similar to the Cunning Man's, with a few noteworthy differences. Her primary focus was often on midwifery, childbirth, and reproductive health. With her knowledge of plants and their medicinal properties, she provided remedies and healing care to her community. Her practice likely resonated more with the Earth element, considering her connection to herbs, plants, and the nurturing aspects of nature.

The Triple Goddess was of particular importance for the Cunning Woman. Through her connection to childbirth, she embodied the aspects of the Maiden, Mother, and Crone, witnessing the stages of life, and providing guidance and care at each stage. She might call upon the Triple Goddess during rites of passage, such as births, marriages, and deaths, or in spells and rituals related to fertility, protection, and women's health.

To summarize, both Cunning Men and Cunning Women served essential roles within the Olde Companie of Cunning Folke, yet their focuses were distinct. Cunning Men were predominantly known for their abilities in divination, healing, and magical protection, while Cunning Women focused on midwifery, reproductive health, and women's rites of passage. The Four Elements and the Triple Goddess were vital aspects of their magical philosophies and practice, embodying the interdependent relationships between the natural world, humanity, and the divine. While their practices might differ, their core objective was to assist their communities using their specialized knowledge and expertise in the esoteric realm.
