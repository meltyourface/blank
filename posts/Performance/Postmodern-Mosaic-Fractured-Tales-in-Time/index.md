## Title: Fractured Fables

**Setting**: A contemporary cityscape that extends to fictional and historical settings.

**Summary**: Fractured Fables is an immersive theatrical performance that masterfully weaves together classic and original tales, utilizing postmodern narrative techniques such as intertextuality, metafiction, and temporal distortion to create a story like no other. Audience members will journey through a series of fragmented scenes brought together under a unified theme, offering a rich and unexpected divergence from traditional storytelling structures.

Act 1: The Awakening

Scene 1: The Narrator's Dilemma
- The play starts with a Narrator who is facing writer's block, recalling fragments of classic stories like "Alice in Wonderland," "Sherlock Holmes," and "Frankenstein."
- Metafiction – the Narrator converses with the characters on-stage, questioning the line between reality and fiction.

Scene 2: Alternate Histories
- The Narrator somehow gains control over the stories, leading to an alternate history where literary characters exist in the contemporary cityscape.
- Temporal distortion – time periods collide as modern-day characters encounter historical figures.

Act 2: Unraveling the Threads

Scene 3: Meeting in the Middle
- As the story progresses, characters create their narratives as they cross paths, dissolving the boundaries between the stories.
- Intertextuality – allusions and nods to the original tales abound, subtly drawing connections between characters and stories.

Scene 4: A Question of Identity
- Characters experience confusion as their narratives take unexpected turns, reconsidering their roles.
- Fragmented narrative – each character tells the same story from their perspective, creating a disjointed but overlapping mosaic of events.

Act 3: A Tapestry Complete

Scene 5: Distorted Narratives
- Through a series of twists and turns, the characters discover that their choices have consequences.
- Metafiction – the lines between audience, actor, and character blur as the Narrator assumes various roles in the story.

Scene 6: The Final Shatter
- The Narrator realizes that a rigid, linear story is not necessary and embraces the chaos of interwoven narratives.
- Temporal distortion – scenes jump between past, present, and future, illustrating the fluidity of the postmodern storytelling structure.

Fractured Fables celebrates the complexity and richness of the postmodern style by deliberately constructing a fragmented and nonlinear narrative. Through the use of temporal distortion, metafiction, and intertextuality, the performance challenges traditional storytelling expectations and invites the audience to reconsider the power of narrative as a compelling force.
