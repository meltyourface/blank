To design an intricate personal power sigil using Seals and sigilsMystery techniques, follow these steps:

1. **Define your intention**: The purpose of this sigil is to surmount individual impediments such as anxiety, procrastination, or self-doubt. This will require focusing on the specific qualities and symbolism that resonate with these obstacles.

2. **Select appropriate symbolism**: For anxiety, use symbols of calmness and tranquility, such as water or the infinity symbol. For procrastination, utilize symbols of progress, motivation, and time, such as an arrow or hourglass. For self-doubt, incorporate symbols of confidence and inner strength, such as a lion or a sturdy oak tree.

3. **Establish color associations**: Assign colors that support your intention and represent the obstacles clearly. For anxiety, use soothing blues or greens; for procrastination, motivating oranges or reds; and for self-doubt, empowering golds or purples.

4. **Design interlocking geometric shapes**: Layer three interlocking geometric shapes that embody aspects of the obstacles you wish to overcome. For anxiety, a circle represents completion and wholeness; for procrastination, a square illustrates stability and structure; and for self-doubt, a triangle symbolizes growth and ascension.

5. **Combine the elements**: Intertwine the symbols, colors, and geometric shapes harmoniously, resulting in an intricate sigil design. The final sigil should incorporate aspects of calmness, progress, and confidence, as well as the interlocking geometric shapes to empower the sigil.

6. **Consecrate the sigil in a dedicated ritual**: To activate its transformative properties, perform a ritual to consecrate the sigil. Choose a suitable time and place, cleanse the area with sage or incense, and light candles in the colors chosen earlier. Meditate on the sigil and your intentions, allowing its energy to flow into your consciousness. Optionally, anoint the sigil with essential oils, such as lavender for tranquility, cinnamon for motivation, or frankincense for confidence.

7. **Empower the sigil**: Charge the sigil by focusing your intention and energy on it. Visualize the obstacles dissipating and imagine yourself embodying the qualities represented in the sigil. Declare the sigil as a tool to help you surmount your individual impediments, using your power and the power within the sigil.

8. **Seal the ritual**: Close the ritual by expressing gratitude for the creation and activation of the sigil. Extinguish the candles, carefully store the sigil in a safe place, and carry it with you as a reminder of its transformative properties.

By following these steps, you've now created an intricate personal power sigil using Seals and sigilsMystery techniques to help you overcome anxiety, procrastination and self-doubt.
