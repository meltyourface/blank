The common thread between the Seal of Solomon, the Sigil of Baphomet, and John Dee's Sigillum Dei Aemeth lies in their connection to various forms of esotericism and occult practices, symbolizing power and knowledge. These three symbols originate from different cultures and time periods, yet have become influential within the Western esoteric tradition.

1. ****Seal of Solomon****: Also known as the Star of David, this symbol comprises two overlapping equilateral triangles forming a hexagram. Widely associated with King Solomon, it is linked to his purported mastery over spirits and demons. In this context, the Seal of Solomon represents the union of opposites, such as the masculine and feminine principles, and is also linked to alchemy, protection, and harmonizing energies.

2. ****Sigil of Baphomet****: This symbol is associated with the Church of Satan and modern Satanism. It features an inverted pentagram, with a goat's head superimposed on it. The Sigil of Baphomet represents the balance and synthesis of contrasting forces, such as elements and matter, light and darkness. Additionally, it is emblematic of the material world and humanity's pursuit of knowledge and power.

3. ****Sigillum Dei Aemeth****: Developed by the famous occultist and mathematician John Dee, this complex symbol is composed of concentric circles with various divine names and angelic inscriptions. The Sigillum Dei Aemeth was utilized in Enochian Magick for communication with angels and accessing higher realms of knowledge. Therefore, it represents a connection to divine powers and a sense of transcending the earthly realm.

To synthesize these sigils into an entirely new sigil embodying their combined esoteric attributes, one would need to combine their symbolism, integrating aspects of the balance of opposites, the pursuit of knowledge and power, and the connection to divine powers or consciousness. **Following is a step-by-step process to create such a sigil**:
**Step 1**: Begin with the hexagram from the Seal of Solomon, representing the union of opposites and harmonizing energies.
**Step 2**: Superimpose the goat's head from the Sigil of Baphomet within the hexagram, symbolizing the balance of contrasting forces and humanity's drive for knowledge and power.
**Step 3**: Surround the combination of the hexagram and goat's head with the concentric circles from the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, integrating divine names and angelic inscriptions to represent a connection to higher realms and transcendence.
**Step 4**: Optionally, customize and refine the sigil by incorporating additional symbols or inscriptions to emphasize specific attributes or intentions.

In conclusion, the common thread between the Seal of Solomon, the Sigil of Baphomet, and John Dee's Sigillum Dei Aemeth lies in their representation of esoteric power, knowledge, and the synthesis of contrasting forces. Creating a new sigil that combines these elements would manifest a potent symbol embodying a balance of opposites, the pursuit of knowledge, and the connection to higher powers and broadened consciousness. This synthesis would be a unique representation of these combined attributes, with the potential to be utilized in various practices and rituals within the esoteric and occult realm.
