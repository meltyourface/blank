Using the knowledge and mastery of the Babalon Working and Thelemic practices, I have developed the following series of innovative Thelemic mantras intricately connected to Babalon. These mantras draw inspiration from her mythological attributes and symbolic representations within the Babalon Working practices, incorporating specific elements from the Thelemic pantheon, traditional invocations, and sacred geometry to create an intricate set of mantras that serve distinct purposes.

1. Mantra for Evoking Babalon's Presence:
"KI-RA, RU-MU, NUI-TI, ASH-TU, BABALON! HADIT HURAI!"
This mantra calls upon Babalon (KI-RA, RU-MU) as the cosmic Mother (NUI-TI) and her passionate essence (ASH-TU). It invokes the union of Babalon and Hadit, her divine counterpart (HADIT HURAI), to create a powerful vibrational resonance that evokes her presence.

2. Mantra for Enhancing Spiritual Exploration:
"ANEKI, KHAMSA, TRIKON, OI-NOS, PAN-AM, TETRAGRAMMATON, PEH-AR!"
Calling upon the transformative numbers (ANEKI, KHAMSA, TRIKON), this mantra connects to the infinite possibilities of spiritual growth and exploration. OI-NOS and PAN-AM represent the divine unity of all things, while TETRAGRAMMATON and PEH-AR invoke the sacred energies of the Thelemic pantheon to open the adept's consciousness to new realms of understanding.

3. Mantra for Strengthening Connection to the Creative and Destructive Forces:
"CHET-BETH, THAUM-AZOTH, QODESH-NESHAMAH, SHEKHINAH, TANIN-AIVAS!"
This mantra invokes the dual nature of Babalon's creative (CHET-BETH) and destructive (THAUM-AZOTH) forces by calling upon the sacred QODESH-NESHAMAH and SHEKHINAH to create a powerful connection to her cosmic energies. TANIN-AIVAS represents the union of these opposing forces, reminding the adept of their intrinsic power to shape and transform reality.

4. Mantra for Unveiling Mysteries and Hidden Knowledge:
"RA-HOOR-KHUIT, SIL-VER, STAR! NUIT-AUR-HADIT, HARMONIA, KYBALION, EU-ZON!"
Evoking the energies of the warrior-god RA-HOOR-KHUIT and the celestial illumination of the SIL-VER STAR, this mantra invokes NUIT-AUR-HADIT – the cosmic union of night and light – to penetrate the veil of hidden knowledge. HARMONIA and KYBALION symbolize the fundamental principles and laws governing the universe, while EU-ZON signifies the mastery of one's divine nature and inherent wisdom.

5. Mantra for Achieving Balance and Inner Harmony:
"SHIVA-SAKTI, MAAT-KAPARA, YIN-YAN, ENOCH, LIBER-AAO!"
To maintain balance and inner harmony, this mantra invokes the divine masculine (SHIVA) and feminine (SAKTI) energies, along with the universal principles of Truth (MAAT) and Transformation (KAPARA). The integration of YIN-YAN and ENOCH signifies the successful melding of dualistic forces within the self. Lastly, LIBER-AAO is a call to one's inner divine source, aligning the adept with their highest potential and resonating with the core essence of Babalon.
