## Babalon Working: Unveiling the Scarlet Woman

### I. Introduction

The Babalon Working is an occult ritual and practice stemming from the Thelemic tradition, with the aim of invoking the powerful and enigmatic figure known as Babalon or the Scarlet Woman. This practice has its roots in the esoteric work of Aleister Crowley and was famously undertaken by rocket scientist Jack Parsons and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in the mid-20th century. It is a complex and provocative practice that promises transformative experiences for those who engage with it.

### II. History of the Babalon Working

A. Origins in Thelema

The figure of Babalon and the concept of the Scarlet Woman are deeply connected to the Thelemic religion, founded by notorious British occultist Aleister Crowley. The Book of the Law, considered the foundational sacred text of Thelema, declares Babalon as the embodiment of both erotic sensual energy and mystical liberation. The verse "Babalon is the Mother of Abominations" encapsulates her transformative aspect and also her paradoxical nature.

B. Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard

Occultist and rocket scientist Jack Parsons, intrigued by the concept of Babalon, sought to invoke her presence along with his associate L. Ron Hubbard in the 1940s. This series of rituals became known as the Babalon Working, a phrase highlighting the active, working nature of their practice. Although Parsons proclaimed success in the operation, their collaboration later dissolved, and the original Babalon Working remains controversial.

### III. Key Concepts and Practices

A. The Figure of Babalon

Babalon, also known as the Scarlet Woman, is a central figure within Thelemic cosmogony. She embodies divine feminine energy, sexual power, and mystical insight. Her sigil, known as the Seal of Babalon, is a representation of the Holy Grail or Chalice, which symbolizes her capacity to receive and gestate spiritual energies within her womb.

B. The Purpose of the Babalon Working

The primary aim of the Babalon Working is to invoke and establish a connection with the force and archetype of Babalon, in order to achieve transcendence, transformation, and the realization of the true divine will. Through their interaction with Babalon, initiates can gain access to wisdom, power, and insight, as well as unlocking their own innate magical potential.

C. The Practice and Ritual Components

The Babalon Working consists of a series of ritual components that incorporate both Thelemic and Chaos Magick principles, including the ritual use of the Septagram (a seven-pointed star associated with the planetary forces), invocation of the Enochian Calls (a magical language said to communicate with angelic and otherworldly entities), and the performance of sex magick (using sexual arousal and pleasure as a means of achieving mystical states of consciousness).

### IV. Practical Advice for Engaging in Babalon Working

A. Preparation and Purification

Before undertaking the Babalon Working, it is essential to prepare oneself mentally, emotionally, and physically. This may include regular meditation, a practice of ceremonial magick, and the development of a strong foundation in occult knowledge and principles.

B. Defining One's Intent

Clarity of intent plays a critical role in the success of the Babalon Working. Initiates should begin by clearly defining and understanding their goals, whether it be attaining spiritual awakening, achieving personal transformation, or manifesting specific desires.

C. Collaboration and Success

As the Babalon Working can be an intense and demanding practice, it may be advisable to work in partnership with other experienced practitioners or within a supportive magical community. Patience, perseverance, and ongoing reflection on one's practice and results are essential for those who genuinely seek to unlock the mysteries of Babalon and her transformative power.

In conclusion, the Babalon Working is a profound and complex esoteric practice intended for those who are ready to explore the depths of their own consciousness and the hidden wisdom of the divine feminine. By understanding its history, key concepts, and the necessary preparation, those who venture forth may find themselves transformed in unimaginable ways.
