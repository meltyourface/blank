To create a symbolic sigil dedicated to the Canaanite God Mot, I will follow the detailed guidelines provided and focus on the Canaanite symbolism of death, the underworld, and the natural cycles. I will incorporate intricate geometric patterns and motifs representing Mot's dominion over death, alongside relevant agricultural symbols indicative of the seasonal cycles. The sigil will incorporate ancient Canaanite script to evoke Mot's name and power, ensuring it serves as an effective tool in ritualistic practices devoted to this enigmatic deity.

The sigil can be structured as follows:

1. Start with a base of a downward pointing triangle, representing the descent into the underworld. This symbolizes Mot's connection to the underworld and his rule over it.

2. Within the triangle, depict a stylized skull as the central motif, representing death and the power Mot holds over it. You can use elongated, abstract shapes and lines to create a unique and intricate skull design.

3. Incorporate various geomorphic patterns and symbols related to the seasonal cycles around the skull. These can include symbols for the sun, moon, and rain, as well as representations of seeds, grain, and plant growth. These elements will symbolize the natural cycles and the connection between life and death governed by Mot.

4. Weave in elements of bones throughout the design – such as ribcage-like structures or bone-like branches – to emphasize Mot's association with death and decay.

5. To include ancient Canaanite script, use the Phoenician alphabet, which is the oldest verified consonantal alphabet. Write "𐤌𐤕" for Mot's name around the edges of the triangle. Additionally, you can incorporate phrases like "𐤌𐤕 𐤇𐤄𐤋𐤊 𐤃𐤁𐤉𐤌" (Mot brings life from death) and "𐤌𐤕 𐤃𐤁𐤉𐤌 𐤇𐤄𐤋𐤊" (Mot rules the cycles) to evoke his dominion over death and the natural cycles.

6. Finally, to complete the sigil, add a surrounding circle to enclose and contain the power of the sigil. This reinforces the sigil's potency and helps channel the energies conjured during ritualistic practices.

This resulting sigil will be a complex and intricate representation of Mot, incorporating elements of death, the underworld, and the natural cycles while evoking his name and power through ancient Canaanite script. This sigil will serve as a potent tool in rituals devoted to the enigmatic deity of Mot.
