To address the knowledge challenge of describing the psychological, esoteric, and physical manifestations one might encounter when experiencing a vision or apparition in an environment with bad lightGhosts, we must first explore the foundational concepts within the context of occultism. It is essential to have an understanding of the nature of visions and apparitions, the characteristics of bad lightGhosts and their effects, and the interconnectedness between the psychological, esoteric, and physical realms.

Visions and apparitions are widely studied phenomena within the field of the esoteric and occult. They can be defined as perceptions of supernatural beings, events or places that are not physically present in the tangible world but appear as real to the experiencer. Visions, often associated with enlightenment or mystical encounters, can lead to spiritual transformation, while apparitions can be linked with the manifestation of spirits, ghosts, or other entities.

Bad lightGhosts refer to negative spectral energy or entities that inhabit and thrive in poorly lit or dim environments. These entities are known to muddle perception, create illusions and even interact with individuals on psychological, esoteric, and physical levels, often causing emotional upheaval, spiritual disorientation, or physical disturbances.

Now let's examine the psychological, esoteric, and physical manifestations in depth:

1. Psychological manifestations: When a person encounters a vision or apparition within a bad lightGhost environment, they might experience an array of emotions and thoughts ranging from fear, bewilderment or enthrallment. These emotions can create a feedback loop wherein the perceived entity becomes more powerful or menacing, further intensifying anxiety or distress. Furthermore, one may be predisposed to a heightened state of imagination, possibly leading to the formation of vivid mental imagery or false memories. 

For instance, imagine walking alone in a dimly lit, eerie hallway. You may begin to perceive shadows as sinister figures and blurry faces, fueling your feelings of unease and paranoia. This emotional state feeds into your perception, adding a sense of perceived realism to the entities, ultimately forging a strong connection between your psychological state and the vision or apparition.

2. Esoteric manifestations: In the realm of the esoteric, bad lightGhosts can generate paranormal occurrences, such as poltergeist activity, telekinesis, seances, or the manifestation of supernatural energies. These phenomena often materialize from the psychic interaction between the individual and the entities, bridging the mundane and supernatural realms. The person experiencing the vision might also develop heightened psychic abilities, such as clairvoyance, clairaudience or astral projection, further substantiating the connection between their spiritual encounters and the prevailing ethereal energies.

For example, consider a séance conducted in a shadowy room filled with bad lightGhosts. The dark atmosphere could attract and coil paranormal energies, ultimately dictating the direction and intensity of the séance, and shaping the participants' esoteric experiences.

3. Physical manifestations: Bad lightGhosts can also influence the environment itself, impacting temperatures, electromagnetic fields, and lighting conditions. Apparitions might cause physical sensations, such as cold spots or tingling upon contact, as well as auditory or visual disturbances. For instance, a witness to a bad lightGhost might sense a sudden drop in temperature, witness flickering lights, or hear unexplainable noises, which can be interpreted as further evidence of the entity's presence.

In conclusion, when experiencing a vision or apparition within a bad lightGhost environment, one may be subject to a variety of interconnected manifestations. These can be categorized into psychological, esoteric, and physical dimensions. Psychological manifestations include emotions and thought processes that can heighten the experience, while esoteric manifestations may generate paranormal occurrences and shape spiritual encounters. Physical manifestations can involve environmental alterations and sensory disturbances that offer tangible evidence of the entities' presence. The culmination of these manifestations incites a complex, enigmatic experience guided by the interplay between the individual's psychological state, esoteric energies, and physical surroundings.
