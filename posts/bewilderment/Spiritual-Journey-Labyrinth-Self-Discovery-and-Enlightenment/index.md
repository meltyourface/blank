The labyrinth I have designed is intended to guide visitors along a transformative journey of self-discovery, introspection, and realization of hidden truths related to their relationships to the universe, spirituality, and personal growth.

The entrance of the labyrinth is marked by an intricately carved doorway featuring two pillars representing duality – light and dark, good and evil, masculine and feminine – reminding visitors that balance is necessary both externally and internally. Engraved upon the archway are astrological symbols, such as the zodiac signs, planets, and celestial bodies, which emphasize the interconnectedness of humans with the cosmos.

The labyrinth's overall shape is inspired by sacred geometry, particularly the flower of life and the golden spiral, symbolizing the interconnectedness of all things and nature's tendency toward harmony and symmetry. The walls, constructed from smooth, weathered stone, rise high and create a sense of being enclosed, encouraging inward focus and reflection.

Throughout the labyrinth, three key enigmatic puzzles appear: the Alchemical Labyrinth, the Tree of Life, and the Tarot.

1. **The Alchemical Labyrinth**: This puzzle, spread across the labyrinth's various intersections, represents the journey of self-purification and transformation. Participants must locate and arrange alchemical sigils in the correct sequence to open hidden passageways and progress through the initiation process.

2. **The Tree of Life**: Representing various planes of existence and aspects of the human soul, visitors must follow paths that correspond with the ten Sephiroth or spheres of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Each sphere represents a divine emanation, offering participants a chance to reflect on their own spiritual attributes and explore deeper, esoteric insights.

3. **The Tarot**: This puzzle weaves Major Arcana cards, the suits of Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles, and the four elements – Air, Fire, Water, and Earth – throughout the labyrinth. Participants must decipher symbolic clues and unravel the tarot's meanings in order to navigate the maze with success.

These puzzles engage both the conscious and subconscious mind through symbolism, numerology, and other occult elements. Visitors must use their mental prowess and emotional intuition to thoroughly explore each challenge presented, only reaching heightened self-awareness and spiritual growth by working through the entire experience holistically.

Hidden alcoves and quiet corners throughout the labyrinth contain intricately designed frescoes depicting ancient myths, gods, goddesses, and various transcendental experiences - further inspiring introspection and contemplation of the metaphysical realm.

At the heart of the labyrinth lies a serene, secret chamber beneath a glass dome filled with crystalline prisms that refract light, creating an ethereal ambiance. Here, weary travelers can experience a profound sense of self-discovery and revelation, with newfound wisdom imparted via their journey through the bewildering maze.

In conclusion, this bewildering labyrinth provides a transformative experience, utilizing sacred geometry, astrology, enigmatic puzzles, and occult symbolism to engage visitors fully and guide them toward heightened spiritual understanding and self-awareness. It serves as a genuine tool of introspection and an in-depth exploration of the hidden realms of the psyche.
