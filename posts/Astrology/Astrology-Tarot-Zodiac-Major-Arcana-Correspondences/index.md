To properly answer this challenge, we must first delve into the rich tapestry of Astrology, Tarot, and their connections. Each of the twelve zodiac signs is associated with a ruling planet, which governs its qualities, traits, and characteristics. The Tarot, particularly the Major Arcana, also has associations with both the zodiac signs and the planets. By understanding these symbolic correspondences, we can gain a deeper understanding of an individual's astrological chart and their personal journey.

Before we start identifying the relationships between the zodiac signs, ruling planets, and Major Arcana, let us understand the key components:

1. **Zodiac Signs**: The twelve zodiac signs form the basis of Astrology, dividing the celestial sphere into twelve parts, each representing specific characteristics and attributes.

2. **Ruling Planets**: Each zodiac sign is governed by a ruling planet, influencing the sign's qualities, traits, and characteristics.

3. **Tarot - Major Arcana**: The Major Arcana, in the Tarot, consists of 22 cards with deeply symbolic images, representing the journey of the soul through life's major events and challenges.

Now, let's explore the symbolic correspondences between the zodiac signs, their ruling planets, and the associated Major Arcana cards:

1. Aries - Ruled by Mars - The Emperor
Aries, a fire sign, embodies qualities such as leadership, initiative, and assertiveness. The Emperor card embodies authority and structure and is also associated with the astrological sign Aries, symbolizing a firm guiding hand, much like what we find in Aries and its ruling planet Mars.

2. Taurus - Ruled by Venus - The Hierophant
Taurus, an earth sign, signifies security, perseverance, and practicality. The Hierophant card aligns with the values and beliefs associated with Taurus and its ruling planet Venus - love, beauty, and harmony.

3. Gemini - Ruled by Mercury - The Lovers
Gemini, an air sign, is characterized by communication, adaptability, and duality. The Lovers card represents union, decision-making, and relationships - themes closely tied to Gemini's dual nature and its ruling planet Mercury's focus on communication and exchange.

4. Cancer - Ruled by Moon - The Chariot
Cancer, a water sign, is marked by sensitivity, intuition, and nurturing. The Chariot card signifies determination, willpower, and emotional control – elements that can be traced back to Cancer's connection to the Moon, which governs emotions and intuition.

5. Leo - Ruled by Sun - Strength
Leo, a fire sign, symbolizes self-expression, courage, and creativity. The Strength card exemplifies the inner strength and conviction embodied by the passionate and enthusiastic nature of Leo and its ruling luminary, the Sun.

6. Virgo - Ruled by Mercury - The Hermit
Virgo, an earth sign, is defined by meticulousness, analysis, and practicality. The Hermit card signifies introspection, seeking wisdom, and guidance, echoing Virgo's analytical nature and its connection to Mercury, the planet of communication and learning.

7. Libra - Ruled by Venus - Justice
Libra, an air sign, epitomizes balance, harmony, and fairness. The Justice card is a clear representation of the attributes of Libra, as well as its connection to Venus, the planet of love and beauty, which brings forth the theme of equilibrium and harmony.

8. Scorpio - Ruled by Pluto and Mars - Death
Scorpio, a water sign, is associated with transformation, depth, and intensity. The Death card, often misunderstood, symbolizes change, transformation, and renewal – capturing the essence of Scorpio's transformative nature and its connection to Pluto, the planet of regeneration and Mars, which represents action and assertion.

9. Sagittarius - Ruled by Jupiter - Temperance
Sagittarius, a fire sign, is characterized by optimism, exploration, and philosophical pursuits. The Temperance card represents balance, moderation, and the blending of opposites – reflecting Sagittarius' quest for wisdom and its connection to Jupiter, the planet of expansion and growth.

10. Capricorn - Ruled by Saturn - The Devil
Capricorn, an earth sign, symbolizes ambition, discipline, and responsibility. The Devil card represents materialism, control, and temptation - lending insight into Capricorn's drive for success and its link to Saturn, the planet of limitations and lessons.

11. Aquarius - Ruled by Uranus and Saturn - The Star
Aquarius, an air sign, represents innovation, altruism, and progress. The Star card signifies hope, inspiration, and spiritual guidance – resonating with Aquarius' forward-looking nature and its connection to Uranus (innovation) and Saturn (structure).

12. Pisces - Ruled by Neptune and Jupiter - The Moon
Pisces, a water sign, is associated with compassion, imagination, and mysticism. The Moon card embodies intuition and the subconscious – corresponding to Pisces' deeply intuitive nature and its connection to Neptune, the planet of illusions and spirituality, and Jupiter, the planet of wisdom and growth.

In conclusion, by understanding the symbolic correspondences between the zodiac signs, ruling planets, and the Major Arcana cards, we are given a unique lens to understand and interpret an individual's astrological chart and personal journey.
