To effectively respond to this knowledge challenge, let's first start with a brief introduction to the key concepts: Giordano Bruno's cosmology, Hermeticism, and the nature of infinite universes. Then, we will analyze the connections and differences between these ideas, and finally, discuss the role of divine intellect in achieving enlightenment.

Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) was an Italian philosopher, mathematician, and friar who contributed significantly to the fields of cosmology and metaphysics. His ideas were considered revolutionary and controversial during his time, particularly his assertion that the universe was infinite and comprised of numerous inhabited worlds. This brought him into conflict with the Catholic Church, which eventually led to his execution.

Hermeticism is a philosophical system that traces its roots to the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, an ancient philosopher who synthesized Greek and Egyptian thought. The core principles of Hermeticism include the unity of all existence, the correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm, and the role of the divine intellect in the process of attaining self-knowledge and spiritual enlightenment.

Now that we have established the basics, let's explore the connections and differences between Bruno's cosmology and Hermeticism.

**Connections:**

1. **Unity of all existence**: Both Bruno's cosmology and Hermeticism share the belief in the interconnectedness of everything in the universe. For Bruno, the universe is a unified whole, bound together by a supreme force or divine intellect. This concept aligns with the Hermetic idea of the unity between the material and the spiritual, the heavens and the earth, and all creatures in existence.

2. **Correspondence between the microcosm and the macrocosm**: Bruno emphasized the idea that the structure and functioning of our world are a reflection of the larger cosmos. This idea is the essence of the Hermetic principle of "as above, so below," illustrating the interconnected nature of the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (individuals, societies, and nature on Earth).

3. **Role of divine intellect**: In both Bruno's cosmology and Hermeticism, acquiring true knowledge and wisdom is dependent on the divine intellect's influence. For Bruno, the divine intellect sets the cosmic order and provides the means to understand and access universal truths. Similarly, in Hermeticism, the divine intellect is instrumental in helping individuals connect with the higher realms of understanding.

**Differences:**

1. **Infinite universes**: While Hermeticism addresses the idea of a singular universe, Bruno expanded upon this notion and proposed the existence of infinite universes, each containing a multitude of worlds. This was a radical divergence from traditional cosmological ideas and placed him at odds with both the teachings of Hermeticism and the Catholic Church.

2. **Cosmological focus**: The emphasis in Hermeticism is primarily on the principles governing the cosmos and spiritual transformation. In comparison, Bruno's cosmology is more focused on the physical aspects, such as the structure of the universe and the plurality of worlds.

To demonstrate how these ideas contributed to Bruno's understanding of the nature of infinite universes and the role of divine intellect in achieving enlightenment, we can delve deeper into his key beliefs:

1. **The infinite nature of the universe**: Bruno's idea of multiple universes stemmed from the belief that the divine intellect is limitless. Since a finite creation would be an inadequate expression of such an omnipotent being, the universe has to be infinite, containing countless worlds across multiple dimensions.

2. **Enlightenment through divine intellect**: In accordance with Hermetic belief, Bruno posited that divine intellect enables individuals to attain self-knowledge and spiritual growth. By understanding the cosmos and its underlying principles, we can, in turn, discover our place in the universe and develop our intellectual capabilities, ultimately leading to enlightenment.

In conclusion, Giordano Bruno's cosmology shares essential elements with Hermeticism, such as the unity of existence, the correspondence between the macrocosm and microcosm, and the role of divine intellect in enlightenment. However, Bruno's concept of infinite universes distinguishes his ideas from traditional Hermeticism. By integrating these ideas, Bruno developed a unique understanding of the universe's nature and the role of divine intellect in achieving spiritual enlightenment.
