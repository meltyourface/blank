In order to address this knowledge challenge, I will examine the influences, methodologies, and work of three prominent occultists in history: Aleister Crowley, Eliphas Lévi, and Madame Blavatsky. By highlighting their contributions to Western esotericism, we can assess their impact on contemporary occult thought.

1. **Aleister Crowley (1875-1947)**:

**Influences and Methodologies**: Aleister Crowley is a significant figure in Western occultism due to his synthesis of numerous esoteric traditions into unique systems of magic. He was heavily influenced by Hermeticism, Kabbalah, Gnosticism, and Eastern mysticism. Crowley established the religion of Thelema, which advocates for the discovery and fulfillment of one's True Will or purpose in life. His primary methodology emphasized personal transformation through magical rituals, Yoga, and drug exploration.

**Impact on Western Esotericism**: Crowley's work has had a substantial influence on modern occultism. He integrated and reformulated various esoteric ideas and practices into a coherent system, thereby shaping Western esotericism as an expressive form of individualism rather than dogmatic religion. Additionally, he founded the secret society known as the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) that continues to impact the contemporary occult community.

2. **Eliphas Lévi (1810-1875)**:

**Influences and Methodologies**: Eliphas Lévi, born Alphonse-Louis Constant, was a French occultist who played a crucial role in popularizing esoteric knowledge in the West. Lévi was inspired by Kabbalistic and Hermetic traditions, as well as the prevailing Romantic and socialist ideas of his time. He emphasized the power of symbolism and the role of the imagination in magical work. His primary methodology relied on blending esoteric concepts from various sources, synthesizing them into a comprehensive system.

**Impact on Western Esotericism**: Lévi's reinterpretation and synthesis of various mystical traditions have marked a turning point in the history of Western occultism. His ideas, particularly regarding the Tarot and Baphomet symbolism, have become integral to esoteric thought. Furthermore, his work laid the groundwork for the occult revival of the 19th and 20th centuries, inspiring subsequent generations of occultists, including Aleister Crowley.

3. **Madame Blavatsky (1831-1891)**:

**Influences and Methodologies**: Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a Russian-born spiritualist and occultist, co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875. Blavatsky's work was rooted in her extensive travels and exposure to various mystical traditions from around the world. Her primary methodology depended on the synthesis of Eastern and Western esoteric ideas into a coherent system, which she called Theosophy. Blavatsky sought to reconcile science, religion, and philosophy through her work.

**Impact on Western Esotericism**: Blavatsky's teachings revolutionized Western occultism as she brought Eastern esoteric concepts to the forefront. Her comprehensive system of Theosophy, which includes ideas like karma, reincarnation, and spiritual evolution, has influenced various aspects of New Age spirituality. Furthermore, Blavatsky effectively bridged the gap between Eastern and Western esoteric thought, leaving a profound impact on contemporary occultism.

In conclusion, the works of Aleister Crowley, Eliphas Lévi, and Madame Blavatsky have undeniably shaped the course of Western esotericism. Their influences and methodologies, which were rooted in diverse mystical traditions, highlight their intersections and divergences. While Crowley focused on personal transformation through ritual and embracing one's True Will, Lévi emphasized the power of symbolism and the imagination. Blavatsky sought to bridge Eastern and Western mysticism in her teachings. The sociocultural contexts of their work also played a significant role in shaping their contributions to esotericism, leading to their enduring legacies as major influences on contemporary occult thought.
