1. Investigating the specific demons and entities associated with the Devil's crown:

The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis, is a grimoire from the 17th century containing detailed information on demonology. It is divided into five books, with the primary focus on the first book, the Ars Goetia. There are 72 demons and entities listed in the Ars Goetia. Although none are specifically labeled as part of the Devil's crown, certain demons appear to exhibit a higher level of influence and power, potentially serving as leaders or central figures in this elusive hierarchy. Notable examples include:

- King Beleth: Known to arrive with a powerful and cacophonous entourage, Beleth commands 85 legions of spirits. He is often associated with the force of love and desire, which can be both creative and destructive.

- Duke Bune: A ruler of 30 legions, Bune is sought for his ability to elevate one's status, wealth, and knowledge of the past and future.

- Earl Raum: Invoked for both thievery and the uncovering of truth, Raum rules over 30 legions and has the power to destroy entire cities and locations.

2. Analyzing connections between sigils and rituals in the grimoire:

Sigils and rituals within the Lesser Key of Solomon hold significant importance for summoning and controlling demons and entities, including those related to the Devil's crown. Specific instructions govern the creation of magical circles, seals, and invocations to ensure protection and control for the practitioner. Each demon is represented by its unique sigil, which is believed to contain an element of its essence or power. Furthermore, timing and planetary associations are emphasized, adding an additional layer of complexity to the performance of these rituals.

3. Exploring the influence of the Lesser Key of Solomon on Devil's crown practices within Western occultism:

The Lesser Key of Solomon has undeniably left a lasting impact on the broader landscape of Western occultism. Several occult systems, including Hermeticism, Thelema, and modern satanism, have drawn inspiration from or integrated aspects of the Lemegeton into their practices, shaping concepts of demonic hierarchies, invocation, and magical procedure. The Devil's crown, as an aggregate of demonic forces, can be seen as a syncretic product of various esoteric traditions and influences.

4. Examining historical or documented accounts of the grimoire's implementation in Devil's crown rituals:

There are numerous accounts, both historical and contemporary, of individuals attempting to employ the rituals and practices described in the Lesser Key of Solomon for various purposes. However, due to the secretive nature of these practices and their ethical implications, many accounts may remain undisclosed. Reports of possession, visions, and material gains are frequently cited as evidence of successful implementation, but skepticism and alternate explanations persist.

5. Contemplating potential modifications or adaptations to enhance the effectiveness of Devil's crown conjurations:

Considering the diverse functions and powers of individual demons and entities within the Devil's crown, adaptions that better align their abilities with the practitioner's intent could enhance ritual efficacy. Additionally, incorporating elements from other esoteric disciplines or traditions, such as astral projection or energy work, may prove synergistic in maximizing the potency of Devil's crown invocations.

In conclusion, this comprehensive esoteric analysis of the Lesser Key of Solomon, focusing on connections to the Devil's crown, has revealed intricate connections between the grimoire and evolving practices within Western occultism. To ensure a thorough understanding, further research and exploration into both primary and secondary sources, as well as experiential engagement with the practices, should be undertaken.
