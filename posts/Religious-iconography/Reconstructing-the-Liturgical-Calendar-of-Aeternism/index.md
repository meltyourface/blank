To reconstruct the detailed liturgical calendar of a long-forgotten faith, let us delve into the realm of ancient religious iconography using archaeological finds, related texts, and historical records to uncover sacred festival dates, notable rituals, spiritual significance, and associated symbols, imagery, and religious artifacts. For this exercise, we will explore the hypothetical faith of "Aeternism."

Aeternism was an ancient faith with polytheistic and nature-centric beliefs, it revered celestial alignments and cycles, venerating the eternal nature of existence and its interconnectedness. Its pantheon consisted of various deities representing the elemental and celestial aspects of the world.

Primary Deities:
1. Solvar, the Sun God - symbolized by an aureole or radiant disk.
2. Lunaria, the Moon Goddess - symbolized by a crescent moon, often depicted with a hare.
3. Terros, the Earth God - represented by an oak tree or mountain.
4. Aquaria, the Water Goddess - symbolized by a chalice or waterfall.
5. Ventur, the Air God - symbolized by a floating feather or a raptor in flight.
6. Ignisara, the Fire Goddess - depicted as an eternal flame or blazing star.

Using the extensive study of architectural structures, sculptural reliefs, pottery, paintings, manuscripts, and tools from various archaeological sites, dating back to approximately 1400 BCE, I have reconstructed the following liturgical calendar:

1. **Festival of Invictus Sol**: Celebrated on the Summer Solstice, this festival honored Solvar and his triumph over darkness, as the longest day of the year, this day marked an important shift in the celestial cycle. Iconography includes the sun disc, golden wreaths, and sunflowers.

2. **Festival of Lunar Blessings**: Observed on the first full moon of the year, Lunaria's festival celebrated fertility, renewal, and the beginning of the harvest cycle. Symbols include the crescent moon, hares, and bowls filled with water for reflections.

3. **Terranean Communion**: Coinciding with the Autumnal Equinox, Terros's festival involved a significant gathering of people offering their gratitude for the bounty of the Earth. Iconography includes oak leaves, acorns, and sheaves of wheat.

4. **Aquarian Confluence**: A mid-summer festival dedicated to Aquaria, this occasion involved ritualistic cleansing, water offerings, and the celebration of life-giving forces. Symbols include chalices, waterfall motifs, and water lilies.

5. **Festival of the Winds**: Observed in early spring, Ventur's celebration marked the time when the world would be stirred back to life after winter's slumber. Iconography includes feathers, wind chimes, and depictions of flying birds.

6. **Ignisian Revel**: Falling on the Winter Solstice, Ignisara's festival was a time of renewal, as the world metaphorically transitioned from darkness to light. Symbols include bonfires, torches, and the iconography of the eternal flame.

These six major festivals were pivotal in the Aeternist faith, each symbolizing a specific aspect of the eternal cycle of nature and the celestial alignments. Through meticulous research over artifacts, texts, and iconography, this liturgical calendar represents a comprehensive understanding of the long-lost Aeternist religious tradition.
