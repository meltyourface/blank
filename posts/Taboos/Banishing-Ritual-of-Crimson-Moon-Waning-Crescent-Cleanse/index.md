  Title: The Ritual of the Crimson Moon
  
  Ritual Overview:
  The Ritual of the Crimson Moon is a powerful banishing ritual designed to cleanse and dispel negative energies, malevolent entities, and lingering curses. This ritual combines elements from various forbidden traditions, invoking deities and spirits, utilizing rare ingredients, and employing potent symbolism.
  
  Preparation:
  This ritual is best performed during the waning crescent moon, when its energies are at their weakest, symbolizing the banishing of negativity. The ideal atmospheric condition should be a calm, starry night. Choose a remote location outdoors, preferably near a crossroads, known for its supernatural activity.
  
  Ingredients:
  1. A small vial of fresh blood from the person seeking cleansing (the subject) or, in the case of a cursed object, from the creature that bestowed the curse.
  2. Sacred herbs such as belladonna, wormwood, and henbane, gathered and bundled with a silver cord.
  3. Black candles, made from beeswax mixed with crushed black tourmaline, infused with the intent of protection and banishment during their creation.
  4. Enchanted amulet made of black salt-infused obsidian, inscribed with the Sigil of Banishing (a pentagram with a downward-facing crescent moon).
  5. A silver chalice filled with consecrated red wine.
  6. A sharp, ceremonial dagger.
  7. A parchment paper and black ink mixed with the ashes of ceremonial fires used in previous banishing rituals.
  
  Ritual Steps:
  1. Begin by setting up a sacred circle around the ritual area, marking it with a mixture of crushed black tourmaline and salt to create a protective barrier.
  2. Place the black candles at the cardinal points of the circle, north, east, south, and west, and light them while reciting the names of four banishing deities, such as Hecate, Kali, Set, and Morrigan.
  3. Conduct an invocation of these deities and any other protective spirits, asking for their guidance and aid in banishing the negative forces.
  4. Burn the bundle of sacred herbs and use the smoke to cleanse the subject or cursed object, along with the ritual area, allowing the negative energies to attach to the smoke and be dispelled.
  5. Carefully pour the vial of blood onto the parchment paper, using the ceremonial dagger to write the subject's name and birthdate, or the history of the cursed object, along with a detailed description of the negativity or entities to be banished.
  6. Fold the parchment three times and place it upon the Sigil of Banishing, reciting an incantation to bind the destructive forces to the parchment and sigil.
  7. Drip a few drops of blood on the enchanted amulet and have the subject wear it to create a strong protective barrier around them.
  8. Bury the parchment with the infused sigil in the center of the circle, sealing it with a mixture of black salt and soil.
  9. Fill the chalice with consecrated wine and raise it toward the waning crescent moon, asking the deities to bless the person or object with renewed strength and protection.
  10. Pour the wine upon the buried parchment, letting it soak into the ground, further sealing the banishment.
  11. Give thanks to the deities and spirits for their help and close the circle by extinguishing the black candles in reverse order.
  12. Break the circle by sweeping away the salt with a broom or staff, ensuring the barrier is entirely removed.
  
  The time taken for the effects of the ritual to manifest will vary from a few hours to several days, depending on the strength and nature of the negativity. To boost the power of the ritual, it can also be performed during notable astrological events, such as an eclipse or a planetary alignment.
  
  Caution:
  This ritual should not be taken lightly due to the inclusion of potent Taboo elements and deities. It is essential that it is performed with absolute dedication, respect, and precision to ensure the desired outcome and avoid any undesired consequences.
