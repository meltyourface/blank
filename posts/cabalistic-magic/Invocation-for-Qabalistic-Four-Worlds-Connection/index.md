  In the name of the boundless and eternal, I, a humble servant, beseech the powers of the Qabalistic Four Worlds to aid in the crafting of this sacred and divine invocation. Let the breath of Ain Soph Aur breathe life into my words, as the divine wisdom of the Tetragrammaton—Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh—unveils the mysteries of the universe.
  
  I cast the circle around me, encompassing all that is seen and unseen, and call upon the guardians of the four cardinal directions to bear witness to this invocation:
  
  From the North, I summon the world of Assiah, the realm of Earth and matter, home to all that is manifest and tangible. Beloved Archangel Uriel, ruler of Earth and the North, I beseech thee to empower this sacred space with your unwavering presence. Conjure forth the energies of the solid and grounding world of Assiah, and stand as the pillar of stability that supports this celestial communion. Behold the embedded sigil of Earth—a cube encircled in the heart of the Pentacle.
  
  From the East, I invoke the world of Yetzirah, the realm of Air and intellect, where thoughts and ideas are born and take flight. Esteemed Archangel Raphael, ruler of Air and the East, I call thee to raise up a tempest of wisdom and understanding within this hallowed ground. Let the winds of Yetzirah carry forth your divine essence, enveloping this space in a current of endless knowledge. Behold the embedded sigil of Air—the intangible Octahedron within the enveloping swirls of the all-encompassing storm.
  
  From the South, I call upon the world of Briah, the realm of Fire and creation, where the radiant spark of life begins its journey toward materialization. Mighty Archangel Michael, ruler of Fire and the South, I request that you illuminate this sacrosanct area with the incandescent brilliance of divine illumination. Ignite the world of Briah with the celestial fires of creation, bathing this sphere in the warm glow of your protective embrace. Behold the embedded sigil of Fire— the Tetrahedron aflame, at the heart of the blazing Solar Lotus.
  
  From the West, I beckon the world of Atziluth, the realm of Water and emotion, where the currents of intuition and spiritual connection flow freely. Gracious Archangel Gabriel, ruler of Water and the West, I ask thee to immerse this sanctified place in the depths of your boundless compassion and empathy. Bathe us in the nourishing waters of Atziluth, washing away all that hinders our path to understanding and enlightenment. Behold the embedded sigil of Water—the fluid Icosahedron, ensconced within the ever-shifting tides of the Mystic Moon.
  
  With the powers of the Four Worlds now gathered in this sacred space, I invoke the presence of the Tetragrammaton to connect, bind, and unify these divine energies. Yod, the emanation of life; Heh, the expansion of awareness; Vav, the revelation of knowledge; and Heh, the synthesis of wisdom.
  
  As the circle is now cast, divine wisdom may flow freely through the conduit of this invocation. In the name of the Divine, let the gates of the four cardinal directions be opened and the blessings of the Four Worlds and the Tetragrammaton be revealed. And when the time is right and the circle must once again be uncast, the gates shall be sealed, and all shall return to their celestial abodes, leaving only the echoes of their wisdom and guidance within our hearts. So let it be. Amen.
