excerpt: Craft a cabalistic magical charm utilizing esoteric sigils and enchanted materials, with the purpose of summoning the energies of wealth and prosperity to increase financial abundance. Specifically, employ an ancient Hebrew Kabbalistic formula, incorporating sacred symbols and planetary alignments, to empower the charm. To further enhance the complexity and efficacy of the charm, incorporate offerings to the spirits of fortune and conduct the ritual during a ceremonially significant lunar phase.

To craft this cabalistic magic charm for wealth and prosperity, we will first gather the necessary enchanted materials and set up the sacred space for the ritual. **The following materials will be required**:

1. A parchment made from the skin of a lamb, washed in hyssop water and anointed with frankincense oil
2. **A quill fashioned from the flight feather of a golden eagle**
3. A mixture of powdered gold, powdered silver, and small, precious stones (diamond, emerald, and sapphire)
4. A small wooden box made of cedar, crafted to hold the parchment and sealed with wax bearing the Key of Solomon

During a waxing moon, preferably on a Thursday (Jupiter’s day), when the planet is in Leo, the most favorable zodiac sign for attracting wealth, and the moon is trine to Jupiter, prepare to perform the ritual:

1. Begin by drawing a sacred circle around the workspace and consecrating the area with salt, water, air, and fire.

2. Place the parchment on an altar and light a candle anointed with frankincense oil and dressed in pure gold leaf flakes.

3. Call upon the spirits of fortune and prosperity, invoking the Hebrew Kabbalistic formula: "Tzaphkiel, Tzedekiel, Anaiel - Haniel ve Gerachiel" (Source of Angels: The Angels of Jupiter)

4. Upon the parchment, draw a sigil comprised of complex Kabbalistic symbols, including the symbols for Jupiter, the zodiac sign of Leo, and the names of the invoked spirits.

5. Write the sacred Hebrew phrase "פועל ישר, ומצליח בכל דרכיך" ("Act righteously, and you will succeed in all your ways.") around the sigil.

6. **Intone the sacred chant**: "Yah! Yod Hey Vav Hey! Tzedek, Tzaphkiel! VeShalom, Tzedekiel! Hohn VeGadol, Haniel! Etz ChaChaLillah, Gerachiel! Pesufathayim! Be Gadol VeTachanunim!"

7. As the chant is uttered, sprinkle the mixture of powdered gold, silver, and gemstones over the parchment, imbuing the sigil with their energy.

8. Offer each of the spirits a thimble full of pure olive oil and a coin of pure gold to ensure their aid in the ritual's success.

9. Thank the spirits, release them, and close the circle.

10. When everything has been completed, place the parchment in the cedar box and seal it with the wax bearing the Key of Solomon.

11. Place the cedar box containing the parchment in a safe space within your home or business. The charm will now radiate energies, summoning wealth and prosperity and increasing financial abundance for its owner.

12. To maintain the charm's potency, repeat the Hebrew chant once per week during the waxing moon phase.
