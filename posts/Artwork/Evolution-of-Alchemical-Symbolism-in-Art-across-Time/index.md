To thoroughly analyze the progression of alchemical symbolism in artwork across time from its origins in chemical pursuits to its manifestations in emblematic art during the Renaissance, we must first understand the complex tapestry of alchemical knowledge and practice. Alchemy, as both a philosophical and protoscientific tradition, has its roots in the Hellenistic Greco-Roman world, with a strong influence from Egyptian practices and knowledge. It would later spread to the Islamic world, and finally, into Europe, where it fully flourished during the 12th to 16th centuries. 

Throughout its history, alchemy has been deeply intertwined with religious, philosophical, and scientific developments. The main goals of alchemy are often regarded as transmutational, such as turning base metals like lead into noble metals like gold, and the discovery of an Elixir of Life that would grant the alchemist immortality. These pursuits, however, are merely the most visible aspects of a much deeper and more complex system that aims at the transformation of the alchemist's consciousness and understanding of the universe.

During the early stages of alchemical artwork, the symbols and themes were mostly borrowed from the corpus of existing religious and philosophical iconography, such as that of the alchemical cross and the intertwined serpent. These symbols often held dual meanings, both acting as literal representations of the chemical processes and as metaphors for spiritual transformation. For example, the ouroboros, a serpent devouring its tail, represents the cyclical nature of alchemical processes, the never-ending quest for knowledge, as well as the eternal cycle of death and rebirth in a spiritual sense.

As alchemy spread into the Islamic world, new symbols arose, and old ones began to transform. Islamic alchemy absorbed and synthesized Persian, Indian, and Chinese elements, thus enriching its symbolism and expanding its range of meanings. "The Philosopher's Stone," a key concept in alchemy, is a prime example of this synthesis. In Indian Alchemy, "Mercury" was believed to be the essential substance that could both unify and transform other metals. When this concept arose in the Islamic world, it evolved alongside a plethora of symbolism, including a cubic stone, symbolizing the wisdom to be discovered through these transformations.

During the European Renaissance, the scope and depth of alchemical symbolism in artwork increased, incorporating a vast array of new themes and ideas reflecting the rapidly changing cultural and intellectual climate. The integration of classical Greek and Latin texts, astrology, Kabbalah, and other spiritual practices led to a profound synthesis of knowledge, and this plurality of thought is reflected in alchemical artwork of the time. Emblematic art of this era, often consisting of images and texts, reveals an intricate pattern of interrelated, multi-layered meanings to be decoded and understood by the viewer. The Hermetic maxim "as above, so below" expresses this essence well: that the macrocosm and microcosm are connected, and that everything in the universe is interconnected and reflective of one another.

In conclusion, the progression of alchemical symbolism in artwork across time from its origins in chemical pursuits to its manifestations in emblematic art during the Renaissance represents a fascinating and complex journey, intimately linked with human cognitive and spiritual development. As the knowledge of alchemy spread from one culture to the next, so too did its symbolic language evolve and adapt, integrating the entire tapestry of human thought on religion, philosophy, and science. The symbols, hidden meanings, and transformations of these artforms serve as a testament to humanity's unceasing quest for understanding, and the deep-seated belief in the interconnectedness of all things.
