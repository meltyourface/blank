RR et AC was heavily influenced by the Golden Dawn, as many of the teachings were derived from the order's principles.

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (often abbreviated as "Golden Dawn") was a highly influential secret society that formed in the late 19th century, promoting the study and practice of the occult, metaphysics, and paranormal activities. RR et AC, an abbreviation for the Latin "Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis" or the Red Rose and Golden Cross, is a term that refers to the Second or Inner Order within the Golden Dawn, focused on more advanced spiritual work and initiation.

There are several reasons that explain how the Golden Dawn contributed to the development of modern Western esotericism and RR et AC in particular:

1. **Expanding Knowledge**: The Golden Dawn integrated teachings from a broad range of sources, including Hermeticism, Kabbalah, astrology, geomancy, alchemy, and more. This unique blend of ideas and practices drew greater interest and played an essential role in popularizing Western esotericism.

2. **Notable Members**: The Golden Dawn and its Inner Order RR et AC attracted a variety of well-known members, including writers and intellectuals such as William Butler Yeats, Aleister Crowley, and Arthur Edward Waite. These figures further contributed to the popularization of Western esotericism through their own works and teachings.

3. **System of Grades**: The structure of the Golden Dawn allowed for a clear progression of spiritual development. The Outer Order focused on basic teaching and initiation, while the Inner Order RR et AC took members who had completed the Outer Order curriculum through more intense spiritual, ritual, and magical work. This structured approach heavily influenced modern esoteric orders that adopt similar progression systems.

4. **Influence on future orders**: The Golden Dawn's teachings had a lasting impact on Western esotericism, as it influenced various offshoot organizations and movements. Some examples include the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), the Theosophical Society, and the Builders of the Adytum (BOTA), all of which have incorporated aspects of Golden Dawn teachings into their own practices.

In summary, the role of the Golden Dawn, including its Inner Order RR et AC, was instrumental in shaping modern Western esotericism. By synthesizing various teachings, attracting influential members and providing a structured system of spiritual development, the Golden Dawn left a lasting legacy that has influenced numerous orders and movements within the esoteric landscape.
