**Correlations with entities or forces**: Infernal Dragon's Blood has strong connections with dragons, fire elementals, and also Mars, the planet of war and aggression.

**Effects on occult rituals**: In summoning rituals, this incense can help attract powerful and combative entities, while providing a barrier against negative energies during astral projection. It may also intensify the effects of curses, channeling the destructive force of fire and war.

**Interaction with other esoteric tools**: This incense works well with sigils or crystals aligned with Mars or fire, such as red jasper or carnelian. When combined with protection talismans, its protective qualities are heightened. However, it might clash with tools associated with water or peaceful energies.

2. **Potent Midnight Graveyard Essence Incense**:

**Attributes**: This incense carries a dark, earthy, and mysterious energy, often associated with connecting to the underworld, spirits of the deceased, and shadow work.

**Correlations with entities or forces**: Midnight Graveyard Essence resonates with necromantic energies, ghosts, ancestral spirits, and the darker aspects of lunar magic.

**Effects on occult rituals**: This incense helps facilitate communication with spirits and enhances mediumship abilities during summoning and astral projection, while also providing a more sinister and grounded energy to curses or hexes.

**Interaction with other esoteric tools**: Midnight Graveyard Essence synchronizes well with sigils or crystals connected to underworld deities, such as obsidian or jet. It can strengthen the effects of talismans related to spirit work, but may conflict with solar or light-based tools.

3. **Enigmatic Serpent's Kiss Incense**:

**Attributes**: Serpent's Kiss incense holds an energy of seduction, transformation, and deep wisdom. It is often used in workings related to sexuality, regeneration, and knowledge.

**Correlations with entities or forces**: This incense is tied to serpent and reptilian entities, as well as deities associated with snakes, such as Lilith, Hekate, or Quetzalcoatl.

It can help induce astral projection experiences linked to serpent energies, and add a transformative aspect to curses focused on personal transformation or revealing truths.

**Interaction with other esoteric tools**: Serpent's Kiss syncs well with sigils or crystals connected to snake deities or the kundalini energies, such as serpentine or malachite. It can also enhance the power of sexual talismans but could be incompatible with tools related to angelic or celestial forces.
