The Ananta Prana Mukta technique is a powerful practice rooted in Indian spirituality for severing pranic connections and energy attachments while promoting chakra alignment, pranayama, and mantra chanting. This technique incorporates ancient symbols, mudras, and visualization exercises, and also provides methods to cleanse and protect the auric field after the process. 

Follow these steps to perform the Ananta Prana Mukta technique:

1. Preparation: Find a quiet, comfortable space where you can sit or lie down. Close your eyes and focus on your breath, inhaling and exhaling deeply and slowly.

2. Chakra Alignment: Visualize your seven primary chakras, starting from the root chakra (Muladhara) at the base of your spine and progressing upward through the sacral chakra (Swadhisthana), solar plexus chakra (Manipura), heart chakra (Anahata), throat chakra (Vishuddha), third-eye chakra (Ajna), and finally, the crown chakra (Sahasrara). As you visualize each chakra, imagine it glowing in its corresponding color and spinning freely.

3. Pranayama: Practice the alternate nostril breathing technique (Nadi Shodhana Pranayama). Close your right nostril with your right thumb and inhale through your left nostril. Pause for a few moments, then close your left nostril with your right ring finger and exhale through your right nostril. Inhale through your right nostril, pause, then close the right nostril and exhale through the left nostril. Repeat this process for several cycles.

4. Mantra Chanting: Chant the powerful ancient mantra "Om Kshama Mukti Ananta" 108 times. This mantra, which means "I invoke the eternal energy of release and forgiveness," serves to cut the ties of energy attachments and purifies the aura.

5. Mudra: Practice the Ananta Mukti Mudra, a hand gesture for severing energy attachments. Place the tips of your index fingers together, curving the remaining fingers away from the midline, touching the pad of the thumbs with your pinky fingers. Hold this mudra while chanting the mantra and visualizing the energy connections being severed.

6. Visualization: Envision the energy attachments like ropes tied to your chakras. As you chant the mantra and perform the mudra, imagine each rope being cut, one by one, by a gleaming sword of golden light. As each attachment is severed, visualize the chakra healing and returning to its optimal state.

7. Auric Protection: After all energy attachments have been severed, visualize a sphere of golden light surrounding your entire body. This sphere of light serves as a protective shield, preventing any negative energies or new attachments from entering your energy field.

8. Closing: Return your focus to your breath, taking several deep, cleansing breaths. Express gratitude to yourself and the universe for the release, forgiveness, and newfound freedom. Gently open your eyes and bring your awareness back to your surroundings.

By practicing the Ananta Prana Mukta technique diligently, you can effectively sever pranic connections, cleanse your aura, and protect your energy field while aligning your chakras and enhancing your overall well-being.
