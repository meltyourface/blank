In the Azoëtic tradition, an invocation to amplify one's inner strength and self-assurance can be created by combining elements from the Azoëtia grimoire, using sigils, and aligning the chant with the Draconian Current's arcane knowledge.

First, let's create the chant or invocation by choosing words and phrases that evoke confidence, courage, and inner strength. **Remember that the chant should be both powerful on its own and easy for the practitioner to remember and repeat**:

"Rise, serpent fire, empower my will
Vanquish my fears, my doubts still
In Draconian streams, my spirit's forge
With Azoëtic flames, I now emerge."

Now, incorporate the sigils from the Azoëtia grimoire that amplify personal power, wisdom, and fortitude. Suitable sigils include Vanæth (power), Usanin (wisdom), and Guabense (strength). Draw the sigils with intention, using ink or other materials charged with your energy.

Follow this process to align the invocation with sonic resonance:

1. Chose a melodic tone or hum that resonates with your personal power and unique energy.
2. While chanting or humming this tone, visualize yourself being filled with self-assurance and inner strength through Draconian Current energies.
3. As you recite the invocation, harmonize the tone with the cadence of the chant to create a vibration that embodies the desired goal.

Finally, incorporate the Draconian Current's arcane knowledge by meditating upon the essence of the Dragon:

1. Invoke the energies of Tiamat, the primeval chaos, and the primal serpent, Leviathan, as sources of great transformative power.
2. Embrace both the destructive and creative forces of the Dragon, forming a balance between the two to fortify your soul.

Perform the chant regularly, especially in times of doubt or uncertainty. With practice, your personal power will amplify, and you will project self-assurance and inner strength in all aspects of your life.
