Solomonic magic, named after the biblical King Solomon, refers to an extensive and varied tradition of Western magical practices that derives from the biblical account of Solomon as a master of wisdom and magic, capable of controlling and commanding spirits, particularly demons. It is a rich and complex lineage that spans multiple cultures and periods, with a great emphasis on Divine and angelic names as central to the practice.

The roots of Solomonic magic can be traced back to the ancient Near East, where stories of the wise king and his magic developed from various sources, such as Jewish, Christian, Arabic and Persian texts. Some of the key texts that outline and codify these practices include the Testament of Solomon, the Key of Solomon (Clavicula Salomonis), and the Lesser Key of Solomon (Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis). These works helped popularize Solomonic magical practices throughout the centuries.

Divine and angelic nomenclature is a central component of Solomonic magic. The practitioner's authority and power in rituals are derived from these names, drawn from biblical, apocryphal, and other esoteric sources. They are used to invoke the Divine presence, command spirits, and consecrate magical tools and ritual spaces. The names provided the magician with a bridge between the earthly and the celestial, allowing them to access the power of the Divine to influence reality.

One of the most iconic examples of the use of Divine and angelic names in Solomonic magic is the creation and use of the magic circle. The circle serves as a protected space for the magician, and is inscribed with the names of God, angels, and other protective symbols. It is a manifestation of the power dynamics inherent to this practice, where the magician channels the authority of celestial beings to command spirits.

Solomonic magical practices are also well-known for their use of grimoires, texts containing instructions, invocations, and other knowledge central to performing these rituals. These grimoires often include complex instructions for summoning and controlling various spirits, each requiring the use of specific Divine and angelic names as part of the ritual. One renowned ceremony is the "Ars Goetia," found in the Lesser Key of Solomon, which details the evocation of the 72 Goetic spirits, each of which is ruled by an angel's name. The magician would typically use this name to control and command the particular spirit.

Over time, Solomonic magical practices underwent significant evolution and adaptation, spreading through the Western world and influencing many esoteric and magical traditions. For instance, Renaissance scholars and magicians, such as Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and John Dee, were well-versed in Solomonic magic and used it as a foundation for the development of their own ceremonial practices and theories.

In modern esoteric disciplines, the influence of Solomonic magic can be seen in the practices and structure of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a late 19th-century secret society that, in many ways, laid the foundation for modern Western ceremonial magic. Members of the Golden Dawn built upon the Solomonic tradition, incorporating its teachings and practices into their elaborate system of initiation and spiritual development.

In conclusion, Solomonic magic is a complex and multifaceted tradition that has influenced countless practitioners and esoteric disciplines throughout history. The use of Divine and angelic names is central to the practice, enabling magicians to manifest their will through the invocation of celestial authorities. Its rich history and lasting influence make Solomonic magic a vital and fascinating aspect of the broader Western magical tradition.
