Entry 1: Experimentation

**Date**: July 14th

Today was... different. I tried cocaine for the first time. It all started at Steven's party. At first, I hesitated, but everyone was doing it, and I didn't want to feel left out. So, I took a deep breath and snorted that white powder. An electric feeling surged through my body.

It was... unreal. I felt this incredible energy, like I could do anything. I was talking faster, thinking clearer, and just feeling alive. I know cocaine is dangerous, but a part of me can't help but marvel at the power it gave me. I can see how people could get addicted to this feeling. But I wouldn't let myself go down that road, or so I thought.

Entry 2: Regular use

**Date**: September 2nd

I can't believe it, but my cocaine use has become more frequent. Instead of just using it at parties or social gatherings, I've started using it to get through the workday. At first, I thought it was helping me, keeping me focused and alert, but now, things are getting out of control.

I'm fighting with my family and friends and ignoring my responsibilities at work. I've almost been caught at work a couple of times, so my boss is starting to keep an eye on me. I don't want to lose everything because of this. But, I don't know if I can stop on my own. 

Entry 3: Risky use

**Date**: October 21st

My life is falling apart. I'm doing things I never thought I would do. I've stolen money from my family and friends. I've been in more physical altercations than I can count. I even drove under the influence last night, knowing full well the danger I was putting myself and others in. 

The guilt is overwhelming, but it doesn't seem to stick. I can't seem to care enough about my actions when I'm under the influence. I thought I could keep this under control, but I'm becoming someone I don't even recognize. I want to change, but the urge for more is so strong.

Entry 4: Dependence

**Date**: November 30th

I hate what I've become. I'm physically and mentally addicted to cocaine. My body craves it constantly, and the withdrawal symptoms are unbearable: headaches, nausea, depression, anxiety, and more.

I've tried to quit, but each time I only make it a day or two before caving in. The shame and guilt eat away at me constantly. I can see the pain in my loved ones' eyes, and I know they want to help, but I always push them away.

My body is a wreck. I'm constantly tired, my skin looks terrible, and I've lost so much weight. I'm always cold, but sweating at the same time. I need to change, but it feels so impossible.

Entry 5a: Recovery

**Date**: December 15th

After hitting rock bottom, I knew something had to change. I finally let my loved ones in and told them about my addiction. They were hurt, understandably so, but they wanted to help me get better. With their support, I checked myself into rehab.

I know the road to recovery will be a long and arduous one, but I must make amends and find my way back to who I used to be. I will rebuild my relationships, find healthy and constructive ways to cope with stress, and most importantly, work towards a life free from the shackles of addiction.

Entry 5b: Regression

**Date**: December 15th

I tried. I really did. I attended a few AA meetings, and I even managed to stay clean for a couple of weeks. But, one day, the cravings became too strong. I ran into my old dealer, and before I knew it, I had relapsed.

The guilt and shame are unbearable. I know I let everyone down, and I'm scared that they'll never trust me again. But as much as I want to quit, the grip of addiction is so powerful, and I'm slipping further into chaos and isolation.

I can only hope that one day I'll find the strength to escape this dark, imprisoning cycle, and reclaim my life. But right now, I fear that I'm lost.
