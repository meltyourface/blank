The effects of addiction on the spiritual practices and overall development of an individual are profound. Addiction distorts one's perception of reality, weakens the will, and obstructs the path to self-reformation. To better understand these consequences, it is helpful to analyze the teachings and perspectives of three major esoteric traditions, namely, Thelema, Kabbalah, and Hermeticism.

Firstly, let us examine the teachings and ideology of Thelema. Founded by Aleister Crowley, this spiritual path revolves around the principle that one should seek to discover and actualize their True Will. The True Will is an individual's highest purpose and potential, which, when pursued, leads to their spiritual growth and connection with the wider universe. Addiction can significantly hinder the development and discovery of one’s True Will by distorting the individual's sense of self and perception of reality. An addicted person may mistakenly believe that their addiction is part of their True Will, and even feed it, causing them to move further away from their genuine purpose. In this context, Thelema encourages the addict to recognize the dissonance between their compulsions and their True Will and provides avenues for self-analysis, introspection, and spiritual guidance, often through the practices of meditation and rituals.

Moving on to Kabbalah, an esoteric Jewish mysticism tradition that offers a metaphysical understanding of creation and the divine. At its core, Kabbalah seeks to help individuals attain a spiritual transformation known as "Devekut" or cleaving to God. The ten-dimensional Sephirot, the Tree of Life, represents the flow of divine energy and reflects stages of spiritual development. Addiction, in the context of Kabbalistic teachings, acts as an impediment to this spiritual growth. By maintaining a constant attachment to material desires, the addict remains trapped in the lower Sephirot, unable to ascend, leading to an inhibited spiritual connection to the divine. Kabbalistic teachings emphasize the importance of self-discipline, self-awareness, and spiritual exercises, such as prayer and meditation, in overcoming addiction and enhancing spiritual development.

The last tradition we will be examining is Hermeticism, which is based on the teachings and wisdom of Hermes Trismegistus. Hermeticism follows a set of philosophical and religious principles, which emphasize the pursuit of Gnosis – an intuitive knowledge of spiritual truth. The central tenet of Hermeticism is the axiom "As Above, So Below," signifying the underlying unity between the material and spiritual realms. In Hermetic thought, addiction is shown to hinder development and growth, as it traps an individual in the material realm, cutting them off from the spiritual plane. For initiates seeking self-reformation, Hermetic wisdom contains guidance for overcoming addiction through the practice of alchemy – a process of spiritual transmutation where the 'base' can be transformed into something 'higher.' Alchemical practices and meditations may serve as methods for turning negative impulses and addiction into a purer form of spiritual energy, enabling the initiate's ascent towards Gnosis.

In summary, the effects of addiction on the spiritual practices and overall development of individuals in Thelema, Kabbalah, and Hermeticism are profound and include distortion of perception, weakened will, and disconnection from the divine. To address addiction and support self-reformation, these traditions offer valuable insights, teachings, and methods, which help the individual reconnect with their True Will, ascend the Tree of Life or achieve Gnosis. By undertaking self-analysis, embracing spiritual exercises like meditation and prayer, and utilizing alchemy to transmute base desires into spiritual growth, the initiate can overcome addiction and walk the path of self-reformation.
