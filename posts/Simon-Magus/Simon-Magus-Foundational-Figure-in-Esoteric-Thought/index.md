To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, let's first understand the context behind the key figures and concepts. Simon Magus was a Samaritan magician and religious figure in early Christian times, who is sometimes considered the founder of Gnosticism. Gnosticism is a collection of religious and philosophical beliefs that emphasized the importance of gnosis, or inner knowledge, for personal salvation. Early Church heresies were beliefs or practices that deviated from orthodox Christian teachings, which threatened the unity and coherence of the burgeoning Christian Church. 

Now, let us begin by examining the three significant relationships between Simon Magus, Gnosticism, and early Church heresies. 

1. Simon Magus as a catalyst for Gnostic thought:
Simon Magus is often considered an early progenitor of Gnostic belief systems. His teachings—in part reflected in his primary text, the "Apophasis Megale" or "Great Declaration"—include complex cosmological concepts such as the existence of a Supreme God beyond the known universe, and doctrines exploring the relation between divine beings (known as aeons) and the material world. These ideas laid the groundwork for the dualistic notions found in later Gnostic movements, which posited a distinction between the material, evil world created by a flawed demiurge, and the spiritual realm of a transcendent, unknowable God. Simon's focus on self-discovery and the acquisition of hidden knowledge resonates with the Gnostic core principle of gnosis as the key to salvation.

To illustrate this relationship, imagine a tree—Simon Magus would be the seed from which the tree grew, while Gnosticism represents the branches that spread out from the trunk, creating diverse offshoots of the core belief system.

2. Simon Magus and the proto-orthodox response to heresy:
The association of Simon Magus with Gnostic thought led to his inclusion in early Christian heresiologies (listings of heretical teachings). His actions and beliefs, as depicted in the "Acts of the Apostles" and other early Christian writings, were seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the apostles and the teachings of Jesus. This animosity is exemplified in Simon's confrontation with Peter in the "Acts of the Apostles" (8:9-24), where Simon attempts to buy the power of the Holy Spirit, believing it to be a supernatural force that could be controlled—a practice later known as Simony.

To understand how this fueled the development of early Church heresies, consider a process of purification: impure substances like heretical beliefs are identified, isolated, and filtered out, strengthening the remaining Orthodox Church in an effort to create a pure, unified faith.

3. Simon Magus as an enduring figure in occultism and mysticism:
Given his identification as the founder of Gnosticism and his place in early Christian heresies, Simon Magus served as an iconic figure in subsequent occult and mystical traditions. His quest for hidden knowledge and the manipulation of supernatural forces, as evidenced by his alleged magical abilities (like flying), made him an archetype for magical practitioners seeking power through esoteric knowledge. This allowed his legacy to endure and evolve over time, as elements of Simonian and Gnostic thought became integrated into various magical, mystical, and religious movements throughout history.

To conceive of this impact, think of a handprint left in clay, which retains its shape even after the clay has hardened. Simon Magus has left an indelible mark on the history of the occult, mysticism, and esoteric thought, shaping the development of these areas up to the present day.

In conclusion, there are three primary connections between Simon Magus, Gnosticism, and the rise of early Church heresies:

1. Simon Magus was a formative influence on Gnostic beliefs, laying the groundwork for the movement's core tenets.
2. Simon's challenges to the fledgling Christian Church and his association with Gnosticism resulted in his inclusion in early heresiologies and the subsequent shaping of orthodox Christianity.
3. Through his legacy as a magician and religious figure, Simon Magus became an enduring and influential archetype within the sphere of occultism and mysticism.

These relationships highlight the far-reaching role of Simon Magus in the domain of esoteric and religious thought, establishing him as a key figure in the development of Western mysticism, with lasting effects on both Gnosticism and the formation of the early Christian Church.
