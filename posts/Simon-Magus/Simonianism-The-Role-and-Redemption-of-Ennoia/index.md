The Simonians were a religious group that emerged in the 2nd century CE, with origins rooted in the teachings of Simon Magus, a Samaritan mystic and magician who was contemporary to the rise of Christianity. Central to the Simonian belief system was the concept of Ennoia, which can be understood as the "first thought" or "universal mind." This idea had already been in circulation within various Gnostic and Neoplatonic circles; however, the Simonians held a distinct interpretation of Ennoia, which is worth examining in relation to Simon Magus, the origins of Simonianism, and its esoteric aspects.

In the Simonian ideology, Ennoia was considered a divine being who originated directly from the Supreme God. She was described as the "Mother of All" and the "Eternal Thought," and she played a crucial role in the creation of the cosmos. The Simonians believed that Ennoia's fall into the material world led to the emergence of evil and, thus, the need for redemption.

Simon Magus was seen, in the eyes of his followers, as the manifestation of the Great Power (or Megale Dynamis), which was the force behind the creation of the universe and its continued existence. According to Simonian thought, Simon Magus's mission was to restore Ennoia to her rightful place within the divine realms, enabling the salvation of humankind and the ultimate dissolution of the material world.

To further understand the significance of Ennoia and the Simonians, we can analyze primary source texts, such as the pseudo-Clementine literature and the writings of early Church fathers like Hippolytus and Irenaeus. These sources offer valuable insights into the beliefs and practices of the Simonians and their perspectives on Ennoia.

The pseudo-Clementine literature, particularly the Recognitions and the Homilies, depicts Simon Magus as a sorcerer and heretic who sought to deceive others with his teachings on Ennoia. This portrayal is likely influenced by the Christian theological perspective that regarded Simon Magus as an anti-Christian figure. On the other hand, the writings of Irenaeus and Hippolytus provide information about the central doctrines of Simonianism, which demonstrate the unique Simonian understanding of Ennoia.

The Simonians' view of Ennoia can be contrasted with other contemporary doctrines or perspectives within the occult and Gnostic traditions. In the Valentinian Gnostic system, for example, the concept of Ennoia played a similar role as the origin of all things but was considered to be a feminine aspect of the divine emanations. While there are apparent similarities, the Valentinian interpretation does not assign Ennoia the same soteriological importance as the Simonians.

Moreover, within the Neoplatonic thought of philosopher Plotinus, Ennoia appears as "Nous," which is the highest level of the World Soul or divine intellect. While it shares the idea of origin and generating force, the Neoplatonic conception is far more abstract and philosophical when compared to the highly religious and cosmological significance of the Simonian Ennoia.

In conclusion, the Simonian interpretation of Ennoia is deeply rooted in their belief system, with Simon Magus considered the divine redeemer whose mission was to restore Ennoia to her rightful place. Examining primary sources allows us to gain a clearer understanding of the unique Simonian perspective on Ennoia, which stands in contrast to other occult or Gnostic beliefs of the time. While the movement did not survive much beyond the second or third centuries, the concept of Ennoia and its role in the broader esoteric landscape remains an intriguing topic.
