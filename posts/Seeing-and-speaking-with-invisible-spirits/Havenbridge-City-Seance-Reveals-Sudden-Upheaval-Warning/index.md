[9:00 PM] Commencement of the seance.

Alice: I call upon the spirits of the ethereal realm to join us this evening. We request your guidance, wisdom, and insight. Please, let your presence be known to us.

[9:03 PM] The planchette on the Ouija board starts moving, spelling out "H-E-L-L-O."

Alice: (Acknowledging the spirit) Welcome, spirit. May I ask who you are?

[9:05 PM] The spirit spells out "A-N-D-R-E-W" on the Ouija board.

Bob: Andrew, if you can indeed hear us and communicate with us, what message do you have for us tonight?

[9:08 PM] The Tarot cards on the table shuffle mysteriously. A card is revealed—the Tower. 

Alice: (Addresses everyone) The Tower card signifies sudden upheaval and chaos. Andrew may be trying to tell us that there's a challenging time ahead.

Claire: Andrew, could you please give us more information on what we should expect?

[9:10 PM] Andrew uses the pendulum to indicate "yes." The pendulum swings vigorously in a figure-eight motion over a map laid on the table, indicating a specific location—it centers above a city named "Havenbridge."

Alice: It seems that the city of Havenbridge is connected to this message. Are there any additional symbols or warnings you would like to convey, Andrew?

[9:12 PM] The room gets colder, and the incense smoke forms the symbol of the Eye of Horus.

Diana: (Whispers) What does the Eye of Horus mean?

Alice: It represents protection, good health, and royal power—often used as a symbol of safety, warding off evil. Andrew may be letting us know that despite the upheaval, we have an opportunity to protect and strengthen ourselves.

Alice: Andrew, thank you for the messages you've shared tonight. Is there anything else you'd like to communicate before we end the session?

[9:15 PM] The planchette on the Ouija board moves to "GOODBYE."

Alice: (Concluding the seance) Spirits of the ethereal realm, we thank you for your presence and wisdom tonight. As we close this circle, we ask for your continued guidance and protection. Thank you, and farewell.

[9:16 PM] End of the seance communication session.
