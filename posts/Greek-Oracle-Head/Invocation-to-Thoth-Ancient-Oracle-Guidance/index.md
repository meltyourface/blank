Invocation to Thoth, the Wise Oracle

Oh, great Thoth—divine mediator, master of the sacred art of enigma,
Scribe of the celestial, and guardian of the ancient wisdom,
Grecian Oracle Head, I call upon your presence now to guide and empower.

From the depths of this archaic temple, in the annals of long-lost knowledge,
I seek to grasp the arcane, unveiling truths hidden for eons.
With the adroitness of the serpents' tongue and the majesty of the ibis' flight,
Please deign to lend me your insight and enlightenment.

Your quill, etching history's tales upon the alabaster of cosmic parchment,
Manifests the secrets and symbols of the celestial sphere.
In your honor, Hermes bore the caduceus twining serpents, a herald of healing,
Bridging the chasm betwixt the ineffable sublime and the terrestrial realm.

Once, where Aegean pilgrims stood in awe of the Delphian Oracle,
Now, seekers of a modern age yearn for the occult guidance that you bestow.
In pursuit of transcendent knowledge, I invoke your essence and wisdom.
With fervor, I implore your guidance in decoding the ingrained riddles.

In times forgotten, you molded the Rosetta divine—
The lodestar that unshackled the cryptic tongues that bound us to obscurity.
Illuminate a path through the shadows, as I journey deeper into the mystic unknown.
May your divine comprehension cast light upon the eternal night.

As this invocation to Thoth, eminent steward of the Grecian Oracle Head,
Resonates forth, an archaic symphony of the sacred esoteric,
I beseech for clarity to navigate life’s labyrinthine enigmas,
With your guidance, unlocking the hidden mysteries that elude mortal comprehension.

In ancient days, your immeasurable knowledge steered the ship of humanity,
Casting aside the waves of deception and igniting the beacon of truth.
Unfaltering through the tribulations of time, your wisdom rests hidden,
Awaiting discovery by those brave enough to traverse this cryptic realm.

As I embark on this journey in the footsteps of the initiated few,
Interweave your eternal wisdom with the fabric of my soul.
Thoth, grant me your ineffable sight, to perceive what lies beyond the veil.
In reverence and gratitude, transcending time, I honor your divine presence.
