1. **Origins of Ophite Gnosticism**
- Emergence in the 2nd century CE
- Primary tenets:
  - Reverence for the serpent (Ophis/Naas) as the embodiment of wisdom and a symbol of enlightenment
  - Belief in Sophia (wisdom) as a divine figure responsible for the creation of the material world and the Demiurge (Yaldabaoth) – an inferior god who rules over the material realm
  - Emphasis on the dualistic battle between the Demiurge and the serpent, with human souls trapped in the material world striving for gnosis (knowledge) to break free and return to the divine realm of the Pleroma (fullness)

2. **Key Ophite Gnostic texts and scriptures**
- Secret Book of John (Apocryphon of John) – early 2nd to mid-3rd century CE: elaborates on the creation myth, the role of Sophia and the Demiurge
- Pistis Sophia – 3rd to 4th century CE: Gnostic text exploring cosmology, the fall of Sophia, and redemption through knowledge
- Hypostasis of the Archons ("Reality of the Rulers") – mid-3rd century CE: a Sethian Gnostic text explaining the origin of evil, the creation of the material world, and the role of the serpent as an agent of wisdom

3. **Prominent Ophite Gnostic figures**
- Valentinus (100-160 CE): influential Gnostic theologian and founder of Valentinian Gnosticism; developed an intricate cosmology to offer a more detailed explanation of how the Pleroma functions
- Sethian: a term referring to a subset of Gnostic sects that revered the biblical Seth, who they believed to be a divine figure; these sects include the Ophite Gnostics, the Barbeloites, and the Archontics
- Basilides (2nd century CE): an early Gnostic teacher in Alexandria; taught a similar creation myth and revered the serpent, but disagreed on how human salvation might be achieved; his teachings led to the development of Basilidian Gnosticism

4. **Relationship with other Gnostic sects and religious movements**
- Convergence: Ophites, Sethians, and other Gnostic sects shared a similar cosmology based on dualism, the Demiurge, and the need for gnosis in order to escape the material realm
- Divergence: differences in focus on specific divine figures (e.g., Valentinian Gnosticism and the role of the emanations of the Pleroma, Basilidian Gnosticism and the figure of the "Great Nous")
- Persecution and suppression: early Christian church leaders (e.g., Irenaeus of Lyon, Hippolytus of Rome) condemned Gnostic sects, including the Ophites, as heretical
- Appropriation: integration of Gnostic themes and symbols into Christian art and literature, with many Gnostic texts eventually becoming part of the Nag Hammadi library discovered in 1945

5. **Enduring legacy and resurgence of Ophite Gnosticism**
- Modern-day spiritual practices: parallels found in Kundalini yoga, Kabbalah, Theosophy, and New Age beliefs
- Esoteric thought: influence on various occult, mystical, and philosophical movements, including Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and Western esotericism
- Arts: Gnostic themes incorporated into literature (e.g., William Blake, Philip K. Dick), visual art, and film (e.g., "The Matrix")
