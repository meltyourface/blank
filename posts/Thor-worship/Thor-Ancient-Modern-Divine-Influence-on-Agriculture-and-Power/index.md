  Answer:
  
  Introduction:
  The challenge posed requires an exploration of the interconnectivity between Thor's roles as the god of thunder, fertility, and protection in Norse mythology, as well as an analysis of how these aspects influenced the socio-political and agricultural practices of both ancient and modern Thor worshipers. This response will further delve into the multi-faceted understanding of Thor's attributes and how they reflect the complexity of the human relationship with natural and supernatural forces.
  
  Thor's Role as the God of Thunder, Fertility, and Protection:
  In Norse mythology, Thor is known as the god of thunder and embodies the aspects of fertility and protection due to his role as the guardian of the gods and mankind. His hammer, Mjolnir, is a symbol of both fertility and destructive power, becoming the source of his link to natural phenomena such as storms and rain. Thor's role as a fertility god stems from his ability to bless and protect crops, influence weather patterns, and guard against negative forces. This aspect of Thor's divinity has made him particularly important to agrarian societies who relied on his blessings for successful agricultural endeavors.
  
  Influence on Socio-Political and Agricultural Practices:
  The widespread worship of Thor and the importance attributed to his roles shaped the socio-political and agricultural practices of ancient Nordic societies, where farmers sought his aid for bountiful harvests and protection from hostile forces. Thor's image, often depicted as a fierce warrior wielding Mjolnir, was invoked to bless and protect farms, livestock, and crops, and his status as a symbol of strength and reliability influenced Nordic law and governance, with rulers and chieftains invoking his name and image as a symbol of authority and power.
  
  In modern Thor worship, adherents continue to pay homage to his protective and fertility-based aspects. Currently, various groups and individuals, particularly in the neopagan and heathen communities, actively engage in ceremonies and rituals to honor Thor and seek his blessings for protection and fertility. Farmers might also call upon Thor's assistance in ensuring successful agricultural endeavors, drawing a connection between ancient and modern worshipers in their understanding of Thor's importance to their livelihood and practices.
  
  Reflection on the Complexity of Human Relationships with Natural and Supernatural Forces:
  Thor's multi-faceted roles emphasize the intersection of natural and supernatural forces in the human experience, particularly as it relates to agrarian societies. His association with thunder, fertility, and protection showcases the intricate ways in which humans have sought to understand and engage with forces they perceive as beyond their control, and the need to establish relationships with divine entities so as to gain a sense of agency and assurance in the face of unpredictable and often hostile natural forces.
  
  Through the worship and association of deities such as Thor with natural phenomena, humans have found ways to contextualize and mitigate their fears, channeling them into religious practices and rituals that provide a sense of trust and control over the precarious balance of their lives. Furthermore, the complex nature of Thor's attributes underscores the nuances and contradictions inherent in the human relationship with the divine, as they seek to both harness and respect the destructive and life-giving powers of these entities in order to achieve a sense of harmony and balance in their lives.
  
  Conclusion:
  In summary, the intricate interconnectivity between Thor's roles as the god of thunder, fertility, and protection highlights the complex interactions humans have with natural and supernatural forces, as they attempt to navigate the uncertainties and complexities of their environment. By invoking Thor in agricultural practices and socio-political contexts, both ancient and modern worshipers demonstrate a continued intertwining of religious belief and lived experience that reflects a wider understanding of human relationships with the divine. Thor's multiple roles exemplify the complexities and contradictions that define the human experience and our interactions with the forces we deem to be beyond our immediate control.
