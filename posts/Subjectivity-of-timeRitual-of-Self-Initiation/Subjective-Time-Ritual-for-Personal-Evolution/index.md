Answering the knowledge challenge:

To devise a sequence of practices for a Subjectivity of Time Ritual for Self-Initiation that utilizes the principles of time dilation, circular time, subjective experiences and synchronicities, and culminates in a transformative moment of self-discovery, I would structure the ritual in the following steps:

1. Preparation and Setting Intentions:
Begin the ritual by spending time in deep contemplation and meditation to explore one's inner workings, desires, and goals for personal growth. Set an intention for the ritual, focusing on experiences that feel meaningful and relevant to one's current stage of life or spiritual journey. This intention should align with the overall theme of time and its principles.

2. Time Dilation Practice:
Introduce time dilation practices to alter one's perception of the passage of time. Techniques may include practices such as entering a deep meditative state or engaging in hours of extended, mindful, repetitive tasks— such as creating intricate mandalas, tending to a garden, or writing one's thoughts in a journal— where one's perception of time seems to stretch and expand.

3. Circular Time Meditation:
Integrate the concept of circular time by meditating on the cyclical nature of existence. Contemplate the interconnection between the past, present, and future, emphasizing that all moments within are simultaneously essential to one's journey. This meditation may be guided or self-directed, allowing the individual to explore their own experiences of circular time.

4. Subjective Experiences:
Implement practices that delve into the individual's subjective experiences, examining how personal histories, emotions, and beliefs impact one's perception of time. This may be facilitated through journaling, art, or verbal expressions, uncovering patterns and themes that connect life events and shape the unique narrative of one's experiences.

5. Synchronicities:
Cultivate an awareness of synchronicities and explore their significance throughout the process. Encourage the individual to seek moments of meaningful coincidences and, when identified, interpret their significance within the context of personal growth and the subjectivity of time ritual.

6. Integration and Transformation:
Finally, bring the individual through an immersive and transformative moment of self-discovery by integrating the gained insights from the previous steps. This may occur through physical movement, breathwork, visualization, or a combination of these practices. Encourage the individual to anchor their newly acquired knowledge, emotions, and realizations into a single, cohesive understanding of their relationship with time and personal evolution.

7. Closing and Reflection:
Close the ritual by reflecting on the journey and newly acquired insights, solidifying the wisdom gained. Consider writing or discussing the overall experience, and revisit personal intentions set at the beginning. Above all, ensure that the individual is left with a profound sense of personal growth and progress within the vast realm of the esoteric.

In summary, a Subjectivity of Time Ritual for Self-Initiation that simultaneously utilizes the principles of time dilation, circular time, subjective experiences and synchronicities, culminating in a transformative moment of self-discovery, requires thoughtful preparation, intention-setting, guided practices, and integration, ultimately leading to profound personal experiences and solidification of esoteric wisdom.
