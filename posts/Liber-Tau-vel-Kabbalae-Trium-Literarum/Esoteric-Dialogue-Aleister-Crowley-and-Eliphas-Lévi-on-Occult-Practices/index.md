## A Meeting of Esoteric Minds - Aleister Crowley and Eliphas Lévi

**Scene**: A dimly lit room with wooden table.

Aleister Crowley (AC): Ah, Lévi, it is an honour to meet a fellow occultist of your calibre.

Eliphas Lévi (EL): Likewise, Mr. Crowley. We may walk different paths, but our destination is the same – to uncover the mysteries of existence by delving into the realm of occult knowledge.

**AC**: Indeed, Lévi, let us discuss our methodologies and influences, starting with our approach to the esoteric practices of Liber Tau vel Kabbalae Trium Literarum. As a Thelemite, I follow the principle of "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," embracing true will and individual liberty.

**EL**: For me, as a Kabbalist and practitioner of the magical arts, my focus remains on the Tree of Life and its ten Sephiroth. My approach stems from understanding the nature and power of symbols, thereby connecting to the Divine.

**AC**: Our paths indeed differ, but I do appreciate the Tree of Life's significance, as expressed in Liber Trigrammaton, which fuses key insights from Eastern mysticism with the essence of Hermetic Qabalah.

**EL**: I see. And how do you apply the principles of Liber Tau vel Kabbalae Trium Literarum to interpret the Divine?

**AC**: It begins with the trinity – Creation, Formation, and Transmutation. In Liber Trigrammaton, the 27 trigrams represent a means of decoding hidden truths in the universe by understanding the permutations of these three elements.

**EL**: Fascinating. In my studies of the Tarot, I find a similar trinity – the Major, Minor, and Court cards echoing the triad of Creation (Major), Formation (Minor), and Transmutation (Court). With the Tarot, I seek revelation through interpreting the symbols and finding balance between intellect and emotion.

**AC**: Tarot's deep symbolism resonates with me as well. For instance, the A∴A∴, my magical order, placed great importance on the Tarot's structure, attributing the 22 trumps to the 22 paths of the Tree of Life.

**EL**: And how would you approach a divergent practice, like the astral projection or the summoning of entities?

**AC**: Utilizing specific techniques found in the domain of Liber Tau vel Kabbalae Trium Literarum, I develop rituals, like the Bornless Ritual for invoking the Higher Guardian Angel or the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram for clearing energies. A clear intention and true will set the stage for effective invocation or banishing.

**EL**: In my works, such as Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, I emphasize the importance of one's own spiritual and intellectual development, the balancing of the four elements, and the usage of ritual tools like the wand, cup, sword, and pentacle.

**AC**: While our philosophies have distinctive roots, we share a reverence for balance, the power of symbols, and the importance of self-actualization.

**EL**: We also share a commitment to exploring the mysteries of existence through the occult sciences and practices, searching for universal truths and forces.

**AC**: Indeed, Lévi, our meeting has shown that the thirst for understanding transcends time, space, and tradition.

**EL**: May the paths we walk continue to shed light on the known and unknown, Crowley, as we both strive to fulfil our destinies.
