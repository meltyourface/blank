A significant life event that many people experience is the death of a close loved one, such as a parent or grandparent. The event itself can involve multiple layers of meaning when viewed through the lens of the esoteric, occult, and Lesser Lotuses.

Firstly, it's essential to understand the fundamental concept of the Lesser Lotuses teachings. The Lesser Lotuses consist of various spiritual practices, rituals, and beliefs that mainly revolve around the life force energy (prana or chi) and how it interconnects individuals and the universe. This unique life force flows through specific channels, referred to as the lesser lotus points or chakras.

When analyzing the death of a loved one from the perspective of the Lesser Lotuses, the event may be seen as an encounter with the Great Mystery – the eternal cosmic force that is present in both life and death. The death of a close family member might be taken as a reminder of one's own mortality and of the fleeting nature of life – a theme present in the teaching of the impermanence of this physical plane.

One of the primary symbols related to this life event is the transition from the physical realm to the astral one, often represented by the imagery of a soaring bird or a serpent shedding its skin. The Lesser Lotuses doctrine acknowledges the ongoing cycle of life, death, and rebirth. As such, the deceased loved one is seen as being released from their earthly vessel, enabling their life force energy to return to the cosmic consciousness, where it might then be reborn in a different form.

The rites and practices of the Lesser Lotuses that may be connected to this event would likely include ancestral reverence, mediumship, and practices focused on guiding the deceased's spirit to a higher plane of existence. For example, adepts of the Lesser Lotuses may perform specific chants and prayers to help the soul of the deceased transcend the physical world and attain union with the cosmic consciousness.

In the case of mediumship, some practitioners of the Lesser Lotuses might attempt to communicate with the spirit of the deceased to gain insights, wisdom, or closure. This practice is often prevalent in cultures that emphasize the importance of maintaining strong connections with one's ancestors and tapping into their guidance even after their death.

The impact of this significant life event on the individual's spiritual journey is profound. Losing a loved one can serve as a catalyst for a deeper exploration of one's spirituality and foster a search for meaning that lies beyond the physical world's limits. It may also encourage the individual to strengthen their practice of the Lesser Lotuses, harmonizing their life force energy and spiritual awareness.

In conclusion, the death of a close loved one, seen through the lens of the Lesser Lotuses, can shed light on the interconnectedness of all beings, the transient nature of life, and the eternal cycle of renewal. The rites and practices associated with this event serve to guide the soul of the deceased toward a higher plane of existence and offer solace and wisdom to those left behind. This event thus plays a formative role in shaping the individual's spiritual journey, opening up new avenues of growth, understanding, and connection with the universe's more profound mysteries.
