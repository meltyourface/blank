Answer: He portrays the willow trees as sentient beings, influencing the characters' thoughts and emotions as they interact with them.

**Explanation**: In "The Willows," Algernon Blackwood utilizes elements of the occult and the profound connection between nature and spiritual awakening primarily through the portrayal of willow trees as sentient beings. These trees have a presence that influences the emotions, thoughts, and experiences of the characters as they venture further into a remote and desolate wilderness.

The willows in the story serve as symbolic agents through which Blackwood examines the deep-rooted relationship between humanity and the natural world. The characters come to realize that the willows are not just ordinary trees, but beings with a palpable life force that affects their psychological state as well as the events that unfold around them. 

While the use of sentient trees as a thematic element may not directly tie into specific occult practices or beliefs, the concept of nature possessing conscious intelligence can be related to the broader theme of animism, which is the belief that plants, animals, and even inanimate objects possess spiritual essence. This widespread spiritual perspective is found in numerous indigenous traditions and ancient religions.

In the context of the story, the omnipresent willows become a kind of supernatural force that challenges and unsettles the characters. This, in turn, pushes them to confront their fears, existential angst, and the limits of their own understanding and perception of reality. This journey of self-discovery results in a profound spiritual awakening placing them in contact with the mysteries of nature.

In sum, "The Willows" incorporates elements of the occult and spiritual awakening by personifying willow trees as sentient, powerful, and highly influential forces within the narrative. This enhances the notion that nature holds the capacity not only to stimulate our emotions but also to awaken our spiritual awareness and illuminate the deepest recesses of the human soul.
