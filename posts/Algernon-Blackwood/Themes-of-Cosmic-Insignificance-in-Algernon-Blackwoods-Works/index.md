Answer: An overwhelming sense of cosmic insignificance

**Explanation**: Algernon Blackwood was an English author who is best known for his ghost stories and supernatural fiction. In his works, a recurring theme that frequently affects the characters' understanding of reality is an overwhelming sense of cosmic insignificance.

Blackwood's approach to the occult and supernatural in his literary works primarily revolved around invoking a sense of awe, terror, and humility in the face of vast, powerful, and often unknowable forces of nature or the supernatural. This theme of cosmic insignificance reflects humanity's small and often powerless position in the vast cosmos of existence.

One key aspect of this theme is the notion that human beings have limited knowledge and experience of the full range of reality. Blackwood's characters often encounter terrifying supernatural experiences and are made to question their own sanity as well as the nature of their perceived reality. This idea is founded upon the concept that the world we see and experience is but a fragment of a much more complex and vast existence.

Blackwood also drew inspiration from philosophical and religious perspectives, such as the writings of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and Eastern mysticism. These perspectives affirm the idea that there is a deeper, more profound reality beyond the human perception of time and space.

Some well-known examples of Blackwood's works illustrating this theme are "The Willows" and "The Wendigo." In both stories, the protagonists find themselves amid powerful, nearly incomprehensible supernatural forces that challenge their sanity, safety, and understanding of the world. In "The Willows," the characters are stranded on an island surrounded by willows, where they are subjected to the enigmatic powers at play that seem to threaten the fabric of reality itself. Similarly, in "The Wendigo," the characters encounter a monstrous entity in the Canadian wilderness that emanates a powerful sense of otherworldliness and challenges their understanding of the natural world.

In conclusion, the recurring theme in Algernon Blackwood's approach to the occult in his literary works is an overwhelming sense of cosmic insignificance. This theme emphasizes humanity's limited knowledge and understanding of the cosmos while highlighting the vast, powerful, and often unknowable forces present in the supernatural and natural world. Through his works, Blackwood invited readers to contemplate the fragility and uncertainty of human perception and understanding, thereby eliciting a sense of awe, terror, and transcendental reverence for the unknown.
