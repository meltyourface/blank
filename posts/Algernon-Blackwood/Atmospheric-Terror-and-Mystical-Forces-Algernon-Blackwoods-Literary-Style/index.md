Answer: Blackwood often uses an atmospheric tone and emphasis on the psychological experience of the characters to create a sense of awe and terror, as they delve into the mysteries of the natural world.

**Explanation**: Algernon Blackwood, a British writer, is renowned for his extensive exploration of the occult and the supernatural in his works of fiction. His unique approach to combining these mystical elements with an emphasis on the mysterious forces of nature can be best described using the third option, where his stories employ atmospheric tones and character psychology to evoke feelings of awe and terror.

Blackwood's literature frequently delves into the exploration of hidden forces within the natural world – often drawing on his personal experiences and encounters with nature throughout his life. By emphasizing humanity's limited comprehension of these forces, Blackwood is able to tap into the innate fear of the unknown and successfully create an eerie atmosphere in his stories.

A prime example of this can be found in Blackwood's most famous work, "The Willows," where two protagonists are haunted by vague, unnameable forces within a remote and desolate landscape. Through vivid descriptions of the surrounding environment and the ever-worsening psychological states of the characters, Blackwood infuses his story with a sense of impending doom and primal terror. Notably, Blackwood never relies on explicit horror elements or overt supernatural beings to instill fear; instead, he focuses on the characters' emotional and psychological experiences to inspire terror in the reader.

Another important aspect of Blackwood's writing is his belief in the interconnectedness of all living things and a broader spiritual reality, which he often portrayed in his works. He believed that nature was imbued with hidden mystical energies, which humans could only sense or access through specific mental or spiritual states. This concept is closely related to panpsychism – a philosophical and occult belief that consciousness is a fundamental component of the universe and is present in all things.

In conclusion, Algernon Blackwood's approach to combining elements of the occult and esoteric with an emphasis on nature and its mysterious forces is characterized by his use of atmospheric tone and emphasis on the characters' psychological experiences. Through his works, Blackwood was able to create a sense of awe and terror that remains influential in the genre and continues to captivate readers to this day.
