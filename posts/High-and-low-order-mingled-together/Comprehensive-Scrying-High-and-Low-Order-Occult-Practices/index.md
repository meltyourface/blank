To perform a comprehensive technique for scrying by incorporating both high and low order occult practices, follow these steps:

1. Preparation of the sacred space:
   a. Choose a quiet, dimly lit room where you can work undisturbed.
   b. Cleanse the area by burning sage or another purifying herb and sweeping the area in a counterclockwise direction, starting in the eastern corner.
   c. Set up an altar in the center of the room, where you'll place your tarot cards, pendulum, consecrated black mirror, and incense.
   d. Arrange elemental representations around the altar: a bowl of salt (earth) to the north, a red candle (fire) to the south, incense (air) to the east, and a chalice of water (water) to the west.
   e. Draw protective sigils on parchment and place one in each cardinal direction. You can use traditional symbols like the pentagram or design your own, based on your personal associations and intentions.

2. Invocation of guardian spirits and energies:
   a. Begin by grounding and centering yourself with deep, rhythmic breathing, visualizing your energy connecting to the earth below and the cosmos above.
   b. Call upon your guardian spirits, angels, or guides by performing a simple invocation: light the incense and say, "I call upon [name of spirits or energies] to guide, protect, and empower me during this sacred scrying ritual."
   c. Optionally, use a banishing ritual of your choice to further cleanse the space and reinforce your protective boundaries.

3. Achieving an altered state of consciousness:
   a. Select a chant or mantra that resonates with you, and repeat it in a steady rhythm to induce a trance-like state.
   b. Practice slow, diaphragmatic breathing, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. As you breathe, visualize drawing in positive energy and releasing any anxieties or distractions.
   c. As an alternative, employ a mindfulness meditation technique, concentrating on your breath and allowing thoughts to arise and pass without judgment.

4. Scrying process:
   a. Once you've achieved a heightened state of consciousness, gaze into the consecrated black mirror, allowing your eyes to relax and defocus.
   b. Interpret the patterns or symbols appearing in the mirror, using your intuition and knowledge of various divination systems, such as tarot, astrology, numerology, or Kabbalah, to glean insights.
   c. Enhance the session by using a pendulum over the tarot cards, asking yes-or-no questions to clarify or confirm the visions you receive.

5. Challenges and remedies:
   a. Difficulty focusing: If your mind wanders or you struggle to attain a meditative state, return to your rhythmic breathing or chanting techniques. Don't be too hard on yourself; practice makes perfect.
   b. Overwhelmed by symbols: Should the complex patterns or symbols become too overwhelming, take a step back and focus on one aspect at a time. You can also record your impressions in a journal for later reflection and analysis.
   c. Negative influences or energies: If you feel any negative presence or energy during the session, immediately cease and perform a banishing ritual or prayer to dispel it. Cleansing the room again and reinforcing your protective symbols can also help.

6. Closing the ritual:
   a. Thank your guardian spirits, energies, and guides for their assistance, then release them with a simple statement, such as, "I release you with gratitude and love."
   b. Extinguish the candles, incense, and dispose of any offerings appropriately.
   c. Ground and center yourself once more, visualizing any excess energy flowing back into the earth or cosmos.
   d. You may choose to keep a record of your scrying session, noting impressions, symbols, and insights for future reference and analysis.

Remember that scrying is a deeply personal and intuitive practice. Your experiences may vary, and developing your skills may require patience and regular practice. By incorporating both high and low order occult elements, you will create a rich, holistic experience that can offer valuable insights and guidance in your spiritual journey.
