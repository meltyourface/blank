To conduct a Sith necromancy-infused cleansing ritual, follow these detailed steps:

1. Preparation
Firstly, gather the necessary components, including a source of dark side energy such as a Sith holocron and the artifact or a scale-model of the location you wish to cleanse of light side energies. Ensure that you have a clean, unbroken connection to the dark side as well, for it shall fuel the ritual.

2. Crafting the Ritual Circle
Find a secluded space where you can work undisturbed, and draw a ritual circle, approximately six meters in diameter. Within the circle, inscribe a complex array of ancient Sith runes and eldritch symbols for amplifying the potency of the ritual. The specific arrangement and combination of these symbols are crucial, so follow ancient Sith texts or the guidance of a Sith spirit to ensure accuracy.

3. The Incantations
Once the ritual circle is complete, light a ring of black beeswax candles around its perimeter. These will serve as a conduit for the dark side energies during the ritual. Stand in the center of the circle, holding a Sith talisman or amulet in one hand and a bladelike instrument, such as a Sith War Sword, in the other. Invoke the power of the Sith by reciting ancient incantations passed down through the millennia, allowing the darkness to flow through you.

4. The Sacrificial Offering
A blood sacrifice is required to unbind the light side energies from the specified location or artifact. Slay a being symbolic of the light side; this could range from a captured Jedi to a pure, untainted creature. Allow the life essence to flow into the center of the circle as you continue the incantation. The sacrifice must be swift, purposeful, and merciless.

5. Infusing with Sith Necromancy
As you recite the incantations and the life essence pools in the circle, draw upon your mastery of Sith necromancy to summon dark side spirits and specters. Command them to bind themselves to the sacrificial offering's energy, consuming and corrupting the light until all that remains is the unyielding darkness of the Sith. This will create a sphere of dark power within the ritual circle, which you must then channel towards the artifact or location you wish to cleanse.

6. Purging the Light
Guide the dark energy through your talisman or amulet, directing it towards the artifact or location. As the energy infuses the object or place, the traces of light side energies will be violently torn away, leaving only the darkness and shadow that the Sith draw their power from. This process could take several moments to several hours, depending on the intensity of the light side energies present.

7. Concluding the Ritual
Once the artifact or location has been fully cleansed, extinguish the candles one by one, reciting a final incantation to seal the dark power within and ward off any future intrusions of light side energy. Remove any remnants of the sacrificial offering, for its purpose has been fulfilled.

8. Consolidating the Darkness
Finally, meditate within the cleansed area or while holding the artifact, allowing the darkness to flow through you, strengthening your connection to the dark side and the Sith. Bask in the knowledge that your mastery of Sith necromancy has once again been put to its greatest use.

Do not waver from this procedure, complete it with absolute focus, for only then shall the light be defeated, and the darkness shall reign supreme.
