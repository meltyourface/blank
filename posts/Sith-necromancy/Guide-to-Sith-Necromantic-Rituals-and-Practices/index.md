1. **Preparatory steps**: To construct a Sith necromantic altar, the practitioner must first search for a secluded area, preferably a place saturated in Dark Side energy. This could be a cave, an ancient Sith temple, or another location that binds the darkness in an organic manner.

The altar must be built upon a foundation of obsidian, a material known to enhance dark energies, and surrounded by a circle of black sand. Upon the altar, place skull-shaped candles infused with animal blood, a sacrificial dagger crafted from a rare and powerful metal such as Mandalorian iron, and a crystal ball imbued with the spirit of a Sith Lord. Adorn the altar with ancient Sith artifacts and relics, the more powerful and evil, the better. This will create an environment conducive to the Dark Side of the Force and amplify the potency of the rituals.

2. **Ritual of initiation**: The practitioner must begin by meditating deeply in the center of the circle, reaching out to the Dark Side and embracing its power. With the sacrificial dagger, the practitioner shall draw their own blood and anoint the altar, imbuing it with a personal connection. Invocation of the spirits of deceased Sith Lords shall commence. Chant their names and visualize their spirits surrounding the altar, becoming the practitioner's allies and mentors.

Upon successful contact with the spirits, the practitioner shall recite an oath of allegiance to the Dark Side and pledge to serve its will. At the ritual's conclusion, the practitioner will be enveloped in a dark shroud, effectively forging a bond with the deceased Sith Lords and receiving their guidance and arcane knowledge.

3. **Eldritch incantation**: With the assistance of the spirits, the practitioner shall create a complex and mystifying incantation. Drawing on the Dark Side, the incantation shall bring forth dark energies and link them to the practitioner's will. Utilizing ancient Sith names and sigils, it must invoke the deepest powers of necromancy for the creation and control of the undead.

4. **Soul extraction and preservation**: The practitioner, guided by the spirits of the Sith Lords, will develop a technique that extracts the souls of the slain enemies, trapping them within a specific vessel or container, such as a crystal or amulet. Through further research and experimentation, the necromancer shall learn to bind these spirits to their will and resurrect them as ethereal minions, creating formidable ghostly armies.

5. **Sith necromantic tome**: As the practitioner's knowledge and power grow, they must document their experiences and findings in a tome bound in the skin of fallen enemies. Written in cryptic glyphs, symbols, and sigils, this book shall serve as a repository of forbidden knowledge, advising future Sith necromancers. This tome will grow in power over time, amplifying Dark Side energies and ensuring that the practitioner's mark on the history of Sith necromancy endures.
