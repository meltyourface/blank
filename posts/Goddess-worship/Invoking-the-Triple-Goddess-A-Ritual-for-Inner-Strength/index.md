In the name of the most Sacred Triple Goddess, blessed Maiden, nurturing Mother, and wise Crone, I stand before thee, humbly seeking your divine protection and guidance. Oh, hallowed trinity of feminine power, grant me thy sacred energies to shield me from harm and illuminate my path as I navigate the complexities of this world.

Envision within your mind's eye the radiant crescent moon, a symbol of the Maiden and her transformative energy. Silently call out to her:

"Blessed Maiden, youthful embodiment of fresh beginnings,
Goddess of the waxing moon and the morning dew,
I invoke your pure and transformative energy to grace my life.
Fill me with the vigor, courage, and resilience to embark on new journeys,
To navigate the challenges that come with growth and change.
As the crescent moon ascends in the sky,
So shall my spirit rise to meet each challenge,
Guided by your steadfast light."

Feel the Maiden's transformative energy surge through your being, empowering and strengthening your resolve.

Next, visualize the cosmic glow of the full moon, embodying the nurturing essence of the Mother. Invoke her wisdom by reciting:

"Divine Mother, life-giver and nurturing force,
Goddess of the full moon and the fertile earth,
I summon your unconditional love and guidance upon my soul.
Envelop me in your warm embrace,
Providing me sustenance, resilience, and steadfastness,
As I traverse the ebb and flow of life.
Protect me in your ever-flowing, maternal light,
Fill me with love and grace as boundless as the radiance of the full moon."

Sense the nurturing energy of the Mother as it envelops you, providing comfort and stability in uncertain times.

Finally, envision the waning moon, an emblem of the wise Crone. Speak to her and ask of her knowledge:

"Sacred Crone, keeper of ancient knowledge,
Goddess of the waning moon and the twilight hour,
I invoke your wisdom and timeless insight to guide my way.
Grant me the clarity to see the truth in all things,
The strength to confront the shadows within and without,
And the ability to learn from each passing moment.
Like the waning moon, let your wisdom illuminate the darkness,
Leaving no corner of my soul untouched by your guiding presence."

Embrace the wisdom of the Crone, as it courses through your spirit, providing you with the knowledge and understanding necessary to navigate life's complexities.

With the sacred energies of the Triple Goddess - the transformative Maiden, nurturing Mother, and wise Crone - now interwoven into the very fabric of your being, feel their divine protection enveloping you. Guided by their eternal light, know that you are safeguarded and cherished as you continue your journey upon the earth. So mote it be.
