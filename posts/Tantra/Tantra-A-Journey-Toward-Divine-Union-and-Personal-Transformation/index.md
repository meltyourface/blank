To answer this knowledge challenge, I will start by briefly introducing Tantra and its core principles. Then, I will explain how the philosophy of Tantra relates to divine union, personal transformation, and spiritual liberation. Finally, I will analyze its influence on modern esoteric practices, particularly in terms of achieving self-realization. 

Tantra is a broad and complex system of religious, philosophical, and mystical practices that originated in ancient India. It encompasses a range of beliefs and practices that seek to cultivate and harness the inherent energies within the individual for spiritual awakening, transformation, and union with the divine. At its core, Tantra is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of direct personal experience and the integration of all aspects of life including body, mind, and spirit.

Divine Union: 
One of the primary goals of Tantra is the realization of divine union, both within the individual and with the cosmos. This can be achieved through the sacred union of masculine and feminine energies, commonly symbolized by Shiva (consciousness) and Shakti (energy). In Tantra, the practitioner seeks to awaken and harmonize these energies within themselves, leading to the recognition that the duality of existence is illusory and the ultimate reality is non-dual. This divine union can also be experienced through various practices such as meditation, yoga, and sexual rituals that foster deep connections with oneself, others, and the divine.

Personal Transformation:
The philosophy of Tantra is centered around the concept of personal transformation. It posits that all aspects of human existence can be utilized as a means for spiritual growth and development. Tantra acknowledges that life's challenges and even mundane activities can serve as opportunities for the practitioner to embrace their true nature and achieve self-realization. By engaging in spiritual practices, such as meditation, mantra, visualization, and energy work, the individualâ€™s consciousness is expanded, leading to profound self-awareness, self-mastery, and ultimately, a transformation of one's entire being.

Spiritual Liberation:
Tantra seeks to attain spiritual liberation, or moksha, through transcending the limitations of embodiment and the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. This is achieved by harnessing the energies within and without, purifying the individual from karmic influences, and establishing a direct connection with the divine. In Tantra, spiritual liberation is not an end in itself, but rather a means to express and embody the divine in daily life. This approach encourages the practitioner to move beyond mere philosophical understanding and initiates the experiential knowing that engenders deep, transformative insights. 

Influence on Modern Esoteric Practices:
In contemporary spirituality, elements of Tantra have influenced various esoteric practices, both in Eastern and Western traditions. This can be observed in the rise of neo-Tantric practices focused on sacred sexuality, the integration of Tantric meditation techniques in modern mindfulness practices, and the incorporation of Kundalini yoga into contemporary spiritual teachings. These modern reinterpretations, often stripped of their cultural and historical contexts, emphasize the pursuit of self-realization and an experiential understanding of the divine.

To summarize, Tantra is a rich and complex tradition that emphasizes the pursuit of divine union, personal transformation, and spiritual liberation. By harnessing and harmonizing masculine and feminine energies within, the practitioner transcends duality and experiences non-dual reality. Tantra offers a unique approach to spiritual awakening by encouraging the exploration of all aspects of life as a vehicle for transformation. Furthermore, its influence has permeated contemporary esoteric practices, placing a strong emphasis on direct experience and techniques leading to self-realization.
