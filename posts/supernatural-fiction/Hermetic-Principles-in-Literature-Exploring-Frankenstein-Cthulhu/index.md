excerpt: > 
  Analyze how the hermetic principle "As above, so below" is reflected in the narrative structure and characters' development in both Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu". Consider the portrayals of the creators, their creations, and the consequences of tampering with the unknown, and discuss the implications these literary works hold for the insights into the collective unconscious.

To respond to this knowledge challenge, I will first provide an overview of the Hermetic principle "As above, so below" and its interpretation in relation to the esoteric, occult, and supernatural studies. Subsequently, I shall examine the mentioned principle in the context of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu" concerning narrative structure, characters' development, portrayals of creators and creations, and the consequences of tampering with the unknown. Concluding the response will be an analysis of the implications these literary works have for insights into the collective unconscious.

As Above, So Below
The Hermetic principle "As above, so below" is derived from the ancient Emerald Tablet, which is attributed to the legendary figure Hermes Trismegistus. The key tenet of this principle is that the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual) are inextricably connected by shared patterns, structures, and phenomena. In esoteric, occult, and supernatural studies, this principle represents the understanding that the events and processes occurring on a grand scale reflect those happening on a smaller, individual scale. Essentially, the cosmic order mirrors the personal order, which can have profound implications when applied to literary works.

Frankenstein
Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" embodies the Hermetic principle "As above, so below" through its narrative structure, character development, and the consequences of tampering with the unknown. Victor Frankenstein, the protagonist and scientist-creator, embarks on a quest to unlock the secrets of life and death in his study of alchemy and the sciences. As his knowledge grows, so too does his ambition, which results in the creation of a humanoid figure, the Creature.

The parallelisms in the story reflect the Hermetic principle through the creator and the creation, Victor and the Creature. As Victor pursues power over life and death, disregarding consequences and ethical boundaries, the Creature becomes a manifestation of the darker aspects of Victor's consciousness. Victor's struggle with the distinction between good and evil is mirrored in the Creature's struggle for acceptance and understanding. The story's tragic events narrate the spiral of devastation that unfolds as Victor and the Creature's fates become increasingly intertwined.

The Call of Cthulhu
H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu" unveils the Hermetic principle "As above, so below" in its narrative structure and the development of its characters. The story revolves around a series of interconnected narratives, where the protagonist, Francis Wayland Thurston, uncovers a hidden world of ancient cosmic entities. The central figure of this mythos is Cthulhu, an extraterrestrial being that lies dormant beneath the ocean in the sunken city of R'lyeh.

The creator and creation dynamic is prominent in the story through the portrayal of these cosmic entities and their cult followers. Humans attempt to awaken Cthulhu and harness its power, revealing their insatiable thirst for knowledge and control. These flawed qualities mirror the self-destructive tendencies inherent within the cosmic beings â€“ immense power coupled with the potential for chaos and destruction.

Both narratives warn against the perils of tampering with unknown forces, highlighting the dire consequences resulting from humans meddling with powers beyond their control. These literary works echo the ever-present struggle between order and chaos, reinforcing that interference with such forces may lead to catastrophic consequences.

Implications for Collective Unconscious
Both "Frankenstein" and "The Call of Cthulhu" provide insights into the collective unconscious, highlighting humanity's intrinsic need to uncover the unknown and the potential destruction that may ensue. These stories symbolize the inherent aspects of human nature that drive individuals to explore and push boundaries, leading them perilously close to their demise, and thus reflecting an intricate balance between profound knowledge and chaos.

In summary, the Hermetic principle "As above, so below" is masterfully reflected in both Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu." Their narratives showcase the interconnectedness of cosmic and human orders, reveal the potentially disastrous consequences arising from meddling with unknown forces, and highlight humanity's deep-rooted propensity for exploration and trespassing. Furthermore, these literary works offer valuable insights into the collective unconscious and serve as cautionary tales that remind us of the price of unchecked human ambition.
