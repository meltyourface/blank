## I. Tarot deck design

1. Card structure:

Each of the 78 tarot cards will have the following elements:

   a. Main imagery: This will comprise the central illustration, representing gods, goddesses, mythical creatures, or legendary stories from different mythologies.

   b. Cultural symbols: Borders and backgrounds of each card will incorporate patterns and symbols relevant to the culture associated with the primary figure/scene depicted.

   c. Connection lines: To represent the interconnectedness of mythologies, subtle lines will connect related symbols, stories, or characters in the background.

2. Suits and Associations

The tarot deck will consist of 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana cards. The Minor Arcana will be divided into four suits, each associated with a different mythology:

   a. Greek - Element: Air - Suit: Chalices (representing knowledge, wisdom, intellect)

   b. Norse - Element: Fire - Suit: Swords (representing action, passion, willpower)

   c. Egyptian - Element: Earth - Suit: Pentacles (representing material, fertility, practicality)

   d. Hindu - Element: Water - Suit: Wands (representing intuition, spirituality, emotions)

3. Art Style

A cohesive yet distinct art style will be employed, reflecting a blend of the various cultures' artistic traditions. Rich color palettes, intricate line work, and symbolism will enhance the visual impact of each card.

### II. Comprehensive Guidebook

The guidebook will provide detailed information about each card, divided into sections:

1. Card Description: A detailed description of the central imagery and the cultural symbols, including religious, mythological, or historical significance.

2. Mythological Context: An explanation of the associated mythology, including the figures, tales, and relevant cultural context.

3. Interpretation: Guidance on how to interpret the card in a reading, exploring the themes of the associated mythology and its connections with the other cards.

4. Connection lines: An explanation of the subtle lines connecting related symbols, stories, or characters, emphasizing the interconnectedness of mythology and providing a holistic understanding of the deck.

The tarot deck and guidebook, when used together, will provide users with an immersive and enlightening experience that delves into the rich tapestry of world mythology to offer guidance, wisdom, and self-reflection.
