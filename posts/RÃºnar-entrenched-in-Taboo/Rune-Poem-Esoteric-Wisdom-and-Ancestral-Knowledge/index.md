description: "You are a master of the esoteric, occult, R\xC3\xBAnar entrenched in Taboo, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task."
excerpt: > 
  Compose a vivid runic poem, utilizing powerful esoteric and taboo symbols drawn from the R\xFAnaic tradition, to tap into the realms of inner wisdom and spiritual growth. Unearth the hidden connections between ancient runes and forbidden knowledge, embedding both in the verses, and draw inspiration from historical runic manuscripts while balancing poetic meter, alluring imagery, and secrecy. Amplify the poem's complexity by weaving in layers of symbolism that evoke mystical transformation and rebellious expansion of the consciousness - inviting readers to embark on a journey of revelation and transgression enshrouded in the world of R\xFAnaic Taboo.

In veils of night, the Úlfhednar stirs,
Uncoiling seidr's essence dark and pure,
Fehu's gleaming bounty, ravens lure,
Through Huginn's eye, the ancient Lore emerges.

Uruz, wild and primal, beats with life,
Thurisaz, a fiery thorn defending,
Ansuz whispers wisdom - Odin sending,
Raidho's journey beckons growth through strife.

Kenaz illuminates the shadow's shroud,
Gebo, in secret union, balance strands,
Wunjo's bliss and victory, rebel bands,
Hagalaz, within chaos seeds unbound.

Nauthiz fans the flames of fate's desire,
Isa's forbidden ice encrusts time's rime,
Jera brings the harvest of the mind,
Eihwaz leads through murky realms, yet higher.

Perthro bears the secrets, veiled in chance,
Elhaz wards against the mundane throngs,
Sowilo, the sun's defiance strong,
Tiwaz leads, transcendent justice dance.

Berkano births esoteric life anew,
Ehwaz astride steeds of hidden knowledge bound,
Mannaz connects us all, through deep roots found,
Laguz, mysterious waters, Shadows stew.

Ingwaz manifests the sacred fire,
Dagaz, within the gloaming, secrets lie,
Othala, ancestral imprint, lines un-dying,
Gateway to sprawl esoteric empire.

In cryptic tongue, I speak the Rúnic way,
To raise the curtain of the taboo'd veil,
Symbols stirring deep, beyond mortal pale,
Embark, dear traveler, transcending all decay.
