excerpt: Assess the impact of religious beliefs, with a particular emphasis on Christian doctrines, on the evolution and understanding of necromancy in Western culture through the lens of historic necromancers. Examine the intersection of prominent necromancers, such as Johannes Nider and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, with Christian ideologies and determine how biblical figures and texts may have shaped their practices. Furthermore, explore how these views eventually influenced public perception and contributed to the complexities of necromantic practices that have persisted throughout history.

The understanding and practice of necromancy in Western culture have been significantly influenced by religious beliefs, especially Christian doctrines and biblical texts. A deep dive into the evolution of necromancy through the lens of historic necromancers reveals the fascinating intersection between such magical practices and the religious beliefs of the period.

Johannes Nider, a theologian, and demonologist who lived in the 15th century is known for his work "Formicarius," which detailed various instances of witchcraft and demonology. In this work, he also discussed necromancy, which was often seen as a type of demonic magic, given that it involved communication with the dead or spirits. Nider's work was shaped by his Christian beliefs, as the concept of demonic magic was considered to be sinful and heretical. Therefore, Nider condemned necromancy based on his understanding of Christianity and the notion that communing with the dead challenged the authority of God and His divine plan.

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a 16th-century physician, and occultist was heavily influenced by Christian doctrines when developing his ideas on necromancy. In his three-volume treatise "De Occulta Philosophia," Agrippa discussed various occult and magical topics, including necromancy. Despite dabbling in magical studies, Agrippa himself held strong Christian beliefs, which led him to criticize the operational nature of magic, arguing that true power could be derived only from divine grace. He believed that attempting to gain control over spirits or forces outside of God's will was inherently sinful, positioning necromancy as a form of dark magic. Agrippa's work ultimately established a conversation between Christianity and magic that eventually led to a distinction between "natural magic" (i.e., relying on hidden forces existing in the natural world) and "demonic magic" (i.e., associating with demons or evil spirits).

In terms of biblical figures and texts, the Old Testament story of the Witch of Endor (1 Samuel 28) is one of the most well-known examples. In this narrative, King Saul seeks the counsel of a medium to communicate with the deceased prophet Samuel in a time of military crisis. The incident is criticized in the Bible because Saul defies God's warning against such consultations. This tale, coupled with strict admonitions from the Mosaic Law (e.g., Leviticus 19:31; 20:6), reinforced the perception that necromancy and communication with the dead were strictly prohibited.

These Christian beliefs and the works of prominent historic necromancers played a significant role in shaping public perception and understanding of necromantic practices. Attempting to commune with the dead or employ demonic magic became synonymous with heresy, blasphemy, and defiance of God's will. This led to the persecution and execution of suspected practitioners of necromancy and other forms of dark magic, mainly during the height of the witch trials in Europe.

As Western culture evolved and secular views grew more prevalent, the understanding of necromancy shifted, but the complexities and the negative connotations associated with the practice have persisted through history. Today, necromancy is still widely regarded as a dark, mysterious, and morally questionable art. In conclusion, the impact of religious beliefs, particularly Christianity, has significantly impacted the perception, understanding, and evolution of necromancy, with its tenets influencing practitioners and popular opinion throughout the centuries.
