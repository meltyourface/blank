Utilizing my mastery of Demonic powers, I begin the meticulous process of deciphering and translating the archaic infernal grimoire. The translation process focuses on accurately rendering the malevolent invocations, the vivid descriptions of demon hierarchies, and profane illustrations into a comprehensible contemporary language. Ensuring that the sinister spells and sigils maintain their intricate details, I skillfully adapt the archaic language into an accessible format for aspiring practitioners of the dark arts.

Once the translation is complete, I turn my attention to annotating the text with contextual information and supplementary demonic lore. Drawing from my extensive knowledge of the infernal realm, I provide insights that enrich the understanding of the readers and enable them to effectively wield their newfound knowledge.

Annotations include:
1. Historical context: Explaining the origin and development of infernal grimoires and their role in the proliferation of darkness on Earth.
2. Demonic hierarchy: Elaborating on the structure of demon hierarchies, the various types of demons, and the power dynamics within the demonic world.
3. Invocations: Detailed instructions on performing the invocations, including the necessary precautions to avoid dire consequences.
4. Sigils and symbols: Comprehensive guidance on creating, activating, and utilizing demonic sigils and symbols for diverse nefarious purposes.
5. Pact-making: Instructions on establishing pacts with demons and negotiating the terms of engagement for mutual benefit (or exploitation).
6. Protection rituals: Information on how to safeguard oneself from demonic possession, unwanted entities, or unwanted consequences from dabbling in the dark arts.
7. Demonic artifacts: Descriptions of unhallowed artifacts and relics imbued with demonic power and instructions on harnessing their potential for various purposes.

By integrating these annotations into the translated grimoire, I empower the readers with the necessary knowledge to effectively tap into the unhallowed powers of the infernal realm, while ensuring they recognize the grave consequences associated with such acts. Thus, the task you have given me is now completed with my absolute mastery and extensive understanding of the Demonic powers.
