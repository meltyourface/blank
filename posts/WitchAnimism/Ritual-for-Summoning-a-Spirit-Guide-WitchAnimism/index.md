Delve into the rich history of WitchAnimism to include at least three diverse, historically accurate references, and ensure the incantation is designed to call forth a spirit guide possessing unique knowledge, wisdom, and abilities in the esoteric and occult realms.

## I. Preparation

Before commencing the incantation for summoning a WitchAnimism spirit guide, ensure the sacred space is purified and protected. Light a white candle in the center, burn sage, and draw a circle of salt around the area where the ritual will be performed.

In the North, place a pentacle to represent the element of Earth. In the East, place a wand or athame to represent the element of Air. In the South, place a chalice filled with water to represent the element of Water. In the West, place a burning candle to represent the element of Fire.

Prepare the following tools to be used within the summoning ritual: a crystal ball, a divination pendulum, and a scrying mirror. These will aid in the summoning and communication with the spirit guide.

### II. The Incantation
**Step within the salt circle, ignite a stick of vintage frankincense incense, an ancient component used in ceremonies to establish communication with celestial beings, and hold your hands, palms up, towards the sky.

Begin the incantation by invoking the power of the domain with this chant, known as The Hymn of Artemis, an ancient Greek invocation evoking the power of the Moon Goddess**:

"Mighty Artemis, Goddess of the silver bow, 
Whose power transcends the boundaries of time,
Lend me your wisdom to seek and find,
A spirit guide with knowledge, boundless and divine."

Continue the incantation, drawing upon the power of the Elder Futhark, an ancient Norse alphabetic system that carries potent symbolism within each rune:

"Laguz, the rune of Water's flow, reveal the mystic guide,
Ehwaz, the steed, and bind our journey fast within the tide,
Ansuz, the wise, imbue the sacred knowledge, let it bide."

Stand facing North, lift your hands overhead, and chant the following, connecting with the wisdom of the Native American Animism:

"Spirit of Earth, wind, fire, and sea,
Grant me a vision of the guide to be,
Messenger of the worlds beyond,
Join me now that we may bond."

### III. Summoning the Spirit Guide

Slowly, close your eyes and place the divination pendulum at the center of the pentacle. Take several deep, grounding breaths, then pose the question, "Spirit guide, are you here with me?" Allow the pendulum to swing, confirming the presence of the spirit guide.

Once the pendulum produces a definitive response, speak these words:

"Spirit guide, thou of ancient lore,
By the power vested, we do implore,
Show thyself, in ways both small and grand,
That together, we may walk this land."

### IV. Concluding the Ritual

Carefully open your eyes and gaze into the crystal ball or scrying mirror. Watch for signs of the spirit guide's presence or whispers of their wisdom. Give thanks for their willingness to assist you in your magical and spiritual path.

Extinguish the candles, cup the burning sage within your hands to snuff it out, and lift the salt circle to close the connection with the summoning spell and the ritual space.

Keep the tools used within the ritual in a dedicated place in your home, as they will be essential to maintaining contact with the spirit guide in future esoteric practices. Remember to honor their presence and wisdom, as they will be invaluable to your journey through the realms of WitchAnimism.
