To embark on the response to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the context and the central figure of the inquiry: the "Horned God" within the Mythos of the Sabbatic conclave. The Mythos of the Sabbatic conclave refers to a body of beliefs, rituals, and practices centered around the secretive assembly of witches, sorcerers, and esoteric practitioners. Within this Mythos, the "Horned God" is a key figure, often associated with themes such as nature, life, death, rebirth, and transformation.

Now, let us dive into the multifaceted aspects of the “Horned God” figure by exploring its various manifestations and roles in ancient mythologies, folklore, and the Western esoteric tradition.

1. Ancient Mythologies:
The "Horned God" archetype can be found across numerous ancient mythologies such as Celtic, Greco-Roman, Nordic, and Egyptian traditions. In Celtic mythology, the horned deity Cernunnos stands as the God of nature, fertility, and the transition between life and death. The Greek Pan, known for his rustic appearance and involving his goaty legs, horns, and robust sexuality, is another example of the relation between the Horned God and fertility/nature themes. Similarly, the Nordic fertility deity Freyr exhibits horned imagery, and in Egyptian mythology, the horned god Khnum symbolizes creation and the life-giving force of the Nile River.

2. Folklore:
Historical folklore and legends from Europe feature motifs of horned figures as well. For instance, the British Isles' Herne the Hunter – shrouded in the veil of mystery, often portrayed as a guardian of the forest and a harbinger of transformative experiences. Similarly, the folklore of the Wild Hunt in Germanic and Scandinavian traditions presents horned leaders chasing spirits in a never-ending pursuit, symbolizing liminal states and transitions.

3. Western Esoteric Tradition:
The "Horned God" figure appears in esoteric practices such as alchemy, hermeticism, and the modern Pagan and Wiccan traditions. For instance, the depiction of Baphomet, a goat-headed, androgynous figure often associated with occultism and alchemy, embodies the concepts of duality, unification, and the harmony of opposites. In Wicca and modern witchcraft, the Horned God is crucial, representing the complementary divine masculine aspect to the Goddess, symbolizing the cyclical aspects of nature and life. 

By evaluating the various perspectives on the "Horned God" archetype in ancient mythologies, folklore, and Western esoteric tradition, we can derive some broader themes and meanings relevant to the Sabbatic conclave's rites and initiatory path:

1. Liminality and Transformation:
The "Horned God" figure embodies the idea of crossing boundaries (both physical and metaphysical) and represents essential transitions in life, death, and rebirth. This symbolism resonates with the Sabbatic conclave's initiatory path, where initiates undergo transformative experiences through rituals and challenges to attain higher levels of understanding and spiritual growth.

2. Nature and Fertility:
The "Horned God" is intrinsically linked to the natural world, often symbolizing fertility and the life-giving forces of the Earth. The rites and practices of the Sabbatic conclave maintain a deep reverence for nature and harness its powers to facilitate spiritual and magical work.

3. Duality and Balance:
The "Horned God" in various traditions reflects the concept of duality and balance between opposites (e.g., life/death, light/dark, masculine/feminine). The Sabbatic conclave seeks to harmonize these dualities in its practices and teachings, allowing initiates to tap into a more profound understanding of the universe's interconnectedness.

In conclusion, the recurring symbolism of the "Horned God" figure in the Mythos of the Sabbatic conclave and its diverse manifestations within ancient mythologies, folklore, and Western esoteric traditions ultimately contribute to our understanding of the Sabbatic conclave's rites through the exploration of liminality, transformation, nature, fertility, duality, and balance. By analyzing these aspects, we gain essential insight into the nature and purpose of the Sabbatic conclave's initiatory path and deepen our comprehension of the broader Mythos.
