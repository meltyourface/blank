To create this intricate geomantic divination ritual, follow these steps:

1. **Preparation**: Begin by selecting a serene location, ideally an outdoor space that feels connected to the Earth. Set up a ritual space in this location by calmly lighting candles, burning incense, and placing a compass to determine accurate cardinal directions. On a sheet of parchment, draw a large circle, and divide it into 16 equal sections, labeling them with the 16 geomantic figures, such as Acquisitio, Amissio, and Fortuna Major.

2. **Astrological Alignment**: Determine the exact date, time, and location to perform the ritual, ensuring they are auspicious according to astrological charts. Align the ritual with favorable planetary positions and lunar phases that are supportive of your business endeavor.

3. **Invocation**: Begin the ritual by invoking the guidance and wisdom of the elemental spirits associated with each geomantic figure. Call upon the spirits of Earth (Caput Draconis and Cauda Draconis), Air (Puer and Puella), Fire (Fortuna Major and Fortuna Minor), and Water (Acquisitio and Amissio).

4. **Divination Process**: Focus on the business question and meditate on the various aspects involved, including goals, obstacles, and resources. Randomly select 4 geomantic figures from the circle, and place them in a tetrad formation, assigning one to each direction (north, south, east, west).

5. **Visualization**: Visualize each figure as a presence in your ritual circle, working together in dynamic balance to analyze the astrological influences and harmonize the energies for your strategic endeavor. Contemplate their interrelationships and dominion over different aspects of the decision-making process.

6. **Sigil Creation**: Combine the 4 geomantic figures into a single sigil, representing the unified forces guiding your business strategy. This sigil serves as a tangible focus for your divination and a powerful reminder of the esoteric wisdom obtained.

7. **Interpretation**: Examine and decipher the resulting geomantic sigil, divining the patterns and interactions of the figures chosen and connecting them to the aspects of your business endeavor. Analyze the sigil and geomantic relationships to extract guidance, foresight, and a comprehensive understanding of the potential outcome.

8. **Contemplation**: Meditate on the geomantic sigil and its significant aspects, such as elemental dominion, interaction between figures, and astrological correlations. Reflect on how this esoteric wisdom informs your business strategy and how it may influence your decision-making process.

9. **Conclusion**: Thank the elemental spirits and close the ritual by extinguishing the candles and clearing the ritual space. Reflect on the insights gained and how they will direct your strategic business endeavor.

Through this elaborate geomantic ritual, you will meticulously assess and interpret the potential ramifications and success of your business decision, taking into account subtle astrological influences, and drawing upon the esoteric power of geomantic figures and their interrelationships.
