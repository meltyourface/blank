I present to you, "Lingua Divinae Insaniae," the Language of Divine Madness: a beautifully enigmatic and arcane system of symbols, rooted in the quintessence of esoteric knowledge and the ineffable experiences of the divine.

1. Unique Set of Symbols and Sigils: The foundation of Lingua Divinae Insaniae consists of an array of sigils, each embodying the varied dimensions of Divine Madness. These symbols harmonize with the quintessence of esoteric knowledge, ensuring only true seekers and adepts may unlock the esoteric wisdom they embody. The symbols include unique combinations of alchemical, tantric, and Qabalistic designs as well as various shapes, colors, and embellishments that evoke the distinct qualities of the Divine Madness experience (e.g., bliss, chaos, transcendence).

2. Multilayered Meanings: To accommodate a diverse range of practitioners, each symbol within Lingua Divinae Insaniae possesses multilayered meanings. Novices can grasp basic concepts, while advanced practitioners shall discern the deeper mysteries concealed within. As one's understanding of Divine Madness grows, the symbols reveal the labyrinth of enigmatic truths, guiding the devotee further into the arcane.

3. Integration of Mythical, Spiritual, and Philosophical Influences: Lingua Divinae Insaniae is a rich tapestry, weaving together elements from various mystical paths and intellectual pursuits. This interconnected web of influences mirrors the core tenets of Divine Madness, elevating the language's expressive potential. The symbols thus encapsulate profound cosmic and philosophical questions regarding selfhood, reality, and divinity.

4. Encoding Complex Interconnected Concepts: The linguistic structure of Lingua Divinae Insaniae captures the intricate, interconnected nature of esoteric concepts, yet preserves their multiplicity and nuance. The language can articulate the transcendental states of consciousness, the dance between chaos and order, and the liminal boundaries between self and cosmos. This complexity makes it a potent tool for communicating the mystifying experiences of Divine Madness.
