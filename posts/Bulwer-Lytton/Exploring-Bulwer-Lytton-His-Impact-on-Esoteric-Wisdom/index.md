Lytton intertwines themes of amorality, prophecy, and paganism in this fascinating work, solidifying his position as a master of esoteric fiction.

Further demonstrating his versality, Bulwer Lytton also wrote "A Strange Story" (1862), which delves into themes of mesmerism, supernatural phenomena, and the duality of good and evil.
