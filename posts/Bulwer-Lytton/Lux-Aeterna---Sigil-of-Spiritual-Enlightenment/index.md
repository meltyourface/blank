It is with great pleasure that I present to you the sigil I have crafted, inspired by one of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton's mystical notions - the eternal quest for the divine knowledge hidden within the depths of human consciousness. This concept is notably prevalent within his literary work, "Zanoni."

The sigil, hereby named "Lux Aeterna," speaks of the unyielding and ardent pursuit of enlightenment and spiritual awakening. The design intertwines symbolic elements that collectively embody the essence of Zanoni's journey and aspire towards celestial wisdom.

The central motif of "Lux Aeterna" is an all-seeing eye encased within a radiant sun, embodying the idea that spiritual enlightenment illuminates our entire being and allows us to perceive the most profound truths. The sun is adorned with a clockwise spiral, which symbolizes Zanoni's journey through time and evolution, while the wisdom he gains along the way is ingrained within.

Beneath the radiant sun lies an inverted crescent moon, interlinked with the sun, signifying the duality of knowledge and the necessity to delve both into the depths of darkness and the realms of light. The crescent's points curl at the ends, forming the shape of a chalice - a vessel to hold the acquired wisdom.

The sigil's peripheries are adorned by seven serpents surrounding the central composition. These serpents represent the seven Kabbalistic principles described in Lytton's book "Zanoni." Each serpent is connected to a radiant star, signifying their relationship to the celestial bodies and the divine spark within each entity.

Lastly, the entire emblem is encircled by a continuous Ouroboros - the eternal snake devouring its tail. This representation of life's cyclic nature serves as a reminder that the pursuit of knowledge is endless in the course of human existence.

In conclusion, "Lux Aeterna" is a sigil that encapsulates the mystical essence of Bulwer Lytton's literary works, particularly "Zanoni," through a dance between symbolic representation and esoteric keenness. The sigil stands as a testament to the ceaseless and passionate journey towards spiritual enlightenment and invites seekers to unravel the arcane wisdom concealed within Lytton's profound musings.
