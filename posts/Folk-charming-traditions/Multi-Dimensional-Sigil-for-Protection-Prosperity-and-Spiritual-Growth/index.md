To create a multi-dimensional sigil that incorporates a variety of symbols and talismans from diverse folk charming traditions, we'll need to begin by selecting symbols for specific intentions: protection, prosperity, and spiritual growth. I have chosen five different symbols that hold multiple layers of meaning, originating from various cultural backgrounds and traditions.

1. **Pentacle (Protection)**: The pentacle is a five-pointed star enclosed within a circle, often associated with Wicca and Neopaganism. It symbolizes the five elements (earth, air, fire, water and spirit) and represents protection as well as a balance between the material and spiritual worlds.

2. **Triskele (Spiritual Growth)**: The triskele, or triple spiral, is a Celtic symbol that signifies the three realms - land, sea, and sky - and the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. This symbol represents spiritual growth, evolution, and progress on one's spiritual journey.

3. **Hamsa (Protection)**: The Hamsa is a talisman from the Middle Eastern and North African traditions. It resembles an open hand with an eye within, representing protection against the Evil Eye. The Hamsa is a powerful symbol for warding off negativity and psychic attacks.

4. **Runes (Prosperity & Balance)**: I will include the rune Fehu, associated with wealth, prosperity, and fulfillment, and the rune Jera, symbolizing harvest, balance, and the natural cycles of the universe. By combining these two runes, we invoke abundance and balance in the sigil.

5. **Ouroboros (Continuity & Transformation)**: The ouroboros is an ancient Egyptian symbol depicting a serpent eating its own tail, representing eternal return and the cycle of life and death. This symbol promotes transformation, spiritual growth, and the continuity of existence.

The sigil design:

1. Start by drawing a pentacle in the center.
2. Surround the pentacle with the triskele, intertwining the spirals with the points of the pentacle.
3. Draw the Hamsa surrounding the triskele and pentacle, with the eye positioned at the top point of the pentacle.
4. Integrate the runes Fehu and Jera into the design by drawing them within the open spaces of the Hamsa's fingers.
5. Finally, encircle the entire design with the ouroboros serpent, using a rich golden color to emphasize its transformative nature.

Color correspondences and numerology:

1. **Red**: Associated with protection and passion. Color the pentacle red to enhance its protective qualities.
2. **Green**: Represents growth and prosperity. Color the triskele green to enhance its connection to spiritual development.
3. **Blue**: Symbolizes protection and truth. Color the Hamsa blue to improve its protective power.
4. **Silver and Gold**: Represent abundance and wealth. Use these colors for Fehu (silver) and Jera (gold) runes.
5. **Purple**: Associated with transformation and spirituality. Color the ouroboros purple to emphasize its transformative nature.

Hidden meanings and messages (decoded):

1. The number of spirals in the triskele, 3, signifies the tripartite nature of existence and the cycles of life.
2. The five points of the pentacle, multiplied by the three serpents of the triskele, create the number 15, symbolizing spiritual growth, manifestation, and abundance.
3. The combination of the Fehu and Jera runes represents the phrase "wealth earned through perseverance leads to balance and harmony."

Overall, this multi-dimensional sigil combines symbols and intentions from different traditions to support protection, prosperity, and spiritual growth in an intricate and powerful design.
