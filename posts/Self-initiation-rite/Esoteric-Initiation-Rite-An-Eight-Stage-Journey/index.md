In order to synthesize an eight-stage self-initiation rite that invokes elements of various esoteric traditions and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of archetypal symbolism and its congruence with psychological and spiritual development, we must first establish the foundational framework drawn from diverse traditions and incorporate the principles of alchemical transformation in each stage. The use of example scenarios and metaphors will aid in explicating the concepts for each stage.

1. Purification (Eastern and Western Mysticism):
The first stage involves purification of the body, mind, and soul, reminiscent of the concept of "catharsis" in Greek mysticism and the Vedic concept of "saucha". This process encompasses practices such as meditation, fasting, and rituals of cleansing to remove impurities and create a blank canvas for the subsequent stages. Here, the essence of alchemical transformation lies in purifying the starting materials.

**Example**: An initiate may undergo a period of fasting and meditation, while also performing ritual bathing to cleanse the physical body.

2. Awakening (Kabbalah and Kundalini Theory):
The second stage represents the awakening of the individual's inherent spiritual energy. This stage draws parallels between the Kabbalistic concept of the Sephirot and the Kundalini theory found in Tantra. The awakening is the activation of the spiritual energy centers (chakras) within the individual, thus setting the stage for the internal alchemical transformation.

**Example**: Practicing specific meditation and yoga techniques that aim at awakening the dormant Kundalini energy at the base of the spine, while studying the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.

3. Illumination (Gnosticism and Hermeticism):
In this stage, the initiate embarks on obtaining wisdom and knowledge through inner illumination. Drawing from Gnostic and Hermetic principles, the individual cultivates insight through contemplation, gnosis, and understanding the interconnectedness of all things.

**Example**: The initiate may study ancient texts and symbols that encode esoteric teachings, like the Corpus Hermeticum or the Nag Hammadi library, to grasp more profound knowledge of the universe.

4. Confrontation (Jungian Psychology and Shamanic Healing):
Here, the initiate confronts the shadow aspects of their inner psyche, echoing Carl Jung's work on the shadow self and the process of integrating it into the conscious mind. This stage incorporates aspects of shamanic healing by addressing unresolved traumas and negative patterns.

**Example**: The initiate might participate in rituals like Ayahuasca or Iboga ceremonies to face their subconscious fears and traumas, leading to the integration of the shadow self.

5. Reshaping (Alchemy and Taoism):
With a newfound understanding of the self, the initiate begins reshaping the internal structure and energy pathways. This stage involves transmuting base qualities into higher spiritual energies, resonating with the principles of both Alchemy and Taoism.

**Example**: Combining practices of Neidan (Internal Alchemy) and time spent in nature to harmonize the energies within and connect with the natural world.

6. Synthesis (Rosicrucianism and Theosophy):
The sixth stage focuses on the synthesis of knowledge, wisdom, and experience, based on the principles of Rosicrucianism and Theosophy. The initiate assembles their understanding of reality from multiple perspectives, fostering an inclusive and holistic worldview.

**Example**: Delving into the philosophical writings of figures like Helena Blavatsky, along with studying the Rosicrucian manifestos to glean insights from various cultural and spiritual sources.

7. Aspiration (Mystical Christianity and Sufism):
As the initiate moves towards spiritual enlightenment, this stage encourages cultivating a deep sense of devotion, longing for reunion with the Divine, and aligning with Divine Will. Inspired by Mystical Christianity and Sufism, love becomes the driving force for spiritual growth.

**Example**: Embracing practices such as prayer, contemplative meditation, and chanting the 99 names of Allah (Sufism) to foster a deep connection with the Divine.

8. Transcendence (Buddhism and Vedanta):
The final stage marks transcendence, where the initiate transcends dualistic concepts, realizing the unity of the individual consciousness with the cosmic consciousness. Both advanced Buddhist and Vedanta philosophies stress the importance of transcending the cycle of birth and death and the illusion of separateness.

**Example**: Practicing Samadhi meditation in the style of Vedanta or exploring Mahamudra and Dzogchen practices in Tibetan Buddhism to achieve genuine transcendence and non-dual awareness.

In conclusion, this eight-stage self-initiation rite combines elements from various esoteric traditions, emphasizing archetypal symbolism and congruence with psychological and spiritual development. The rite encompasses purification, awakening, illumination, confrontation, reshaping, synthesis, aspiration, and transcendence, guiding the individual through a transformative journey that culminates in the realization of Oneness with the Divine.
