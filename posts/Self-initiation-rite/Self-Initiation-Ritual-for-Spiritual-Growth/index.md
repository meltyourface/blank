To begin the personalized Self-initiation rite, incorporating the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) and integrating specific symbolism and tools aligned with your spiritual beliefs, follow the steps outlined below. Ensure that you maintain a focused and meditative mindset throughout the ritual to allow for complex exploration and amplification of your spiritual energy.

1. Preparation:

Choose a dedicated, sacred space where you can perform the ritual without disruption. Cleanse and purify the space, releasing any negative energy. Ensure that you have all the necessary tools and elements required for the ritual, including a consecrated athame, candles, incense, and any other symbols or tools that correspond to your spiritual beliefs.

2. Setting the Circle:

Stand in the center of your sacred space, facing east. Take a few deep breaths and visualize a white, protective light surrounding your body. Hold your athame in your right hand, and draw a circle around you clockwise, starting and ending in the east. As you draw the circle, recite a prayer or invocation that resonates with your spiritual beliefs, asking for protection and guidance during the ritual.

3. Lighting the Elemental Candles:

Place four candles at the cardinal points of the circle, with each candle representing one of the classical elements (air in the east, fire in the south, water in the west, and earth in the north). Light each candle as you recite an appropriate invocation specific to each element, requesting their presence and assistance in the ritual.

4. Invocation of the Divine and the Archangels:

Standing in the center of your circle, raise your right hand, holding the athame, and point it upwards to the sky. Call upon the divine and the archangels, invoking their names and requesting their presence, protection, and guidance during the ritual. 

5. Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP):

Perform the LBRP with reverence and total focus. Trace the Banishing Earth Pentagram in each cardinal point, starting in the east and moving clockwise around the circle. As you trace each pentagram, channel the corresponding elemental energy into it, imbuing it with the power of air, fire, water, or earth. After tracing each pentagram, thrust your athame into the center and intone the appropriate divine name. For example, in the East, intone "YHVH" (Yod Heh Vav Heh).

6. Elemental Invocations:

Invoke each of the elements in turn, starting in the east and moving clockwise around the circle, calling upon the specific energies and influences of each element to aid in your self-initiation. Recite a prayer or invocation that captures the essence of each element, asking for their presence and assistance in the ritual and your spiritual journey.

7. Affirmation of Intent:

Stand in the center of your circle, and affirm your intent for the Self-initiation rite. State your purpose clearly and with conviction, believing in your ability to achieve spiritual growth and transformation. Ask for guidance and support on your path from the invoked divine forces and elements.

8. Meditation:

Take some time to meditate on your intentions and the energies that have been invoked during the ritual. Allow yourself to feel and be open to any messages or insights that may come to you during this time. Give thanks to the divine forces for their support and guidance, and express gratitude to the elements for their presence and assistance in your self-initiation.

9. Closing:

To close the ritual, reverse the process of the LBRP. Trace the Banishing Earth Pentagram in each cardinal point, starting in the east and moving counterclockwise around the circle, releasing and thanking each of the invoked energies. Then, extinguish the elemental candles, starting in the north and moving counterclockwise around the circle. Express gratitude to the divine forces and the archangels for their guidance and protection during the ritual. Finally, release the circle by cutting it with your athame, saying a prayer, or invoking a specific phrase to end the rite.

After completing the ritual, take the time to reflect on your experience, noting any insights, messages, or emotions that came up during the process. Remember that self-initiation is an ongoing journey, and you may continue to experience insights, growth, and transformation as you continue on your spiritual path.
