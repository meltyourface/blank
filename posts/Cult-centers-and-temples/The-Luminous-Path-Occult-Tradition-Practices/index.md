### VIII. Sample Glossary Entries
1. Azura (noun) - ["uh-ZUR-uh"] - The Goddess of the Azure Sky, representing intellect, communication, and travel. The etymology of the word can be traced to 'azure', a shade of blue associated with the sky. In The Luminous Path, Azura is invoked for rites involving clarity of thought and passage between realms.
2. Prism Sigil (noun) - ["PRIZ-uhm SIJ-əl"] - A symbol that represents the unity of the seven colors within The Luminous Path, sacred to the practitioners of this tradition. It is often used in rituals dedicated to invoking divine power or manifesting specific intentions. Derives from the combination of 'prism' (a transparent object that refracts light, creating a spectrum of colors) and 'sigil' (a magical symbol).
3. Lustration (noun) - ["luh-STREY-shən"] - A purification process utilized in The Luminous Path, typically performed before magical workings. The term has its origins in the Latin word 'lustratio,' meaning a purifying ceremony. Lustration removes energetic impurities from a practitioner's body, mind, and spirit, allowing them to better align with divine forces.
