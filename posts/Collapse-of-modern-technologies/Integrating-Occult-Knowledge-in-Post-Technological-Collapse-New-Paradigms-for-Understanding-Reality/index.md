To fully comprehend and address the knowledge challenge, it is vital to understand the key concepts and background information. The challenge requires us to consider the potential collapse of modern technologies, the resurgence of occult practices, and how their integration could create a new paradigm in understanding reality. Furthermore, we will explore the implications of this paradigm shift on communication, power dynamics, and our perception of time.

Before diving into the possible influence of a post-technological collapse society fused with pre-modern occult knowledge, let us define the basic parameters. Occult practices involve knowledge and arts said to grant hidden, often supernatural or magical powers to its practitioners. These practices have ancient origins and have been sources of fascination and fear throughout history. 
On the other hand, modern technologies refer to the advancements that have shaped our current societies, including the various means of communication, transportation, and economy that we depend on today. The potential collapse of these technologies could result from multiple factors, such as global catastrophes, economic meltdowns, or cyber-attacks.

Now, to tackle the given challenge:

1) The new paradigm in understanding reality:

In a post-technological collapse world, a resurgence and fusion of pre-modern occult knowledge could provide a new framework for understanding reality. As modern technology's convenience and accessibility are no longer available, people would seek alternative ways of perceiving and processing information.

Occult practices typically involve esoteric symbolism, hidden meanings, and abstract concepts, which can facilitate a deeper understanding of our existence. By combining elements from both pre-modern occult knowledge, such as myths and metaphysical principles, and post-collapse human experience, this new paradigm would foster a more intuitive, reflective, and interconnected worldview. 

2) Implications on the nature of communication:

With the collapse of modern technologies, traditional modes of communication would become either obsolete or exceedingly difficult to maintain. In this context, the fusion of pre-modern occult knowledge could create alternative channels for sharing information. Occult practices often incorporate telepathy, clairvoyance, and astral travel, which might emerge as valuable tools for overcoming communication barriers.

In addition, esoteric symbolism and a more profound connection to nature could influence the way people express themselves verbally, artistically, or even spiritually. As a result, communication would likely become more metaphorical, personal, and transcendent.

3) Implications on power dynamics:

The fusion of pre-modern occult knowledge and post-technological collapse societies would likely result in a significant shift in power dynamics. Since occult practices tend to emphasize personal transformation, spiritual development, and the mastery of hidden forces, individuals adept in these fields would likely gain considerable influence over others.

As modern institutions and hierarchies collapse, new power structures would form, specifically ones that prioritize occult knowledge, spiritual abilities, and mental prowess. Additionally, those proficient in wielding the supernatural forces associated with occult practices could employ them for various purposes, including healing, protection, or control over other entities.

4) Implications on the perception of time:

Time perception might also profoundly change in a world where occult practices regain prominence. Occult beliefs often emphasize the cyclical nature of time and consider this a crucial factor in comprehending cosmic events and individual destinies. While modern society generally revolves around linear time, a post-technological collapse infused with occult knowledge would prompt individuals to focus on the rhythm of natural cycles, astrological phenomena, and historical patterns.

This shift in perception would likely encourage people to seek deeper connections with their past and future selves, understanding that their lives are part of a larger tapestry woven through time.

In conclusion, the fusion of pre-modern occult knowledge and post-technological collapse societies could create a new paradigm that allows for a deeper understanding of reality and our place within it. This perspective shift would have significant implications on our modes of communication, redefining power dynamics and altering the perception of time, leading to a more intuitive, interconnected, and spiritual existence.
