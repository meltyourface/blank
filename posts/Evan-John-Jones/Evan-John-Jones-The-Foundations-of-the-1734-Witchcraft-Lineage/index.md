The 1734 Witchcraft Lineage is a contemporary, initiatory, and mystic Witchcraft tradition that has been named after its purported inception date. This lineage is an amalgamation of practices, folklore, and ideologies with a key philosophical foundation focusing on the significance of personal experience. The enigmatic figure of Evan John Jones is deeply connected with this tradition, popularizing it and enriching its core principles.

Evan John Jones was born in 1936 in England and grew up with a strong connection to the land and its folklore. Throughout his life, Jones believed in the power of the old ways and the importance of magic in everyday life. His journey into the realms of witchcraft and the occult began when he came across Robert Cochrane, a well-known figure in the British Witchcraft movement. Cochrane, born in 1931 as Roy Bowers, claimed to have belonged to a family with witchcraft traditions that dated back to the year 1734.

Jones initiated into Cochrane's coven in 1962 and was mentored by Cochrane, who admired his practicality and deep-rooted reverence for the traditional ways. Jones soon became a key figure in the coven and the wider witchcraft community. Under the teachings of Cochrane, Jones absorbed the foundational concepts and practices of the 1734 Witchcraft Lineage, which drew upon Celtic, Welsh, and English folk beliefs, Gnostic mysticism, and esoteric symbolism.

Upon Cochrane's death in 1966, the coven disbanded, and Jones retreated to personal practice. However, in 1969, he connected with an American, Joseph Bearwalker Wilson, who sought knowledge about Cochrane and his teachings. Jones shared his understanding of Cochrane's system of witchcraft with Wilson, which led to the spread of the 1734 Witchcraft Lineage across the Atlantic.

Some fundamental tenets and practices of the lineage include:

1. **Connection to the land and nature**: Practitioners of the 1734 tradition draw their power and magical abilities from the land and the spirits of nature. They recognize the sacredness of the environment and stress the importance of preserving and honoring the Earth.
  
2. **Personal experience**: The 1734 Lineage emphasizes the centrality of personal experiences, gnosis, and intuition in an individual's spiritual journey, acknowledging that each person's path to knowledge is unique and that dogmas should not be blindly accepted.

3. **Ancestral veneration**: Those within the lineage pay homage to their ancestors, recognizing the power that resides in ancestral connections, wisdom, and protection. They maintain that spiritual power can be accessed through these lineages and effectively applied in their magical workings.

Evan John Jones' role in the development and perpetuation of the lineage was vital as he bridged the gap between the founder, Robert Cochrane, and the next generation of practitioners, especially in the United States. Jones not only shared the teachings with Joseph Bearwalker Wilson but also collaborated with him on various written works, such as "The Roebuck in the Thicket," "Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed," and "Sacred Mask, Sacred Dance." These works outline the philosophies and teachings of the lineage, ensuring its continuity and further growth.

In conclusion, Evan John Jones played a pivotal role in preserving and propagating the 1734 Witchcraft Lineage, sharing his knowledge and experience with subsequent generations. He was essential in shaping its philosophies, practices, and development over time while emphasizing the importance of personal exploration and connection to the land. Jones' enduring legacy within this lineage and the occult community attests to his expertise, commitment, and profound understanding of the esoteric and mystical.
