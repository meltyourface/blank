  Introduction:
  
  In order to evaluate the influence of Evan John Jones on the methods and practices of modern Traditional Witchcraft, it is important to first establish the context in which his contributions were made. Jones was a prominent figure in the latter half of the 20th century, who helped to shape the modern understanding of Traditional Witchcraft. He was closely associated with notable figures such as Doreen Valiente and Robert Cochrane, and had an influential role in the formation of Clan of Tubal Cain. This answer will take into consideration each of these aspects, as well as the shifting perceptions and criticisms surrounding Jones' work.
  
  Collaborations with Doreen Valiente and Robert Cochrane:
  

Jones had initially been introduced to Robert Cochrane in 1963 and became a close collaborator of his over the years, culminating in their work together in the founding of the Clan of Tubal Cain. Under Cochrane's mentoring, Jones developed a deeper understanding of Traditional Witchcraft and helped develop several key rituals and practices. This collaboration informed much of Jones' work within the sphere of witchcraft, which in turn influenced many practitioners who followed, including the aforementioned Doreen Valiente.

Formation and Impact of Clan of Tubal Cain:

The Clan of Tubal Cain, formed by Robert Cochrane and strongly influenced by Evan John Jones' leadership, served as a nexus for the dissemination of witchcraft knowledge and ritual practice. Drawing inspiration from diverse sources, such as the Qabalah, pagan mythology, and folkloric magic, the Clan of Tubal Cain provided a framework for the practice of Traditional Witchcraft that was separate from the more widely known Gardnerian Wicca.

Jones' input in the formation of the Clan was significant, as he continued to expand upon Cochrane's work during his magisterial tenure. Under Jones, the Clan focused on the use of inner-plane work, ritual practice, and the cultivation of personal gnosis. By doing so, it offered an alternative approach to contemporary pagan spiritual practice, emphasizing the importance of direct personal experience and the use of intuitive wisdom.

Impact on Contemporary Paganism:

Jones' work within the Clan of Tubal Cain, along with his collaborations with Valiente and Cochrane, played a crucial role in shaping the development of modern Traditional Witchcraft. His contributions introduced new elements to the craft, including a set of potent, streamlined ritual techniques. These techniques stood in contrast to the ceremonial complexity that characterized other contemporary witchcraft traditions.

Additionally, Jones' influence extended beyond Traditional Witchcraft alone, impacting contemporary paganism as a whole. Through his emphasis on personal experience and inner-plane work, Jones offered a blueprint for a less dogmatic, more individualized spirituality.

Shifting Perceptions and Criticisms:

Over the years, Jones' work has faced various criticisms, largely due to the influence of other pagan currents on his beliefs and practices. Critics argue that the syncretic nature of the Clan of Tubal Cain's teachings dilutes the authenticity or value of Traditional Witchcraft. Additionally, with the passage of time and the influence of multiple other magisterial hands within the Clan, some argue that Jones' contributions may no longer be as relevant to contemporary practice.

Conversely, proponents of Jones' work argue that his syncretic approach and flexible framework incorporate the resilience and adaptability necessary for the survival of Traditional Witchcraft in the face of an ever-changing world.

**Conclusion**:

Evaluating the influence of Evan John Jones on the methods and practices of modern Traditional Witchcraft reveals a complex and multi-layered impact. Through his collaborations with Doreen Valiente and Robert Cochrane, his role in the formation and development of the Clan of Tubal Cain, and the consequences of that work on contemporary paganism, Jones emerges as a formidable figure in the witchcraft tradition. While shifting perceptions and criticisms persist, it is inarguable that he played a pivotal role in shaping the modern spiritual practice of witchcraft, both within the Clan of Tubal Cain and more broadly within the pagan community.
