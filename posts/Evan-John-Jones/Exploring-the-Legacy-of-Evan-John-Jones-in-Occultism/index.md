## Evan John Jones - Life, Insights, and Contributions

Evan John Jones (1936â€“2003) was an influential figure in the realm of modern occultism, esoteric knowledge, and witchcraft. A dedicated practitioner and teacher, Jones had a profound impact on the development and understanding of contemporary magical practices. His associations with renowned occultists like Robert Cochrane and Doreen Valiente shaped his work and life, allowing him to leave an indelible mark on the field.

Biographical Overview

Born in Staffordshire, England, Jones' early life was deeply rooted in ancient British folklore, which helped cultivate his fascination with the occult. As a young man, he served in the military and went on to become a Royal Marine. It was during this time that he first encountered traditional witchcraft, blending elements of these practices with his pre-existing knowledge of folklore and esotericism.

In the 1960s, Jones met Robert Cochrane, and the two developed a close friendship. Together, they were instrumental in the development of what is now known as Cochrane's Craft, a non-Wiccan form of witchcraft that draws from British folk traditions and esoteric concepts. Jones continued the tradition after Cochrane's death in 1966, eventually collaborating with Doreen Valiente, a prominent witch and writer. This collaboration led to the establishment of a group known as the Coven of the Clan of Tubal Cain, which continues to operate today.

Major Works and Teachings

Evan John Jones was a prolific writer in the fields of occultism and witchcraft, authoring books and articles that examined the complex rituals, beliefs, and history of the esoteric world. **Among his most significant publications are**:

1. **Witchcraft**: A Tradition Renewed (1990) - Co-authored with Doreen Valiente, this work serves as a practical and theoretical guide to Cochrane's Craft, providing readers with resources for understanding and practicing this unique form of witchcraft. The book contains rituals, tenets, and historical context that allow for a comprehensive introduction to the tradition.

2. **The Roebuck in the Thicket**: An Anthology of the Robert Cochrane Witchcraft Tradition (2001) - A collection of essays, correspondences, and rituals by Jones, Cochrane, and others involved in the Cochrane's Craft. It provides an insider's view of the tradition's development and offers insight into the practices and beliefs that constitute its core.

3. Sacred Mask, Sacred Dance (2002) - Drawing on his experiences with ritual and performance, Jones explores the intersection of witchcraft and ancient rites of transformation. He introduces readers to the concept of the "sacred mask," which he believed held transformative powers and offered means to access spiritual realms.

4. The Shadow of Tubal Cain (2003) - Jones' final work, published posthumously, explores the origins of the magical tradition he inherited from Cochrane, delving into the roots of the Clan of Tubal Cain and examining how this particular form of witchcraft evolved and adapted over time.
