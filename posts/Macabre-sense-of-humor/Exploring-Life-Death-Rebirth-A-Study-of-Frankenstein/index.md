The 19th-century literary work that reflects a macabre sense of humor, while utilizing the themes of both reincarnation and palingenesis to artistically showcase the cycle of human existence, is Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus" (1818). Although not a traditional example focusing solely on reincarnation and palingenesis, the novel delves deep into the reanimation of life from physical remains, challenging existing beliefs on life, death, and rebirth. Simultaneously, "Frankenstein" explores the relationship between the grotesque physical form and the metaphysical planes.

To provide deeper understanding, it's important to define key concepts here: reincarnation refers to the rebirth of a soul or spirit in a new body after death, while palingenesis denotes the idea of regeneration or rebirth in a more general sense, which may encompass ideas like resurrection and reanimation.

"Frankenstein" is primarily a cautionary tale against interfering with the natural order of life and death. The protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, goes against the boundaries of nature and society when he creates a grotesque creature from various human remains with the intention of reanimating and bringing it to life. This act exhibits a macabre twist on both reincarnation and palingenesis, as instead of a soul entering a new body, Frankenstein's creature is a conglomeration of various body parts brought together into a grotesque, unnatural form.

This exploration of the grotesque physical form and its connection to the metaphysical plane is evident in the creature's initial quest for knowledge and understanding, which reflects the idea of spiritual rebirth. The creature, despite its grotesque appearance, possesses a sense of innocence and yearning for acceptance from its creator and society. As it develops a consciousness and understanding of the world, the creature begins to grapple with complex emotions, showcasing its inner humanity despite its monstrous exterior.

Using the creature as a metaphor, "Frankenstein" invites readers to question the boundaries between life, death, and rebirth, and consider how these interconnected states affect one's perception of identity and morality. The novel serves to remind us of the inherent dangers of attempting to reanimate life, as well as passing moral judgment on a being based on its physical appearance.

To summarize, Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" artistically explores the themes of reincarnation and palingenesis to showcase the cycle of human existence. The novel daringly examines the relationship between the grotesque physical form and the metaphysical planes, impelling readers to confront assumptions about the boundaries between life, death, and rebirth. Key themes in "Frankenstein" include the ethical boundaries of scientific inquiry, the responsibility of the creator to its creation, and the significance of empathy and understanding in addressing questions of moral judgment.
