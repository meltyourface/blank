  Attributes and Historical Narratives of Astaroth, Belial, and Asmodeus
  
  Astaroth, Belial, and Asmodeus are all significant figures within the realm of demonology and occult practices. They are often mentioned in various grimoires and are prominent figures in the Goetia, the first section of the Lesser Key of Solomon, where they are classified as the 29th, 68th, and 32nd spirits, respectively. 
  
  Astaroth, also known as Astarot or Ashtaroth, is described as a great and powerful duke with the appearance of a hurtful angel, riding on an infernal beast-like dragon and carrying a viper in his right hand. He is said to teach and provide knowledge on various subjects such as liberal arts, sciences, and secrets. Additionally, Astaroth is known to grant his summoner power and influence over others.
  
  Belial is another powerful demon, who is described as both a king and a lord in various texts. He is often depicted as a two-headed angel with a human-like face and a serpent-like face. Additionally, Belial is said to be the emissary of Satan and is associated with deceit, treachery, and falsehoods. He is incredibly persuasive and teaches individuals to manipulate others to gain power.
  
  Asmodeus, also known as Asmoday or Asmodai, is a king and mighty demon with the ability to transfer his summoner across vast distances immediately. He is depicted as a dragon holding a lance and banner, accompanied by other demonic servants. Asmodeus has wide-ranging knowledge of mathematics, geometry, astronomy, and other subjects. He is also known for his abilities to manipulate people through lust, particularly in marriage.
  
  Commonalities, Contrasts, and Complexities
  
  The first similarity among these three demons is their association with knowledge and education, providing their summoners with insights on various subjects. However, the focus of their expertise may vary: Astaroth provides knowledge of the liberal arts, sciences, and secrets; Belial focuses on deceit and manipulation; and Asmodeus encompasses math, geometry, and astronomy.
  
  Another common feature is their position within the demonic hierarchy: they are all powerful demons that either possess the status of Duke or King. Interestingly, while all three are equally powerful, they have distinct roles in the demonic society.
  
  In terms of contrast, their appearances are unique: Astaroth appears as a hurtful angel, Belial is a two-headed angel, while Asmodeus is depicted as a dragon. Additionally, each demon utilizes different methods to accomplish their goals, such as Astaroth's influence on others, Belial's deceit, and Asmodeus' manipulation of lustful desires.
  
  Designing an Original Ritual for Synergistic Summoning
  
  To create a transformative experience for the summoner through synergistic summoning, the following ritual can be designed:
  
  1. Begin by crafting a protective circle to contain the energies of the demons and protect the summoner from harm. This circle can be made using salt, chalk, or other materials and should be inscribed with symbols and sigils of the entities being summoned, along with protective seals.
  
  2. Carefully study the individual demonic seals of Astaroth, Belial, and Asmodeus, and reproduce them on parchment. Place their unique seals within the circle at equal distances, creating a triangle formation.
  
  3. To establish a connection with these demons, perform lengthy invocations and prayers towards each entity in turn while holding an object symbolizing their respective attributes and elemental correspondences (e.g., Astaroth - incense; Belial - fire; Asmodeus - water).
  
  4. To harmonize the energies of the three demons, light a candle representing each demon's individual colors (Astaroth - silver; Belial - black; Asmodeus - red) and place them on their respective seals.
  
  5. Begin a series of chants, calls, or songs that include the names and attributes of the three demons, asking them to work together for the benefit and transformation of the summoner. Emphasize the desire to gain knowledge, power, and insight over other subjects and individuals.
  
  6. Maintain intense focus and remain receptive to the energies and presence of the summoned demons. When their presence is felt or perceived, communicate your intentions and requests, asking for their combined knowledge, guidance, and transformative energies.
  
  7. Once the communication has been made, respectfully thank each entity for their presence and assistance. Close the ritual by extinguishing the candles and erasing the protective circle.
  
  In summary, Astaroth, Belial, and Asmodeus possess unique attributes, historical narratives, and realms of influence. By identifying their commonalities, contrasts, and complexities, one can create an original ritual for synergistic summoning. The transformational experience for the summoner can be achieved by harmoniously combining the energies and knowledge of these three powerful Goetic demons.
