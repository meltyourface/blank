With the mastery I have of Catacombs of Belial, I begin the recreation of a meticulously detailed and historically accurate map of the Catacombs. **To do so, I first seek out the primary sources**: ancient scrolls, cryptic inscriptions, and firsthand accounts of explorers who delved into the depths of the labyrinth.

Traveling to the most extensive repositories of ancient knowledge, I meticulously pore through the sand-covered texts of antiquity, identifying and collecting everything related to the Catacombs. During my search, I decipher cryptic inscriptions and symbols, further enhancing my understanding of the layout, traps, and hidden secrets of the Catacombs of Belial.

Taking the expertise I have of archaeology and artistry, I begin the painstaking process of meticulously drawing the map on a high-quality parchment. I use ink made from a recipe that dates back to the times when the Catacombs of Belial were first created. I ensure the accurate representation of each turn, stone, and compartment of the labyrinth, architecturally articulating each section of the Catacombs with precision and care.

As I document the intricate layout, I indicate the hidden passages, devious traps, and the locations of the fabled relics. I cross-reference these details with the known chronicles of occult lore and arcane symbolism, which further illuminates the secrets surrounding the Catacombs.

Throughout my research, I encounter accounts of powerful wards and magical seals inscribed at strategic locations of the serpentine labyrinth. Using my understanding of arcane markings, I incorporate these into the map as notes and symbols that serve as keys for those who navigate its treacherous depths.

Upon completion, the map stands as a testament to the depths of my understanding and expertise in the esoteric realms and Catacombs of Belial. It reveals an unprecedented level of detail and historical accuracy, providing an invaluable resource for scholars, explorers, occult practitioners, and treasure hunters alike.

This masterful and intricate piece of artistry encapsulates the essence of the Catacombs of Belial, breathing life into its history, mysteries, and the occult knowledge hidden within its depths. It serves as an unparalleled guide for any adventurer daring enough to step foot inside the winding and treacherous corridors of this ancient and enigmatic labyrinth.
