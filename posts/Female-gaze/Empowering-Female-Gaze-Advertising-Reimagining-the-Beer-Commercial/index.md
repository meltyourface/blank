Deconstruction of the traditionally male-gaze advertisement:
Let's take a good example of a male-gaze advertisement. A classic example would be a beer ad featuring a bikini-clad woman holding a beer bottle while seductively staring at the camera. The ad objectifies the woman and aims to sell the product by linking it to sex appeal. The woman is depicted as a mere accessory or prize, there to make the beer seem more appealing to the male audience.

Reconstruction with a female-gaze perspective:
To reconstruct the advertisement with a female-gaze perspective, we will focus on empowerment, emotional connection, and respect for the woman as a subject. Instead of objectifying the woman's body, we can showcase her strength, intelligence, and resilience, as well as emphasizing her own autonomy and desirability as an equal partner.

Step 1: Empowerment and Respect:
We can change the setting and situation, showing the woman not as a passive subject but as an active participant in her environment. For example, she could be enjoying a cold beer at a conference she's speaking about sustainable brewing practices. She's dressed professionally and holding a beer confidently, making direct eye contact with the camera. This changes the image from one that objectifies her to one that empowers her and portrays her as successful and knowledgeable.

Step 2: Emotional Connection:
Rather than focusing on her physical appearance, we can focus on the multi-faceted aspects of her personality. The advertisement could show various snapshots of her life including work, hobbies, and moments with friends or family. We could highlight her role as a CEO, activist, or philanthropist and include images of her mindfulness routine, playing an instrument, and engaging in sports or physical activities.

Step 3: Depth and Complexity:
By delving into the subject's psychological aspects, body positivity, and shared experiences, we add depth and complexity to the ad. Accompanying the images could be testimonials from various women who have had positive experiences with the product, showcasing the power of community and shared interests. Furthermore, the advertisement can include people of different sizes, shapes, colors, ages, and life experiences to emphasize body positivity and representation.

Final Result:
The reconstructed advertisement now focuses on the empowerment and respect of the woman, with an emotional connection to the product that resonates with a wider female audience. The ad has shifted from overtly sexual to aspirational, illustrating a modern woman who is strong, confident, and connected with herself and her community. The beer is an accessory to her life, enjoyed when she chooses to indulge, without attaching her worth to her appearance, emphasizing the female gaze as a powerful and thoughtful lens in advertising.
