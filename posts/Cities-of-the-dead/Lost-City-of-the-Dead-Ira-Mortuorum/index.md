## Ira Mortuorum – The Wrath of the Dead

Location: Hidden within the dense Fogwood Forest that shrouds a mysterious island, lies the ancient City of the Dead— Ira Mortuorum. 

Overview of the Layout:
Surrounded by stone walls, the city is divided into four primary sectors. Clockwise from the north: The Necropolis, The Charnel Grounds, The Elysium Fields, and The Ossuarium. A dark river yet to be named silently flows, dissecting the city diagonally, from the northeast to the southwest. At its center stands the Atramentum Tower, casting an ominous shadow. 

1. The Necropolis:
In the northeastern sector, countless elaborate tombs and mausoleums pay tribute to deceased royalty and the elite. A small island within the once sacred river hosts a large, haunted mausoleum of Emperor Acherus— plagued by the restless spirits of those who were wronged in his reign.

Markers and Artifacts:
- 'The Tomb of the Celestial Twins' holds the Starcaller Scepter
- A mural of a great battle with the inscription, "In memoria pugnae in caelum contra fallaces umbrae."

Supernatural Phenomena:
- The Weeping Lady's Crypt, where ghostly cries and whispers are commonly heard.

2. The Charnel Grounds:
Southwest of the Necropolis, the Charnel Grounds hosts common graveyards and unmarked, shallow graves. It is known for curses and vengeful spirits roaming around in search of peace.

Markers and Artifacts:
- The Dragger's Crypt, housing the cursed Crimson Book of the Dead
- An ancient statue of a blindfolded figure, The Judge of Souls

Supernatural Phenomena:
- The Wailing Tree, where spirits of the unavenged lament their fate.

3. The Elysium Fields:
To the northwest lies the Elysium Fields, where cremations were held on massive, ceremonial pyres. The ashes of the revered were scattered on the fields, merging with the earth and growing into otherworldly flora.

Markers and Artifacts:
- 'The Altar of Ashes' bearing the inscription, "Per cinerem ad astra, e vita aeternae. (Through ashes to the stars, from life to eternity)"
- A Fading Crown, hidden in the roots of a great silver tree

Supernatural Phenomena:
- The Watcher's Grove, which has close ties to the spirit world.

4. The Ossuarium:
To the southeast are the vast catacombs, ossuaries, and crypts of the Ossuarium. The subterranean network contains a labyrinth of structures built with bones and skulls.

Markers and Artifacts:
- A hidden chamber below the floor, the Sanctum Macabre, harbors the Resurrectionist's Chalice
- The Circle of Souls: a forbidden alcove with an inscribed sigil, "Ira mortuorum iniquis luctu."

Supernatural Phenomena:
- An apparition called the "Keeper of the Bones" for his vigil on the catacombs' entrance.

Conclusion:
Stemming from historical findings and deciphered inscriptions, Ira Mortuorum was an ancient city devoted to the afterlife and the arcane. Its inhabitants aimed to appease spirits' wrath and grant them eternal rest, while those who dared to harness power from dark artifacts faced the ultimate price.

The intricate cartography of Ira Mortuorum and the documentation of unearthly phenomena, significant landmarks, and mysterious artifacts further our understanding of its arcane heritage. Thus, this newly discovered lost City of the Dead will leave a remarkable mark in the annals of history and the studies of the esoteric and occult.
