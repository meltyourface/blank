In the context of Cities of the Dead as esoteric, multidimensional realms, the necropolis designs and architectural layouts found in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Persia, and China are symbolic and interconnected through a number of key components, such as their burial practices, shared cultural symbolism, and the metaphysical significance attached to the structures themselves. By examining these commonalities, we can gain a deeper understanding of how these civilizations perceived the eternal nature and evolution of the soul in its journey between realms of existence.

Firstly, it is important to understand that the necropolis designs in these ancient civilizations were not only physical locations but also held multidimensional significance. They were believed to serve as portals or gateways between the physical plane and the spiritual realm, allowing the deceased an easier passage into the afterlife. This is evident in their cultures’ burial practices, which often involved elaborate rituals and ceremonies meant to guide the soul on its journey. 

In ancient Egypt, for example, the pyramids were designed to align with celestial bodies, specifically the stars that represented the path to the afterlife. The bodies of the deceased were mummified, and their tombs were filled with various items of significance, such as protective amulets, meant to help them navigate and overcome challenges in the afterlife. Similarly, the Persians held the belief that the deceased's soul would be weighed and judged upon death, leading to their Zoroastrian practice of sky burial. In China, the deceased were buried with terracotta armies, intended to protect and guide them through the spirit realm.

Another interconnected aspect of these necropolis designs is the shared symbolism across cultures. The use of protective and guiding deities or symbols in these necropolis layouts demonstrates a universal recognition of the importance of spiritual protection in the journey between realms. In Egyptian necropolises, this is exemplified by the presence of various protective gods and goddesses, such as Anubis, the god of embalming and the afterlife. Similarly, in Chinese necropolises, guardian statues and stone animals were placed to ward off evil spirits and guide the deceased. These shared depictions of protective figures and symbols might point to a common understanding or experience related to the soul's journey after death.

The metaphysical significance of these necropolises is also demonstrated by the monumental nature of their architecture. From the grand pyramids of Egypt to the sprawling Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor in China, the scale and complexity of these structures indicate the importance of preparing and commemorating the deceased for their passage into the afterlife. Furthermore, these necropolis layouts often incorporate geometric patterns and mathematical principles associated with cosmic harmony and divine order. By constructing such harmonious and balanced necropolises, these civilizations may have believed that they could manifest or (re)create spiritual realms suitable for the souls of the deceased.

In conclusion, the necropolis designs and architectural layouts in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Persia, and China are symbolic and interconnected through a variety of shared burial practices, cultural symbolism, and their metaphysical significance. These practices demonstrate a mutual understanding of the eternal nature and evolution of the soul and the importance of guiding and protecting it as it journeys between realms of existence. By studying the designs of these Cities of the Dead, we can glean deeper insights into the spiritual beliefs that have persisted throughout human history and may hold valuable lessons on the nature of existence, death, and the soul’s eternal journey.
