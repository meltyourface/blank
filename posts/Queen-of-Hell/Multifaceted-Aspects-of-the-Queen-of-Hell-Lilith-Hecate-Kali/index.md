The combination of titles and correspondences that demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the Queen of Hell includes Lilith from Babylonian mythology, Hecate from Greek mythology, and Kali from Hindu mythology. Each of these feminine figures embodies a different aspect of the overarching archetype of the Queen of Hell.

Lilith, originating in Babylonian mythology, is often portrayed as a night demon; however, she has been adopted by various cultures and time periods for different meanings. Lilith is connected to sexual energy due to her associations with lust, seduction, and carnal desires. Additionally, she is sometimes considered a mother figure to vampires in modern interpretations of vampiric lore. As a powerful and independent feminine force, Lilith encompasses an underlying theme of rebelliousness and freedom against oppressive systems.

Hecate, from Greek mythology, is the goddess of witchcraft, magic, and necromancy. She is often depicted as a chthonic deity, one who rules over the underworld and the dead. Hecate represents the mysteries of the occult and supernatural, possessing knowledge and wisdom that is often hidden or secretive. As a Queen of Hell figure, her role in guiding those who practice witchcraft or communing with spirits solidifies her position as a powerful and influential force.

Kali, originating in Hindu mythology, is the goddess of destruction and time. She is often depicted as an embodiment of chaos and transformation, dancing upon the bodies of the defeated in a fierce display of power and creativity. Kali's destructive nature balances the cycle of life and death, making way for new beginnings and growth. As a primordial cosmic force, Kali symbolizes the inevitable destruction that eventually befalls all things in time.

**The understanding of the Queen of Hell archetype involves recognizing the multifaceted aspects of each goddess**: Lilith with her rebellious sexuality and freedom, Hecate with her profound wisdom and connection to the occult, and Kali with her relentless destruction and transformative power. Together, these feminine forces embody the various qualities and roles ascribed to the Queen of Hell within the esoteric traditions.
