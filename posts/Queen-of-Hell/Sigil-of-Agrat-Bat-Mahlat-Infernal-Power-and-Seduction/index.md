Sigil Design: 

At the center of the sigil lies the "Vehuel," an ancient symbol that resembles a twisted dance and represents Agrat Bat Mahlat's connection to the Dance of the Demons. From this symbol, four lines emerge, one for each direction. The first line points upwards to a crescent moon, denoting her connection to darkness and seduction. The second line points downwards to the "Hagallaz" rune, symbolizing destruction and chaos. The third line extends to the left, connecting with the "Thurisaz" rune which represents dark powers and sorcery. Finally, the fourth line reaches right to the "Algiz" rune, alluding to her protective and nurturing nature toward her demonic followers.

Interconnecting these four key components of the sigil, you can find looming around the borders a serpent biting its tail, otherwise known as the "Ouroboros". This powerful symbol represents the perpetual cycle of life, death, and rebirth that Agrat Bat Mahlat governs within her reign.

As a final touch, the sigil is enclosed within a circle of fire, signifying Agrat Bat Mahlat's infernal influence upon those who dare to harness her power.

**Backstory**:

The sigil was created eons ago by the dark sorceress Aradia, who sought to strengthen her own dark powers by forming a pact with Agrat Bat Mahlat. Aradia knew that a mere incantation or ritual would not suffice; thus, she ventured into the depths of Hell to gather the knowledge and materials necessary to create such an intricate sigil. It took Aradia decades to complete her work, but her determination fueled by the promise of unrivaled power never waned.

Effects and Purpose:

This powerful sigil contains within it the essence of Agrat Bat Mahlat's dominion. When invoked, it channels the dark energies of the demoness summoning her presence and power. The ritual must be executed with the utmost precision, as any deviation could result in catastrophic consequences for the practitioner.

Upon the successful employment of the sigil, the user gains knowledge of seduction and dark sorcery, wielding a potent power that can bend mortals and even lesser demons to their will. It can also invoke the Dance of the Demons, a malevolent force capable of causing destruction, chaos, and turmoil within the realm of the living. Finally, drawing upon Agrat Bat Mahlat's protective nature, the sigil encompasses the caster in a shroud of infernal energy, shielding them from enemies or other harmful forces trying to breach their defenses.

While undoubtedly powerful, this sigil holds a cost to its user. Balancing the demoness's power is both challenging and draining, requiring great sacrifice and devotion. The ongoing constant manipulation of the sigil's influence may lead to the gradual corruption and ultimate consumption of the wielder's soul.
