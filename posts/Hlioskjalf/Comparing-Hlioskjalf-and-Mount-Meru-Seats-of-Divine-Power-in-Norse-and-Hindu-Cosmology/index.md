Answer:
In order to fully respond to this knowledge challenge, I will first compare and contrast the symbolic role of Hlioskjalf within the realm of the Norse pantheon to the Mount Meru in Hindu cosmology, as a similar seat or location of power found in another esoteric tradition. Following this comparison, I will analyze the potential implications and practical applications of such an archetype in the process of self-discovery and spiritual awakening. 

Hlioskjalf, in Norse mythology, is the high seat of the chief god, Odin, from which he gains the ability to observe all realms. Dwelling in Asgard, the abode of the gods, Hlioskjalf represents not only the pinnacle of divine authority and a source of all-encompassing wisdom, but also serves as a strategic location for Odin to monitor emerging threats and ensure the well-being of his domains. Symbolically, Hlioskjalf exemplifies the interconnectedness between knowledge, power, and divine responsibility, embodying the notion that true wisdom requires both vast perspective and an ongoing commitment to maintaining balance in the cosmos.

In Hindu cosmology, Mount Meru, also referred to as Sumeru, is the cosmic axis that connects the spiritual and physical realms. It is the center of all creation, linking the divine, human, and demonic domains. Representing a cosmic pillar of immense power, Mount Meru is revered as the golden mountain in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain myths. It is believed that the gods of the Hindu pantheon live on its apex, while the world below functions in perfect harmony with its divine mandate. Comparable to Hlioskjalf, Mount Meru symbolizes both the spiritual hierarchy of being, the source of divine sustenance, and the unyielding bond that ties all of existence together.

Both Hlioskjalf and Mount Meru are significant in their respective traditions as seats of divine power, with a central role in the cosmology and myths that surround them. However, they differ in the sense that Hlioskjalf is exclusive to one deity, Odin, while Mount Meru is shared by multiple gods and represents a hierarchical structure.

Now, addressing the potential implications and practical applications of such archetypes in the process of self-discovery and spiritual awakening, we can explore these symbols as useful gateways in aligning oneself with qualities associated with the divine. Just as Odin's Hlioskjalf confers immense knowledge and wisdom, an aspirant in the path of spiritual awakening may strive to heighten their awareness in pursuit of understanding, embracing the importance of observation, insight, and balanced judgment.

In a similar fashion, the archetype of Mount Meru as a cosmic axis can inspire spiritual aspirants to cultivate an inner connection with the divine, to perceive their own consciousness as the bridge between material and spiritual realms. By aspiring to be like the gods who dwell on Mount Meru, individuals can integrate attributes such as resilience, compassion, and divine purpose into their lives.

In conclusion, the symbolic role of Hlioskjalf in Norse mythology and Mount Meru in Hindu cosmology share key themes such as divine power, knowledge, and the link between cosmic realms. While they have unique attributes, both locations serve as pivotal seats of power within their respective traditions. The lessons found in these archetypes can open doors for spiritual seekers to embrace self-discovery, wisdom and grow in their journey toward enlightenment. By internalizing the qualities represented by these symbols, individuals may enrich their lives with greater meaning and purpose.
