The fusion of traditional witchcraft with ceremonial magic.

Andrew Chumbley was a British occultist, writer, and practitioner of traditional witchcraft, best known for his influential writings, which synthesized various strands of magical tradition and practice. Chumbley's work primarily centers around the fusion of traditional witchcraft with ceremonial magic. This theme is evident in his writings and the formation of his magical tradition known as the Cultus Sabbati. 

Chumbley's focus on integrating diverse elements of magical and esoteric systems within a traditional witchcraft framework is a reflection of the broader trend toward syncretism and eclectic practice within modern occultism. Among his influences are Robert Cochrane's Clan of Tubal Cain, Austin Osman Spare, Michael Bertiaux, and the Golden Dawn tradition. 

In his book "AzoÃ«tia: A Grimoire of the Sabbatic Craft," Chumbley details the practices of his magical tradition, placing an emphasis on an initiatory path that draws from a wide range of sources. The system he describes is rooted in the Wiccan and modern witchcraft traditions, particularly with regard to the use of ritual tools, the structure of the magical circle, and a focus on the balance of masculine and feminine energies. However, Chumbley also infuses his witchcraft with Thelemic symbolism, Enochian magic, and other strains of ceremonial magic. 

One concept that features prominently in Chumbley's work is the idea of the "dual-faith observance," which combines the rites of the Sabbatic Craft with those of other magical systems in a syncretistic manner. He believed that each practitioner could adapt their magical practice according to their own inclinations and affinities, tailoring it to suit their personal spiritual journey.

This emphasis on eclectic practice and innovation reflects the wider movement within contemporary occultism away from a strictly prescribed dogma, in favor of a more individualistic and experimental approach. Chumbley's work can be seen as an important contribution to this trend, bridging the gap between traditional witchcraft and the broader world of Western esotericism.

In conclusion, Andrew Chumbley's writings and practices explore the fusion of traditional witchcraft with ceremonial magic, highlighting the connections and synergies between these two seemingly disparate streams of magical practice. This central theme both exemplifies and influences the broader currents of syncretism and innovation within the modern occult milieu.
