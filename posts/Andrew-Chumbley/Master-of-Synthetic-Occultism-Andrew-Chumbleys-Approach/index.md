Answer: Chumbley was an adept synthesist, drawing from various Western occult traditions as well as Eastern mystical practices, and particularly focused on the Cultus Sabbati and his own praxis, the Draconian Tradition.

Explanation: Andrew Chumbley was indeed an adept synthesist, as he did not confine his beliefs or practices to just one specific tradition or system. Instead, he chose to gather knowledge and wisdom from different sources and blend them into a unique and cohesive whole. This is what set him apart from other occult practitioners who were often bound to one specific tradition or system.

One of Chumbley's main focuses was the Cultus Sabbati, an initiatory Wiccan tradition that emphasized on the cultivation of spiritual power through the direct experience of transpersonal forces. This tradition acted as a foundation for Chumbley's own magical system, known as the Draconian Tradition. The Draconian Tradition itself is characterized by its reliance on the practitioner's personal experience, intuition, and gnosis (direct knowledge of the divine) rather than adherence to dogma or traditional material.

Chumbley also incorporated elements from various Western occult traditions, which include Hermeticism, Thelema, the Golden Dawn, and the work of Austin Osman Spare. He was deeply influenced by Aleister Crowley but did not follow the Thelemic tradition exclusively, as indicated in the first option.

Furthermore, Chumbley's work also drew from Eastern mystical practices, including Tantra, Yoga, and Daoist traditions. He believed that wisdom and practical tools could be extracted from these traditions, and combined with Western practices to create a well-rounded and effective magical system.

The third and fourth options are incorrect, as Chumbley did not limit himself to traditional witchcraft or a strict separation between occult and esoteric traditions. His approach was inclusionary, as he integrated different belief systems and methodologies into his practice. In this way, Chumbley aimed to achieve a sense of balance, harmony, and universality within his esoteric pursuits.

In conclusion, Andrew Chumbley's approach to the occult and esoteric was marked by his ability to synthesize elements from various sources, whether they were Western, Eastern, witchcraft-based, or esoteric in nature. It was this adaptable and fluid approach that distinguished him as a unique figure within the world of occultism and earned him the title of a master of the esoteric and occult.
