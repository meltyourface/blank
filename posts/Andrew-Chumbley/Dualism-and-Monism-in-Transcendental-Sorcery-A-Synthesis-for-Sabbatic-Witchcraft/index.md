To fully comprehend the relationship between dualism and monism in the context of Andrew Chumbley's concept of "Transcendental Sorcery" as described in the book 'Azoëtia: A Grimoire of the Sabbatic Craft,' we must first delve into the foundational concepts and principles that constitute this unique and intricate form of Western esotericism. 

As we dissect Chumbley's teachings, we will delve into the core concepts of dualism and monism, illuminate their role and relevance within the larger framework of Sabbatic Witchcraft, and ultimately demonstrate how the synthesis of these ostensible opposing ideologies serves as the bedrock for the praxis of the Sabbatic Craft.

At its core, dualism posits that reality exists within two fundamental, contrasting aspects. This concept has manifested in various forms and cultural contexts, spanning from the well-known yin and yang of Taoism to the more esoteric dualities found in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life within Western mysticism. Essentially, dualism is based on the premise that opposites hold the key to understanding reality, and through embracing these disparities, we can awaken to deeper insights into the nature of our existence.

Monism, in contrast to dualism, maintains that reality is ultimately derived from a single source or principle rather than being built upon disparate polarities. Various forms of monism have emerged throughout history in philosophical and religious contexts, including materialism, idealism, and pantheism. Monism tends to emphasize unity, oneness, and a holistic approach to understanding reality.

In 'Azoëtia,' Chumbley presents the Sabbatic Craft as a transcendental form of sorcery that uses the dialectical tension between dualism and monism to unlock the hidden potential within oneself. According to Chumbley, the Sabbatic Witch walks between the worlds of dualistic and monistic understandings of reality, embracing polarities such as light and darkness, spirit and body, male and female, and the compass and square. By simultaneously incorporating dualism as a map of the cosmos and monism as the foundational principle, Chumbley envisions an approach to magick that surpasses traditional limitations, tapping into the mystical and transformative potential that is inherently ours to wield.

To illustrate the interplay of these principles, let us plumb the depths of a familiar archetype—the Witches' Sabbath. The Witches' Sabbath represents a liminal space wherein mundane reality intersects with the numinous realm. It is at this crossroads that dualistic energies (e.g., masculine and feminine, human and non-human) merge, intensifying the power of ritual and creating a centrifugal force that initiates can harness to propel their magick. In other words, the harnessing of dualistic energies actualizes a monistic source, exemplifying the synthesis of dualism and monism within the praxis of Sabbatic Witchcraft.

In conclusion, it becomes apparent that Andrew Chumbley's concept of "Transcendental Sorcery" as described in 'Azoëtia: A Grimoire of the Sabbatic Craft' finds its foundation in the synthesis of dualistic and monistic principles. The interplay of these two seemingly contradictory ideologies allows for the creation of a unique form of magick that transcends conventional boundaries. By utilizing the power of both dualistic energies and a monistic understanding of the universe, practitioners of Sabbatic Witchcraft can effect transformative change and tap into oft-unexplored dimensions of human potential.
