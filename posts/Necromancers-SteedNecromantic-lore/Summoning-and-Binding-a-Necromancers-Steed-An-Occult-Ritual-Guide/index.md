## The Necromancer's Steed – Summoning and Binding a Spectral Ally to Enhance Your Powers

### I. Introduction

The Necromancer's Steed has been a significant aspect of Necromantic lore for centuries, enhancing the mobility and power of those who have mastered the art of summoning a spectral ally. A powerful tool in a necromancer's arsenal, this steed – often appearing as a horse-like apparition – can traverse great distances swiftly and boundlessly, conferring increased agility and speed upon its rider. In this section, we will delve into the intricate process of summoning and binding a Necromancer's Steed while also exploring the associated risks, historical background, and prominent figures in this occult tradition.

### II. Rituals and Materials

To successfully summon and bind a Necromancer's Steed, the aspiring necromancer must conduct a series of precise rituals and gather essential materials. 


A. Materials:

1. Ritual Circle - This must be drawn with a combination of human bones and powdered grave dust. Ensure the circle is large enough to accommodate the summoned steed and the caster. 

2. Candles - A total of thirteen black candles must be placed equidistantly around the ritual circle, representing the veil between the mortal realm and the spectral plane. 

3. Incense - Fragrances involving ingredients such as wormwood, mugwort, or yew must be burned, to attract the attention of spectral entities.

4. Offerings - A container of fresh blood from a recently slain animal must be presented, signifying the life force which will subsequently be transferred to the summoned steed.

5. Obsidian or bone dagger - This tool will be used to mark the binding sigil upon the steed once summoned.


B. Ritual Process & Summoning Incantation:

1. Prepare the ritual space – Ensure the area is cleansed and free of potential distractions. Draw the ritual circle using the materials mentioned above.

2. Light the candles and incense – Arrange these items around the circle and set them alight.

3. Perform the Invocation of Shadows – This step initiates the connection between the necromancer and the Spectral Plane, summoning the desired entity into the mortal realm. Chant the summoning incantation:

_"Oh spirits of the nether realm,
Dark riders of the spectral plane,
Hear my call from this mortal frame,
Bring forth the steed to serve my reign."_


4. Present the blood offering – Once the incantation has been spoken, the Necromancer's Steed should begin to manifest in the circle. At this point, offer the blood to the summoned spirit.

5. Inscribe the binding sigil – While the steed remains in the circle and accepts the offering, swiftly inscribe the binding sigil on its spectral form, using the obsidian or bone dagger. This will bind the steed to the necromancer.

### III. Potential Risks

Summons of this nature inherently carry risks that the aspiring necromancer must acknowledge. Some of these risks include:

1. Failure to bind the steed - Incomplete or inaccurate inscription of the binding sigil may lead to the steed's refusal to serve, and could even result in the summoner's death.

2. Unwanted attention - Summoning such a powerful entity might attract the attention of other malicious or opportunistic entities.

3. Loss of control - Improper control or mistreatment of the allied steed can lead to it turning against the summoner.

### IV. Historical Background & Prominent Figures

The history of the Necromancer's Steed derives from ancient practitioners of necromancy who sought to expand their influence and power in the mortal realm. The first recorded instance of a spectral steed was in the journal of Thraindrekel the Shadowrider, a feared necromancer who ruled a vast territory during the Dark Era. Since then, numerous prominent necromancers have held command over these spectral allies, solidifying the figure of the Necromancer's Steed as a crucial aspect of necromantic lore.

In conclusion, mastery over the summoning and binding of the Necromancer's Steed can lead to both heightened mobility and power for the necromancer. Through careful adherence to rituals and materials, and with a keen awareness of potential risks, the necromancer can enhance their arcane abilities by employing this spectral ally. By no means an undertaking for the inexperienced, this advanced occult practice holds immeasurable rewards for the determined and knowledgeable practitioner.
