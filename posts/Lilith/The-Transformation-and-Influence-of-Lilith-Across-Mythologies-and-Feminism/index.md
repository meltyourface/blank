To analyze and grasp the complexity of Lilith's origins and roles across various mythologies, it is essential to commence with her earliest depictions in ancient Sumerian and Mesopotamian cultures, trace her development through Hebrew traditions, and finally explore her connections to occultism and esotericism. Along the way, we shall untangle her various aspects and attributes, with a particular focus on her independence, rebellion, and darker qualities. Furthermore, these elements would be linked to the growing prominence and relevance of Lilith within the modern feminist movement.

To begin our explorative journey, we must cast our gaze back to ancient Sumerian and Mesopotamian times. It is here that Lilith appears as a dark and enigmatic character in the form of a winged, female demon. She is often portrayed in the company of the storm god Pazuzu, symbolizing her integral link with chaos, natural disasters, and unruly forces. 

Expanding upon this portrayal, we turn our attention to Assyrian-Babylonian mythology, where Lilith is now depicted as Lilitu or Ardat Lili, derived from the term "lil" which refers to the spirits of wind and night. Within this context, she is closely associated with nocturnal and malevolent creatures, often linked to seducing men and harming pregnant women.

As we transition from these early representations to Hebrew tradition, we encounter a pivotal turning point in Lilith's mythological development. Here, she emerges as Adam's first wife, as mentioned in the apocryphal texts such as the Alphabet of Ben Sira (circa eighth to tenth century CE). According to this narrative, Lilith was created simultaneously with Adam, imbuing her with an innate sense of equality. This sparked tension between the two, especially when Adam demanded her submission during sexual encounters. Unwilling to acquiesce, she utters the ineffable name of God and flees the Garden of Eden.

This crucial moment in Lilith's story marked the beginning of her transformation into an archetype of independence and rebellion. Furthermore, it also honed her darker qualities, as she became synonymous with demonic entities and succubi who preyed on men and their offspring. Such characterizations were likely fueled by patriarchal societies seeking to demonize empowered, self-determined women.

This lens of independence and rebellion segues perfectly into Lilith's role within occultism and esotericism. Often seen as a symbol of transformation, she has become a potent figure in the left-hand path, representing breaking societal and religious norms. This connection is well exemplified by the Order of the Gnosis, a secret society that revered Lilith as the embodiment of sexual liberation and the defiance of dogma.

However, it is essential not to reduce Lilith to a single, monolithic persona, as she encompasses many other aspects. In some mystical parts of Kabbalah, she signifies the dark side of the feminine divine (or Shekhina), indicating she bears a dualistic quality as both a demoness and a divine aspect. This dual nature emphasizes her multifaceted and nuanced existence within mythological and occult traditions.

Finally, we come to Lilith's connection with modern feminism. It is easy to understand why her independent spirit, refusal to submit to the will of man, and unwavering advocacy for true equality would resonate with those seeking gender emancipation. Consequently, she symbolizes a powerful emblem for women reclaiming their authority, autonomy and equal standing, in both spiritual and secular landscapes.

In summary, Lilith's complex origins and roles span multiple cultures and mythologies, transitioning from ancient Sumerian and Mesopotamian origins to Hebrew tradition and eventually occultism and esotericism. Her aspects of independence, rebellion, and darker qualities serve multiple purposes, illustrating the breadth of her character. Ultimately, Lilith becomes a timeless symbol found at the crossroads of myth, legend, and feminist empowerment, continuing to influence and challenge societal norms through her transformative presence.
