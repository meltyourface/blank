To complete this task, we will create an intricate ritual framework customized for a specific malevolent Daemon Servitor and utilize esoteric symbols, vocal incantations, and a deep understanding of its sigil to effectively confront and expel it from the individual's auric field. The following outline will guide the development of this sophisticated ritual.

1. **Initial Assessment**:
Identify the presence of a malevolent Daemon Servitor within an individual's auric field through clairvoyant observation, psychic scanning, or the use of divination tools such as tarot cards or pendulum.

2. **Gathering Information**:
Research and collect information about the target Daemon Servitor's characteristics, vulnerabilities, and modus operandi. Utilize historical texts, journals of other practitioners, or channeled information from higher entities to gain a thorough understanding of the daemon's sigil and significances.

3. **Pre-ritual Preparation**:
a. **Cleanse the ritual space**: Perform a cleansing ritual using purifying substances like sage, frankincense, or saltwater to neutralize unwanted energies.
b. **Set protection barriers**: Establish protective barriers around the ritual space using methods such as casting a circle, calling upon protective deities, or activating specific talismans.

4. **Designing the Ritual**:
a. **Invocation of Higher Powers and Protective Beings**: Connect and invoke benevolent entities, guarding spirits, or angelic presences who can strengthen and support the banishing process.
b. **Incorporate esoteric symbols**: Utilize symbols like hexagrams, pentagrams, solomonic seals, or other significant sigils related to the target daemon to amplify the ritual's potency.
c. **Develop powerful vocal incantations**: Create a set of tailored vocal incantations, either in your native language or the daemon's prefered language, to specifically address, weaken, and neutralize the Daemon Servitor.

5. **Performing the Ritual**:
a. Open the protective circle and invite the individual and supportive entities into the space.
b. Clearly state the intention of the ritual and mentally align your willpower with the desired outcome.
c. Utilize the vocal incantations and esoteric symbols to forcefully confront and overpower the malevolent Daemon Servitor.
d. Utilizing the daemon's sigil and vulnerabilities, command it to leave the individual's auric field, and seal the command with a final banishing gesture, sound, or visualization.
e. Close the circle and sever any remaining connections with the Daemon Servitor.

6. **Post-banishing Restoration**:
a. Perform an energetic healing on the individual to repair and strengthen their auric field, using modalities such as Reiki, Pranic healing, or chakra balancing.
b. Prescribe grounding and shielding techniques for the individual to incorporate into their daily practice, such as visualization, meditation, or using protective crystals.
c. Create a custom talisman imbued with the protective energies of the supporting beings from the ritual, to further fortify the individual's energetic space.

7. **Post-ritual Actions**:
a. Properly dispose of or neutralize any materials used in the ritual that embody the banished energies.
b. Perform a self-cleansing to purify your energy field after the intense ritual.

By incorporating all these steps, the custom ritual will effectively identify, confront, and expel the malevolent Daemon Servitor from the individual's auric field while taking comprehensive precautions to prevent re-entry and enhance their defenses against further invasions.
