In twilight's veil, as shadows dance,
A whispered chant, an arcane trance,
Daemon Servitor, a fable of yore,
Bound by sigils, the keys to the door.

In the occult hierarchy, a cog and wheel,
An ineffable presence, secret truth to reveal,
An astral current, a breath of arcane,
Drawn from the void, as the stars align.

Orisons aged, of forgotten tongue,
Recite the words, to the depths they're flung,
Rich in symbolism, the hallowed hex,
Eye of the storm, the hermetic texts.

In pyres alight, the offering burns,
The scent of myrrh, as the circle turns,
Amidst the runes, which hold their sway,
The Servitor of Daemons, summoned to play.

A specter concealed, a cunning sleight,
Through wisdom and guile, proceed in the night,
Garbed in shadows, a cloak of deceit,
A skillful scribe, signed scrolls at his feet.

The spirit of secrets, a wellspring of knowledge,
Subtle whispers, the Daemon's homage,
Influence vast, unraveled fate,
The grand tapestry, forever in wait.

To the whispering wind, the final decree,
An equilibrium of nature, a cosmic harmony,
The Daemon and Servitor, one within the veil,
In unity, the eternal dance prevails.
