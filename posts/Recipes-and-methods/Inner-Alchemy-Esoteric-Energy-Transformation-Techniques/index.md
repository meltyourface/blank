Central to the practice of inner alchemy is the concept that all beings are composed of different energies â€“ physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. These energies, when mastered and refined, can prove beneficial for personal growth and spiritual evolution. Key symbols employed in inner alchemy include the serpent, a representation of transformation and fertility; the caduceus, symbolizing the balance of energies and divine wisdom; and the philosopher's stone, representing the ultimate goal of transmutation and spiritual perfection.
