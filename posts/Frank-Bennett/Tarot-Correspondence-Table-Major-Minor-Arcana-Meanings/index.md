Minor Arcana:

**Note**: The Minor Arcana cards are divided into four suits: Cups, Wands, Swords, and Pentacles. Each suit is associated with an element (Water, Fire, Air, and Earth respectively), and has numbered cards (Ace to Ten) as well as Court cards (Page, Knight, Queen, and King).

The Minor Arcana cards represent the challenges and experiences we face in daily life. Their meanings are influenced by the Major Arcana cards they're connected to, and they can provide additional insights into the esoteric context of a reading.

For example, the Two of Cups (Water) corresponds to the Lovers, the Four of Wands (Fire) to the Emperor, and the Eight of Swords (Air) to the Strength card.

Due to the vastness of the Minor Arcana cards and their respective esoteric connections, creating a comprehensive table isn't feasible. However, an understanding of the suits' associations with their respective elements and the Major Arcana cards can enable learners to grasp and interpret their meanings and their esoteric contexts.
