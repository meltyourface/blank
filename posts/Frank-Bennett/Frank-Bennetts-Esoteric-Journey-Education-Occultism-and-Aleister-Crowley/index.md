To examine the interplay between Frank Bennett's contributions to education and his involvement in occultism and esoteric practices, particularly in relation to his association with Aleister Crowley, we must first establish the foundational concepts and key figures operative in Bennett's life. In doing so, we will unfold the impact that these relationships had on his personal life and the advancement of occultism in the early 20th century.

Frank Bennett (1877-1955) was an Australian teacher who had a profound influence on education, esoteric practices, and occultism. While he devoted himself to modernizing and creating a more open and liberal educational environment for Australian children, he also deeply immersed himself in the study and practice of esoteric and occult teachings. One of the most influential figures in Bennett's life was British occultist Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), whose intricate system of magical and mystical practices, known as Thelema, attracted Bennett's attention and greatly influenced his work.

To gain a thorough understanding of the intersection between these domains, it is necessary to examine how Frank Bennett's interest in these spheres manifested during his lifetime. One possible entry point lies in Bennett's background as an educator, which provided him with the necessary tools to disseminate esoteric knowledge. His keen interest in educational reform and innovative pedagogical approaches served as a strong foundation upon which to build his study of the occult.

A key aspect of Bennett's involvement in occultism can be traced to his membership in the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), an international organization originally focused on esoteric Freemasonry, occultism, and the teachings of the western mystery tradition. Bennett joined the OTO in 1914 and was initiated into the order by none other than Aleister Crowley himself, later becoming the Australian Grand Master of the OTO, a clear indication of their close relationship.

During his time within the OTO, Bennett came into close contact with several of Crowley's works, particularly his seminal book, The Book of the Law, which contained the core teachings of Thelema. This close relationship allowed Bennett to meld his educational skills with the esoteric teachings of Thelema, enhancing his understanding and practice of occultism.

For instance, we might imagine a scenario in which Bennett, using his background in education, would create didactic materials about Thelema for OTO members, thereby facilitating the spread of esoteric knowledge and contributing to the growth of occultism during this time.

In order to assess the impact of this intersection on Bennett's personal life, we must take into consideration his friendships with influential figures in both the fields of education and occultism. His connection to Crowley, a controversial figure with a penchant for shocking the bourgeoisie with his libertine lifestyle, undoubtedly resulted in some controversy. However, Bennett's reputation as an educator and intellect allowed him to navigate these potentially treacherous waters with relative ease.

Furthermore, it is important to note the wider context of esoteric practices in the early 20th century. The era saw the rise of spiritualism, societal acceptance of alternative belief systems, and the emergence of various occult orders and organizations. Bennett's association with Crowley and involvement in the OTO played a significant role in shaping the esoteric landscape in Australia, especially through the establishment of the Australian OTO lodge.

In conclusion, the intersection of Frank Bennett's contributions to education and his involvement in occultism, specifically through his encounters with Aleister Crowley, was profoundly influential in both his personal life and the advancement of esoteric practices in the early 20th century. By combining his educational prowess with his keen interest in occultism, Bennett was able to make a significant impact on the field of esoteric knowledge. His connection with figures such as Crowley allowed him to navigate the sometimes contradictory realms of occultism and education and ultimately leave a lasting legacy on both the educational system in Australia and the global esoteric community.
