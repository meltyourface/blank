In order to design and create an intricate ceremonial robe that closely adheres to Frank Bennett's esoteric principles and occult knowledge regarding ritual attire, we will take into account the importance he placed on symbolism, color correspondences, and incorporating various designs throughout the garment. The final robe will not only honor Bennett's philosophy but also serve as an aesthetically captivating interpretation of his teachings on ritual attire.

Materials:

1. Pure silk fabric in deep indigo as the base for the robe, representing spiritual power and psychic abilities.
2. Gold and silver embroidery thread to create various astrological glyphs, runic designs, and other esoteric symbols.
3. A variety of small gemstone beads, such as amethyst, garnet, lapis lazuli, and moonstone, to be incorporated into the embroidery and beadwork for their specific magical properties.
4. High-quality fabric paint in iridescent hues for additional detailing.

Design Instructions:

1. Begin by drafting the outline of a full-length, long-sleeved robe with a wide collar and a sash to be tied securely at the waist. The length of the robe should brush the ground, as to not detract from the wearer's focus during rituals.

2. Embroider a large, intricate Tree of Life motif on the back of the robe, using gold thread to represent divinity and interconnectedness among all living things.

3. Adorn the robe's wide collar with silver embroidery depicting astrological glyphs for each of the twelve zodiac signs, as well as an ornate sun and moon design at the center.

4. On the sleeves of the robe, embroider rows of rune designs and other esoteric symbols in gold and silver, alternating between the two thread colors for a visually compelling pattern.

5. Along the hemline of the robe, use iridescent fabric paint to create swirling patterns representing the flow of spiritual energy.

6. Throughout the robe, incorporate detailed beadwork using various gemstone beads, following the patterns created by the embroidery. Carefully consider the magical properties of each gemstone to ensure they align with the wearer's intentions during ritual practice.

7. Finally, fasten a clasp at the neckline in the shape of a serpent, symbolizing the transformative power of occult knowledge.

The completed ceremonial robe captures the essence of Frank Bennett's esoteric principles and occult knowledge while showcasing an imaginative and aesthetically enchanting interpretation of his teachings on ritual attire. The fusion of various symbolic elements, meticulous embroidery and beadwork, and the thoughtful color palette will be sure to inspire and enrich the wearer's spiritual experience during occult ceremonies.
