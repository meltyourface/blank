In this symbolic expression, I have encapsulated the core principles of the Emerald Tablet within the context of the Secret Elixir, by incorporating specific alchemical concepts and esoteric symbols.

Symbols breakdown:

∞ - The Infinity symbol represents the eternal quest for knowledge, wisdom, and the unending cycles of creation, death, and rebirth in the alchemical process.

Ω - The Omega symbol symbolizes the end goal, representing the Philosophers' Stone, the ultimate completion, and the final stage of the Magnum Opus (The Great Work).

M - The M denotes the Magnum Opus, the ultimate goal of alchemy, and the alchemical transformation of lead into gold, as well as the evolution of human consciousness.

Ō - The Omicron symbol represents the Hermetic Seal, signifying the unification of microcosm and macrocosm, the divine unity of the above and below, and the harmony between the inner and outer worlds.

A - The A symbolizes the first stage of alchemy, the Prima Materia, representing raw chaos and pure potentiality that the alchemist skillfully refines and transforms.

∴ - The three dots arranged in a triangle are the symbol of the Trinity (The Triad), representing the unity of body, mind, and spirit, the three alchemical principles of Sulfur, Mercury, and Salt, and the interdependence of the stages of transformation.

Ś - This stylized S denotes Serpens, the Serpent, which symbolizes the cyclic nature of transformation, as well as the shedding of old ways, skin, and illusions to reveal truth and wisdom.

EL - The Latin word for God, 'Deus', is represented here. It symbolizes the divine gift of sacred knowledge, emphasizing that the attainment of the Philosophers' Stone is a result of both alchemical and mystical efforts.

Δ - Delta, the alchemical symbol for fire, represents transformation, transmutation, and the passionate pursuit of one's true essence and purpose.

Π - The Pi symbol conveys the four elements, Air, Water, Earth, and Fire, which together form the foundation of the alchemical process.

Ή - Eta, the Greek letter, signifies the marriage of opposites, the alchemical stage where dualities are merged, creating balance and harmony.

Σ - The Sigma symbol stands for synthesis, the fusion of alchemical processes and mystical wisdom that manifests the Secret Elixir.

In conclusion, this symbolic expression interweaves the core principles of the Emerald Tablet, alchemical concepts, and esoteric symbolism representing stages of transformation, elementary principles, and the marriage of opposites, to convey the fusion of alchemical processes, mystical wisdom, and the attainment of the ultimate Philosophers' Stone.
