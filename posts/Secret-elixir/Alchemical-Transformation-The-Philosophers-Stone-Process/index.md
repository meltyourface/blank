The alchemical process by which the Prima Materia, or the raw material, is transformed into the Philosopher's Stone is a complex subject that draws from various ancient and esoteric disciplines. In this response, we will explore the sequence of stages involved in this transformation, the role of the secret elixir, its connection to the four elements, as well as the three alchemical principles and the necessary qualities required for achieving inner and outer transmutation. 

1. The Sequence of Stages in the Prima Materia Transformation:

The transformation of the Prima Materia into the Philosopher's Stone involves several stages, which can be broadly categorized into four: nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, and rubedo.

a. Nigredo (Blackening): The first stage during which the Prima Materia, which is said to contain the essence of all life, is decomposed and purified by fire. This stage represents the separation and breaking down of existing structures, both physically and spiritually.

b. Albedo (Whitening): In this stage, the process of purification is taken further. The impurities are filtered, and the purified material is combined with the secret elixir, which acts as the catalyst in the transformation process.

c. Citrinitas (Yellowing): The purified Prima Materia is now ready to enter a stage called fermentation. Spiritually, it symbolizes the development of the individual's higher consciousness, dissolving the ego and connecting to the divine. 

d. Rubedo (Reddening): The final stage, in which the individual achieves a complete state of inner transformation, resembling rebirth. The purified substance is transformed into the Red Stone, the Philosopher's Stone, which represents spiritual enlightenment and physical alchemical gold.

2. The Role of the Secret Elixir:

The secret elixir, also known as the "Alkahest" or "universal solvent," is said to be the key to unlocking the alchemical transformation of the Prima Materia. It is a substance that enhances and accelerates the alchemical process by dissolving and purifying impurities and joining the purified components back together in a new synthesis.

3. Relationship of the Elixir, Alchemical Principles, and the Four Elements:

The secret elixir relates to the three alchemical principles, or the Triad, which consist of Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt, as well as the four elements of fire, air, water, and earth.

a. Sulphur: In alchemy, Sulphur is the principle of heat and fire, representing the active, masculine aspect of nature. The secret elixir contains these qualities when used to purify and transform the Prima Materia effectively.

b. Mercury: As an alchemical principle, Mercury symbolizes fluidity, adaptability, and connection, and is linked to air and water. Its presence in the secret elixir assists with the dissolution and dissolution of impurities during the transformation process.

c. Salt: Salt signifies stability, structure, and persistence, and it is associated with the earth. The secret elixir, bearing this quality, helps in the final stage of solidifying and crystallizing the product of the Philosopher's Stone.

4. Essential Qualities Needed for Inner and Outer Transmutation:

a. Patience and Perseverance: Alchemical transformation requires the individual to undergo a prolonged and arduous process, with no guarantee of success. It is essential to have the patience and perseverance to continue the work, learning from failures and refining oneâ€™s approach.

b. Self-Reflection and Spiritual Growth: The alchemical process is as much about transforming oneself as it is about transforming materials. Thus, the practitioner must be open to self-reflection and strive for spiritual growth in harmony with the physical transformation.

c. Intuition and Inner Guidance: Adept alchemists possess a strong sense of intuition to guide them through their work. This inner guidance comes from an understanding of the interconnectedness between the physical and spiritual realms, allowing the individual to flow with the transformative process.

In summary, the alchemical process of transforming the Prima Materia into the Philosopher's Stone is a complex and intricate journey that involves multiple stages of purification, dissolution, and synthesis. The process is further catalyzed by the secret elixir, with its close connections to the Triad of alchemical principles and the four elements. Ultimately, this process is more than just the physical transformation of base matter into gold; it represents the profound inner transformation of the individual and the attainment of spiritual enlightenment.
