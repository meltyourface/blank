## Guided Practical Sorcery Astral Projection Meditation

[PREPARATION]

1. Set up your sacred space by cleansing the area with incense, like sage or sandalwood, or diffuse essential oils for protection, such as lavender or frankincense. You may also light a white candle to symbolize purity.

2. Choose a comfortable seated or laying down position; ensure that your back is straight and supported if seated. Ensure you wonâ€™t be disturbed during the meditation.

3. Begin by taking deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Visualize a brilliant white light engulfing your entire being, protecting you, and purifying your energy field.

[INITIATION]

4. In your mind's eye, imagine a glowing sigil that represents your intention to astral project. Visualize reinforcing this sigil with your focused intention and energy.

5. Call upon the help of deities or guardians that resonate with you. For example, invoke Archangel Michael for protection, or Anubis for guidance through the astral realm. Silently or aloud, invite their presence and assistance.

[VISUALIZATION]

6. Envision your astral body, a bright, pulsating replica of your physical body that exists within you. Gently start to separate the energy of your astral body from your physical body by gradually expanding and contracting your awareness. With each breath, feel your astral body becoming more distinct.

7. As you become more familiar with the sensation of your astral form, visualize an astral cord, like a lifeline tethering your astral and physical bodies. This cord is indestructible and will ensure your safe return.

8. Choose a method to leave your physical body:

   a. Beginner: Imagine yourself stepping up onto a ladder, climbing higher with each breath. Feel the weightlessness of your astral body as you leave behind the physical world.
   
   b. Intermediate: Visualize your astral body rotating 180 degrees, aligning yourself with a different gravitational pull, causing you to float effortlessly away from your physical form.
   
   c. Advanced: With your full astral awareness activated, will yourself to rise out of your body, and traverse any environment or dimensional plane you desire.

[ASTRAL EXPLORATION]

9. As you journey through the astral plane, become aware of your surroundings. Allow your intuition to guide you, seeking places, beings, or knowledge that serve your spiritual growth. Trust your instincts, and remember your intentions.

10. Engage with entities or deities you encounter, being respectful, and seeking their wisdom. Keep in mind the intention of being protected and guided during this exchange.

[RETURN AND CLOSING]

11. When you're ready to end your astral journey, thank any beings or entities that have assisted you and ask them to guide you back to your physical body.

12. Visualize your astral cord gently pulling your astral body back into your physical form. As you align your astral and physical bodies, feel their connection deepen, grounding you back into your physical reality.

13. Take deep breaths and focus on your awareness, revitalizing your body and mind. When you feel fully present and aware, slowly open your eyes and stretch your limbs.

14. Thank your deities or guardians for their protection and guidance and extinguish the candle. Take a few minutes to reflect on your experience and, if desired, record it in your journal for future reference.

This Guided Practical Sorcery Astral Projection Meditation offers a comprehensive exploration of the astral plane for practitioners of all skill levels. However, remember that such experiences should be approached with seriousness and respect for the powers at work. Practice often and stay true to your intentions for the safest and most enriching astral journeys.
