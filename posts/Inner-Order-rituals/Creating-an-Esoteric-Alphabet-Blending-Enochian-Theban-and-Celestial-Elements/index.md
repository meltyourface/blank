  Devise a novel Inner Order magical alphabet by meticulously analyzing and synthesizing elements from existing prominent magical systems, such as the Enochian, Theban, and Celestial script. Focus on imbuing each character with its own unique esoteric properties and associations, including intricate visual symbols, astrological correspondences, and elemental connections to ensure the alphabet possesses comprehensive and elevated ritualistic applications.

In devising this new Inner Order magical alphabet, let us first briefly examine the existing prominent magical systems and extract elements from them:

1. **Enochian**: The Enochian script is a complex and highly structured magical language, with 21 letters and a comprehensive system of correspondences. It was received by the magicians John Dee and Edward Kelley in the 16th century and has since become an essential component of modern ceremonial magic.

2. **Theban**: Commonly known as the 'Witch's Alphabet,' Theban script is an alphabet used primarily for writing magical inscriptions and for encoding secret texts. The origin of the Theban script is uncertain, but it has been linked to the 16th-century German magus and scholar Cornelius Agrippa.

3. **Celestial**: Also known as the 'Angelic Alphabet,' Celestial script is an ornate and elegant writing system primarily used for inscribing talismans and other magical objects. It is believed to have been devised by the 16th-century English magician and astrologer John Dee, although its origins may be older.

Now, let's synthesize these elements to create our original Inner Order magical alphabet:

**Foundational Structure**: To create a harmonious synthesis, our novel magical alphabet will contain 24 letters. This number represents the balance of the 12 zodiac signs, the 4 elements, and the 8 planets (excluding the Sun and Moon, which are celestial bodies).

Letter-Inspiration: Each letter will incorporate visual elements from the Enochian, Theban, and Celestial scripts, resulting in a distinct and intricate aesthetic.

**Astrological Correspondences**: Each letter will have a unique astrological association, connecting it to one of the 12 signs of the zodiac.

**Elemental Connections**: Letters will be grouped into sets of four, each group pertaining to one of the four elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.

**Planetary Associations**: Lastly, each letter will have a correspondence with one of the eight planets, strengthening their esoteric properties and ritual applications.

**Example**:

1. **Letter A**: The visual design of the A character would combine the angularity of the Enochian script, the curving lines of Celestial, and the connecting bars from Theban. A will be associated with the zodiac sign Aries, the element Fire, and the planet Mars.

Following the same structure, we can design and imbue the entire alphabet with esoteric properties and associations, leading to a comprehensive and cohesive magical system. This new Inner Order magical alphabet will allow practitioners to harness the vibrational essence of the cosmos, infusing their personal rituals with a heightened level of power and intention.
