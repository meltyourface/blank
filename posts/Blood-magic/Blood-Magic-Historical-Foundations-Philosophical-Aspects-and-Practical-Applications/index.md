To comprehensively answer the posed knowledge challenge, let's take a step back and dive into the depths of the origins, key philosophical aspects, and historical components that underpin the fundamentals of blood magic. In doing so, we can examine how these facets intersect to engender the ethical implications and practical applications associated with the practice of blood magic.

1. Historical Roots:
The history of blood magic stretches far back into antiquity, with traces found in diverse ancient cultures such as the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Mesoamericans, and European pagan traditions. Blood, as a symbol of life force and vitality, has consistently been at the center of rituals designed to manipulate and harness power. Whether it be through sacrifices, offerings, or binding spells, blood has been a ubiquitous ingredient in magical practices. Its deep-rooted association with life and death across civilizations has led to the unique characteristics of blood magic that are evident today.

2. Philosophical Underpinnings:
Equally important to the historical background are the philosophical dimensions that ground blood magic. These aspects can be identified in three primary themes:

    a) Vitalism: First and foremost, blood magic operates under the belief that living beings possess an intrinsic life force or 'vital energy' flowing through their bloodstream. By drawing upon this energy, practitioners can tap into a profound source of power and influence, which, when combined with intention, may produce both benevolent and sinister effects.

    b) Connectivity: Blood magic also rests on the notion of connectivity - both interpersonal and metaphysical. The blood of an individual is thought to contain the essence of who they are, connecting them to their ancestors, their kin, and even the environment surrounding them. As a result, the use of blood can forge powerful bonds and create interdependence, which makes blood magic an effective tool in affecting relationships or connections with others.

    c) Balance and Transmutation: The third philosophical theme involves the idea that blood magic practitioners possess the ability to balance and transmute energies. By utilizing the power of blood, practitioners can ostensibly restore equilibrium and stimulate transformation, both within themselves and in the world around them. Through the manipulation of blood, adepts supposedly control the proverbial life and death and thus maintain the harmony between these forces.

3. The Convergence of Historical and Philosophical Components:
Understanding the historical and philosophical foundations is crucial in examining the ethical implications and practical applications of blood magic. The synthesis of these aspects can be seen in two main ways: intentionality and responsibility.

    a) Intentionality: By uniting historical precedent and philosophical beliefs, blood magic practitioners have the opportunity and responsibility to wield this potent force with a clear and focused intention. Whether employing blood magic for healing, guidance, or personal gain, the deliberate use of one's will is pivotal in shaping ethical outcomes.

    b) Responsibility: Strengthened through the historical context and driven by the philosophical principles, blood magic endows practitioners with immense power, which demands an equally significant level of responsibility. As the practice can impact multiple dimensions of existence, including the health and well-being of others, it is incumbent upon those who wield its power to act with caution, discretion, and due consideration of the consequences.

4. Practical Applications:
Given the confluence of the historical and philosophical components of blood magic, the range of potential practical applications is vast. By melding these ideas and principles, blood magic practitioners can tailor their rituals, spells, and intentions to achieve diverse outcomes such as divination, influencing relationships, healing, energizing objects, and other myriad purposes.

In conclusion, blood magic is an esoteric practice rooted in deep historical and philosophical foundations. By understanding and amalgamating these key components, practitioners can harness the power of blood to influence connections, transmute energies, and reach profound outcomes. The convergence of historical and philosophical aspects requires practitioners to not only focus on their intentions but also acknowledge the tremendous responsibility that comes with wielding such power. When properly understood and respected, blood magic can be employed to achieve a wide range of practical applications, limited only by the imagination and ethical boundaries set by its practitioners.
