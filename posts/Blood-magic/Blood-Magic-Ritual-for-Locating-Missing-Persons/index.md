1. List of required ingredients and materials:
- Blood from a close relative or someone with a strong emotional connection to the missing person (minimum 1 ounce)
- Blood from the practitioner (minimum 1 ounce)
- A map covering the last known location of the missing person
- A personal item belonging to the missing person
- Hematite (stone associated with grounding and locating)
- Vessel for mixing blood, ideally made of silver or obsidian
- Athame or ritual dagger
- "Radal" and "Akaash" runes (associated with Blood magic and locating individuals)

2. Layout of sigils and glyphs:
Arrange the following sigils in a circular layout surrounding the map:
- Uruz (strength and accuracy)
- Perthro (secrets revealed)
- Ansuz (communication)
- Teiwaz (guidance)
- Othala (homecoming)

Create a secondary circle by placing the Hematite stones equally around the sigils, which will serve as the grounding element for the ritual.

3. Step-by-step procedure:
a. Cleanse the ritual area and light candles or incense for focus and clarity.
b. Arrange the sigils, Hematite stones, and map in the layout described above.
c. Place the personal item belonging to the missing person in the center of the map.
d. Carve the "Radal" and "Akaash" runes into the ritual dagger, infusing it with Blood magic and locating power.
e. Draw a small amount of blood from the donor with the athame.
f. Draw a small amount of blood from the practitioner with the same athame.
g. Mix both samples of blood in the vessel.
h. Chant the following incantation three times: "Radal und Akaash, leiten mich zu demjenigen, der verloren ist. Enthülle das Verborgene, auf dass wir unserem Ziel näher kommen."
i. Dip the athame into the mixed blood, and then trace a circle around the layout of sigils and glyphs, connecting the energy of the blood to the components of the ritual.
j. Meditate upon the elements of the ritual, focusing on the missing individual and opening yourself up to receiving guidance.

4. Manifestation of results:
As the ritual concludes, the practitioner will receive a vision in which their surroundings will change to reveal the location of the missing individual. The personal item in the center of the map will also become warm to the touch, further solidifying the accuracy of the vision.

5. Accounting for interference or obstacles:
To account for potential interference, build a shielding sigil (such as "Algiz") into the layout, to ward against external energy attempting to disrupt or provide false information.

6. Ethical considerations and minimizing potential harm:
To ensure the ethical use of Blood magic, acquire consent from the blood donor before drawing their blood. Be cautious and sterile while drawing blood from all individuals involved in the ritual, to prevent infection or injury. If the vision reveals the location to be dangerous or inaccessible, be sure to work with authorities or qualified teams to safely retrieve the missing person, not putting anyone at further risk. Additionally, ground any remaining energies after the ritual is complete to avoid any negative consequences to the practitioner or the other individuals involved.
