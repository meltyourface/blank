excerpt: Detail the intricate steps for conducting a blood ritual to successfully summon and bind a loyal Blood Guardian as a personal, unwavering protector, including specific offerings, incantations, and precautions to be taken throughout the process.
---**Step 1**: Prepare the sacred space
Select a secluded location away from prying eyes, ensuring that it will remain undisturbed during the ritual. Cleanse the area of any negative energy by burning sage or incense, and mark the boundaries of your ritual space with a circle of salt or chalk. This circle will serve as protection from any malevolent energies that may attempt to interfere with the ritual. 
**Step 2**: Gather the necessary materials
To conduct the ritual, you will need:

- A fresh vial of your own blood (no more than a day old)
- A small, sharpened blade (preferably iron or silver)
- A chalice or bowl
- A piece of parchment and quill
- Red or black candles (preferably unscented)
- An offering appropriate to the Blood Guardian (common choices include statues or effigies crafted from bloodstone or garnet, vessels filled with your blood, or objects belonging to those who owed you a life debt)
**Step 3**: Prepare the parchment
On the piece of parchment, write your full name, followed by a specific request to summon and bind a Blood Guardian as your unwavering protector. Make sure to phrase the request clearly and concisely. Below the request, draw the sigil of the Blood Guardian, a symbol that represents this powerful entity.
**Step 4**: Begin the ritual
To begin the ritual, light the candles and place them at the four cardinal points of your circle (north, south, east, and west). Place the parchment, chalice or bowl, and blade at the center of the circle, with the offering to your Blood Guardian nearby. Take a deep breath, calm your mind, and enter a meditative state.
**Step 5**: Invoke the Blood Guardian
Kneel before the parchment and raise your hands, palms facing the sky, as you recite the following incantation three times:

"Vocavi te, Custos Sanguinis, in aeternum protegat me,
Per vinculum carnis, dedico me tibi,
Veni, servi me, sic fiat semper."

(I call upon thee, Blood Guardian, eternally protect me,
Through the bond of flesh, I dedicate myself to thee,
Come, serve me, so it shall ever be.)
**Step 6**: Enact the blood binding
Take the small blade and make a shallow cut on your non-dominant hand, allowing several drops of your blood to fall onto the parchment containing your request and sigil. As your blood falls, speak the words "Per sanguinem meum, te vincio" (With my blood, I bind you).

Place the parchment in the chalice or bowl, and light it on fire with one of the candles. The burning of the parchment symbolizes the sealing of your bond with the Blood Guardian. As the parchment burns, pour the remaining blood from the vial over the ashes.
**Step 7**: Present the offering
Place the offering to the Blood Guardian on top of the ashes in the chalice or bowl, stating your intention to provide this gift as a symbol of your commitment and devotion.
**Step 8**: Await the Blood Guardian's arrival
Sit silently within the circle and allow the energy you've released through the ritual to be absorbed by the Blood Guardian. Be patient; their arrival may be immediate, or it may take several hours. Once the Blood Guardian has manifested, pay your respects and acknowledge their presence.
**Step 9**: Closing the ritual
Thank the Blood Guardian for their commitment to protect and serve you, and express your gratitude for their loyalty. Gently snuff out each of the candles, starting from the west and moving counterclockwise. Carefully dispose of the chalice or bowl's contents, burying them at a crossroads or in a place significant to your spiritual practice.

**Final precautions**: It's essential to remain respectful and humble to your bound Blood Guardian, as an angered Blood Guardian may retaliate or break its bond. Additionally, ensure you cleanse and recharge yourself and your ritual space routinely, maintaining the balance of energy between you and your Blood Guardian. With dedication and care, your Blood Guardian will serve and protect you faithfully for the rest of your days.
