Incorporating Mudras and Pranayama:
During your practice, incorporate the following techniques:

1. Mudras: Yoni Mudra - This mudra represents the womb and is thought to connect with the energy of fertility. Perform this mudra by placing your index fingers together and palms facing upward, connecting the tips of your thumbs to form a downward-facing triangle. Rest this mudra on your lower abdomen during Supta Baddha Konasana and Balasana.

2. Pranayama: Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing) - This technique helps balance the body's energy channels and promotes relaxation. Practice this pranayama at the beginning and end of your practice, or during Supta Baddha Konasana and Viparita Karani.

Modifications and Progressions:
As practitioners advance in their practice or come across physical limitations, various props such as blocks, bolsters, and straps can be used to modify poses or provide additional support. Encourage slow and steady progressions, while always emphasizing the importance of listening to and honoring one's body.
