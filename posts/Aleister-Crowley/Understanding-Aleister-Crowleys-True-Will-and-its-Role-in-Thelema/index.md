The best answer is: "The True Will represents an individual's highest purpose, while the motto implies aligning one's actions with that purpose."

In the context of Aleister Crowley's writings and occult practices, the concept of "True Will" and the central motto of his spiritual philosophy, "Do what thou wilt," are deeply interconnected. The True Will represents an individual's highest purpose or innermost calling, while the motto suggests that people should align their actions with that purpose.

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was an English occultist, writer, and ceremonial magician who founded the religious movement Thelema. In Thelema, the True Will is considered to be the deepest, most genuine aspect of a person, their ultimate reason for existence. It is related to the idea of destiny or manifesting one's highest potential.

"Do what thou wilt" is a maxim that appears in Crowley's sacred text, The Book of the Law, which was written in 1904. The full statement reads: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." The intent behind the phrase is not to encourage individuals to indulge in reckless or hedonistic behavior; rather, it advocates for the importance of understanding and pursuing one's True Will, which may differ from surface desires or ego-driven actions.

Crowley believed that the ultimate goal of every individual was to discover and fulfill their True Will. This concept is inspired by various spiritual and philosophical traditions, including the teachings of ancient Egyptian religion, tantric practices from the Hindu and Buddhist traditions, and Western esotericism.

In the context of Thelema and Crowley's works, the True Will is associated with the divine aspect of each individual and the idea of the "higher self." It is believed that through practicing various magical and spiritual techniques, one can gain a clearer understanding of their True Will, aligning themselves more closely with it.

Crowley also emphasized the importance of individualism and personal freedom in his works. He held the belief that each person has a unique path to follow, and they must find their own way in their spiritual journey. By adhering to the central motto of Thelema, an individual can strive towards self-knowledge, spiritual growth, and greater alignment with their highest purpose.

In conclusion, Aleister Crowley's concept of "True Will" and the central motto of his spiritual philosophy, "Do what thou wilt," calls for aligning one's actions with their highest purpose. The True Will is not synonymous with selfish desires or a construct to justify behavior. It represents the core of one's reason for existence and is essential to understanding Crowley's teachings on personal freedom, individualism, and the pursuit of spiritual growth.
