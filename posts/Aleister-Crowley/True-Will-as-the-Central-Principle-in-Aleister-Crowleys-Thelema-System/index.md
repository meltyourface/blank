  - The maxim is a personal directive for hedonism and indulgence, separate from the greater spiritual philosophy of Thelema.

In the context of Aleister Crowley's work in the occult, his development of Thelema and its principles are deeply intertwined with the maxim "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law". This phrase is derived from his 1904 publication "The Book of the Law," which he believed was dictated to him by a higher being named Aiwass. Thelema is an elaborate spiritual system that combines elements of ceremonial magic, Eastern and Western mysticism, Gnosticism, astrology, tarot, and other esoteric disciplines.

The maxim "Do what thou wilt" refers to the underlying principle of Thelema, which is the concept of discovering and fulfilling one's True Will. The True Will is not merely a desire or whim but rather represents the individual's most authentic purpose in life, in harmony with both the individual's own nature and the universal laws of existence.

In Thelema, each person has a unique True Will that guides their actions in the world, and discovering this will should be the primary goal of the individual. This is a process of introspection, self-discovery, and spiritual growth that may involve the study and practice of various esoteric disciplines. The maxim encourages the individual to follow their own path while respecting the similar pursuit of others, and in this way, it serves as the central tenet and guiding principle of Thelema as a whole.

The concept of True Will distinguishes Thelema from other mystical or spiritual systems that might be more focused on asceticism, denial of the self, or adherence to moral codes derived from external authorities.

It is important to understand that "Do what thou wilt" does not promote hedonism or selfish indulgence, as it is sometimes misconstrued. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of aligning oneself with one's innermost nature and following the path that leads to personal development and fulfillment. Thus, the maxim is an expression of Thelema's core philosophy and is inherently connected to the broader framework of spiritual and metaphysical ideas contained within the system.
