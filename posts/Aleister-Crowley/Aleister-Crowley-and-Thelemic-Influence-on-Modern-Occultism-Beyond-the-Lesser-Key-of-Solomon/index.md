The correct answer is: The Lesser Key of Solomon also known as the Goetia.

**Explanation**:

Aleister Crowley, an early 20th-century English occultist, poet, and ceremonial magician, is best known for founding the religious philosophy of Thelema. Thelema is a spiritual path that draws upon a wide range of esoteric and occult influences, including Egyptian Theurgy, Western esotericism, and historical magical practices.

Thelema and its central tenet "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" is a foundational concept in Crowley's teachings. The phrase "Do what thou wilt" refers to the idea that each individual has unique talents and abilities that are part of their True Will, a concept that represents the highest expression of one's innermost nature. The maxim emphasizes the importance of discovering and acting in accordance with that Will.

The Book of the Law is a sacred text within Thelema that Crowley is said to have received through channeled communication with the discarnate entity Aiwass. The Book of the Law serves as a cornerstone to Thelemic philosophy, doctrine, and practice, elaborating on the Law of Thelema and providing guidance for living in accordance with its principles.

The principles of ceremonial magic and the use of ritual to evoke spirits are also part of Crowley's teachings. Crowley was heavily influenced by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an esoteric organization that was instrumental in the development of Western ceremonial magic. He adapted many of their rituals, symbols, and practices as part of Thelema, becoming a prolific and influential figure in modern occultism.

However, the Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as the Goetia, is not directly associated with Crowley's teachings and practices. While Crowley had a keen interest in various grimoires, the Goetia-which was compiled in the mid-17th century and attributed to King Solomon-is a separate work from the body of Crowley's teachings. The Goetia outlines 72 spirits, their sigils, and methods for summoning them in order to achieve various goals.

Though Crowley did write his commentary on the Goetia and create a thorough edition of the text, the Goetia itself remains distinct and separate from his original teachings and practices. It is important to note that while Crowley's works might reference or interact with the Goetia, this does not make the Goetia an integral part of Thelema. Instead, it reflects Crowley's wider exploration of occult traditions in his pursuit of understanding and knowledge.
