To complete this task, I have designed three specialized Thoth Tarot card spreads influenced by the teachings of Aleister Crowley, Thelemic philosophy, and the Tree of Life. These spreads incorporate astrological correspondences and Qabalistic symbolism to create innovative layouts that reveal profound insights during divination sessions.

1. **The Thelemic Star Spread**

This spread consists of 11 cards and is meant to resemble a unicursal hexagram, which is a central symbol in Thelemic tradition. The cards are placed as follows:

- Card 1: The querent's current situation (at the center)
- Card 2: The querent's past influences (top)
- Card 3: The querent's subconscious desires (top-right)
- Card 4: The obstacles faced by the querent (bottom-right)
- Card 5: The querent's conscious thoughts (bottom-left)
- Card 6: The probable outcome (top-left)
- Card 7 through 11: Five influences surrounding the querent (arranged in a pentagram formation around the hexagram)

To interpret this spread, read the cards clockwise from the top, with the surrounding influences being analyzed last. The analysis should incorporate astrological and Qabalistic correspondences related to the cards, for in-depth understanding.

2. **The Tree of Life Spread**

Based on the ten sephiroth from the Qabalistic Tree of Life, this spread involves placing ten cards, each corresponding to the sephiroth they are positioned on. 

The layout from top to bottom:
- Card 1: Kether - The querent's connection to the divine (highest sephirah)
- Card 2: Chokmah - The querent's creative power
- Card 3: Binah - Querent's understanding and wisdom
- Card 4: Chesed - The querent's compassion and generosity
- Card 5: Geburah - The querent's strength and willpower
- Card 6: Tiphareth - The querent's sense of harmony and beauty
- Card 7: Netzach - The querent's emotions and passion
- Card 8: Hod - The querent's intellect and communication
- Card 9: Yesod - The querent's subconscious and intuition
- Card 10: Malkuth - The querent's physical world and everyday life

Each card should be assessed in relation to its corresponding sephirah, and astrological and Qabalistic symbolism should be considered.

3. **The Zodiac Wheel Spread**

This 12-card spread is arranged in the shape of a zodiac wheel. Each card represents one of the astrological houses and reveals subtle aspects of the querent's life.

Starting from the left and clockwise, the cards represent the following:
1. **Self and identity**
2. **Possessions and values**
3. **Communication and learning**
4. **Family and home**
5. **Creativity and pleasure**
6. **Work and health**
7. **Partnerships and relationships**
8. **Shared resources and transformations**
9. **Expansion and exploration**
10. Career and social status
11. Friendships and community
12. Spirituality and inner growth

While interpreting this spread, consider the astrological correspondences and Thoth Tarot card meanings to provide a comprehensive understanding.

In conclusion, these Thoth Tarot card spreads delve into the complexities of Thelemic philosophy and Tree of Life, providing profound insights during divination sessions. Experiment with these intricate combinations and be open to the rich tapestry of meanings present within the Thoth deck.
