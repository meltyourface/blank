Answering this knowledge challenge requires a comprehensive understanding of the context of Aleister Crowley's teachings, as well as an examination of the interconnected elements within his practices – such as ceremonial magic, astral projection, and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. These diverse components come together to form a cohesive system of practices centered around the discovery and realization of one's True Will.

First, let's establish the context of Aleister Crowley's teachings and his impact on Western esotericism. Crowley was a prominent figure in the world of occultism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He had a significant influence on Western esotericism through his writings, teachings, and the development of Thelema – a spiritual philosophy and new religious movement. Thelema emphasizes the primacy of the individual will, encapsulated in the famous phrase, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will."

Aleister Crowley's reinterpretation of traditional occult practices was informed by his exposure to and synthesis of a wide range of esoteric, religious, and philosophical traditions. This eclectic background allowed him to create a unique perspective on various practices within the broader Western esoteric tradition, fusing elements from such diverse sources as Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism.

Ceremonial magic is a key aspect of Crowley's teachings that reflects this synthesis of diverse elements. Ceremonial magic encompasses a wide range of practices, rituals, and techniques aimed at invoking and controlling supernatural forces. In Thelema, ceremonial magic frequently serves as a means to uncover and manifest one's True Will – the ultimate, divine purpose unique to each individual. Crowley's approach to ceremonial magic combines traditional Hermetic and Kabbalistic elements with a distinctly Thelemic focus, providing a framework for the initiate to explore their innermost desires and drives, while connecting to transcendent powers and spiritual currents.

Astral projection, also known as the "out-of-body experience," is another practice that has been incorporated into Crowley's teachings. Through this practice, the initiate seeks to separate their consciousness from their physical body, enabling them to explore the astral plane – a realm of existence thought to be beyond our everyday material world. Crowley believed that astral projection could be used as a tool for self-exploration and a means to engage with spiritual entities, which could lead to insights and experiences that facilitate the discovery and expression of one's True Will.

The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) is a prominent ritual within Western magical traditions, including Crowley's Thelema. This ritual involves the drawing of pentagrams in the four cardinal directions, while invoking the divine names of God and the Archangels. The purpose of the LBRP is to purify the ritual space and the practitioner, allowing them to more effectively engage with magical forces and the exploration of their True Will. The symbolism used in this ritual – including the pentagram itself and the divine names – represents a synthesis of various esoteric streams, including Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Neoplatonism.

In conclusion, Aleister Crowley's teachings and practices are characterized by a profound synthesis of diverse elements from across the span of Western esotericism and beyond. This fusion gives rise to unique interpretations and applications of ceremonial magic, astral projection, and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Each of these practices serves to facilitate the individual's exploration of their True Will, and, when brought together, they collectively provide a powerful framework for the discovery and practical application of one's innermost divine purpose.
