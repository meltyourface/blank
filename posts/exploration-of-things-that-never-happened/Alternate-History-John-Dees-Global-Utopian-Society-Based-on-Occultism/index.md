To begin our exploration of this alternate historical event, let us first establish the context and the key players involved. In this case, the prominent occult figure in question could be someone like John Dee, an influential English mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, and occult philosopher during the Elizabethan era. The major global occurrence that never actually happened could be the establishment of a global utopian society based on esoteric and occult principles, orchestrated by Dee himself through his influence on influential political figures such as Queen Elizabeth I of England.

Now, let us proceed to analyze the potential implications this change would have had on the development and perception of occultism, esotericism, and related fields throughout history while examining the interconnected social, cultural, and political contexts that would have emerged in response to this alternate event.

1. **Development and perception of occultism and esotericism**:

In this alternate timeline, the successful establishment of a global utopian society based on esoteric and occult principles would have led to widespread acceptance and dissemination of such knowledge. Instead of being relegated to the fringes of society, occultism and esotericism would have become mainstream fields of study, with institutions dedicated to their research and education. The teachings of ancient mystical traditions would have been revered, and the wisdom of people like John Dee would have been sought by those in power. This would ultimately lead to a more profound understanding and acknowledgement of the mystical dimensions of human experience in society.

2. **Social implications**:

A society built on occult and esoteric ideals would emphasize the importance of personal transformation, self-discovery, and spiritual growth. Such a society might prioritize the development of individual character and spiritual awareness above material gain or power. This could lead to a shift in societal values, with people focusing on empathy, compassion, and harmony, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all life. Furthermore, scientific exploration would not be perceived as antithetical to the mystical and spiritual dimensions, but rather as complementary fields of knowledge in pursuit of a more profound understanding of the universe.

3. **Cultural implications**:

The arts and culture in this alternate world would likely integrate esoteric and occult themes in various creative forms. Art, literature, music, and other forms of expression might serve as vehicles for spiritual insights, teachings, and the communication of profound truths. Occult symbols and rituals could become part of daily life, while public spaces and architecture might be designed to incorporate mystical and spiritual perspectives. This would result in a society steeped in symbolism, allegory, and deep meaning in all aspects of culture.

4. **Political implications**:

In this alternate reality, political systems could be influenced by esoteric and occult principles such as the concept of enlightened rulership. Leadership would be seen as a selfless role intended to guide society towards spiritual growth and harmony, rather than personal power and wealth. The concepts of democracy and equality could still exist but evolve to include a deeper understanding of the spiritual responsibilities of those in power.

In conclusion, an alternate historical event in which a prominent occult figure like John Dee helped establish a global utopian society based on esoteric and occult principles would have had significant implications on the development and perception of occultism and esotericism. This scenario would have intertwined social, cultural, and political contexts that would have led to a world where spiritual growth, compassion, and wisdom were emphasized over material gain and power, ultimately leading to a more harmonious, interconnected, and spiritually aware society. The arts and sciences would have been integrated with the mystical, in an effort to achieve a more profound understanding of the human experience and our place in the universe.
