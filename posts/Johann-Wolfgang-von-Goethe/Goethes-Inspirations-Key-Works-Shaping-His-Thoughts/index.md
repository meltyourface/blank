## Title: Annotated Bibliography of Seminal Works Influencing Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

1. Spinoza, B. (1677). Ethics. 

Baruch Spinoza's "Ethics" is a philosophical work that profoundly impacted Goethe's thoughts on the nature of reality and the individual's relationship to the universe. "Ethics" is a rational exposition of Spinoza's metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical thought, which presents the idea of God as an impersonal, infinite substance, comprising all of reality. This work provided Goethe with a framework for understanding the interconnectedness of the world. From this perspective, Goethe's own concept of "world literature" can be seen as an attempt to unify disparate cultural expressions into a coherent whole.

Literary/Philosophical Context: Spinoza was an influential Dutch philosopher of the 17th century who stood at the crossroads of rationalism and empiricism. His monistic system contrasted sharply with those of his contemporaries, such as Descartes.

2. Shakespeare, W. (1597). Romeo and Juliet.

William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet" left a profound impression on Goethe and played a key role in shaping the direction of his creative vision. Notably, Goethe's first major work, "The Sorrows of Young Werther," reflected the influence of Shakespeare's portrayal of unrequited love and the tragic consequences that may follow. This influence also extended to Goethe's preoccupation with duality and his development of complex, multidimensional characters.

Literary/Philosophical Context: Shakespeare was an English playwright and poet whose dramatic works defined the development of early modern English literature. His works approached themes such as love, tragedy, and power, exploring the human condition in a nuanced and profound manner.

3. Rousseau, J.J. (1762). The Social Contract. 

Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "The Social Contract" informed Goethe's thinking about the nature of society and the individual's role within it. This political treatise examines the social contract, a theoretical agreement that outlines the responsibilities and rights of the individual in relation to the collective. Rousseau's ideas fostered in Goethe a commitment to the development of community and an awareness of the importance of fostering both individual freedom and shared responsibility.

Literary/Philosophical Context: Rousseau was an Enlightenment-era Swiss philosopher whose theories on politics and human nature emphasized the importance of individual liberty balanced with the needs of the community.

4. Winckelmann, J. J. (1755). Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture. 

Johann Joachim Winckelmann's essay "Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture" played a significant role in shaping Goethe's thoughts on artistic expression and the pursuit of beauty. Winckelmann's admiration for the ancient Greeks' aesthetic ideals left a lasting impression on Goethe, who adopted similar notions in his own works. This influence is evident in Goethe's treatment of classical themes, such as the interplay between harmony and discord, and the fusion of sensuality and spirituality.

Literary/Philosophical Context: Winckelmann was an influential German art historian and archaeologist who laid the groundwork for the study of classical art and inspired the neoclassical movement in Europe.

5. Homer. (c. 8th century BCE). The Iliad and The Odyssey. 

Homer's epic poems "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" served as pillars of inspiration for Goethe, instilling in him a profound appreciation for the grandeur and scope of ancient Greek literature. The influence of these works can be seen in Goethe's lifelong fascination with heroism, conflict, and epic journeys, as evidenced by his magnum opus, "Faust."

Literary/Philosophical Context: Homer is an ancient Greek poet traditionally credited with authoring these foundational works of Western literature. They depict grand tales of heroism, strife, and perseverance, reflecting the values and beliefs of their time.
