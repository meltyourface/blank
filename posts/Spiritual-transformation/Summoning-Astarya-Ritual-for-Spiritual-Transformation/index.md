Invocation for Summoning the Deity of Spiritual Transformation: Astarya

**Introduction**:
Astarya, the deity of spiritual transformation, is known for her divine power to facilitate inner growth, healing, and metamorphosis. To successfully summon her, a ritual must be conducted with the utmost care, incorporating sacred symbols, offerings, chants, and meditations.

**Symbols**:
1. ****The Serpent****: A symbol of transformation, shedding old skin, and renewal.
2. ****The Phoenix****: Representing rebirth and rising above challenges.
3. ****The Lotus****: Demonstrating spiritual development amidst adversity.
4. ****The Ouroboros****: The eternal cycle of transformation and self-re-creation.

Sacred Offerings:
1. ****Incense****: Palo Santo or Sandalwood, to purify and cleanse the space.
2. ****Crystals****: Labradorite, to aid in transformation and protect from negative energies.
3. ****Food****: Fresh fruit, symbolic of nature's cycle of growth and abundance.
4. ****Candle****: A purple or indigo candle to represent spiritual awakening.

**Chants**:
Invoke the presence of Astarya by reciting the following chant in a slow, reverential tone:

"Athari Domine Astarya, veni ad me,
Serpentis ignis, invictus renascentia,
In ferarum rota, omni evolutio,
Astarya, adiuvat mihi transformatio."

(Translation: "Ruling Astarya, come to me,
Serpent's fire, undefeated rebirth,
In the wheel of life, every evolution,
Astarya, assist my transformation.")

**Meditations**:
Focus on the breath while visualizing protective, healing energy surrounding and permeating you. Reflect upon your intention for seeking spiritual transformation and remain open to receiving divine guidance from Astarya.

Astrological Alignments and Planetary Energy:
The most auspicious time to perform this ritual is during a New Moon or Full Moon, specifically when the Sun and Moon align with transformative Pluto. This heightens astrological energies and provides a portal for powerful transformation.

**Location**:
Choose a sacred and secluded space, in the presence of natural bodies of water or ancient trees. This enhances the connection to the earth, growth, and rebirth.

Expected Outcomes:
Upon successfully invoking Astarya, the celebrant's spiritual journey and metamorphosis will be accelerated, guided, and supported. **This may manifest in the form of**:
1. Enhanced intuition and increased spiritual awareness.
2. Closure and healing of past wounds.
3. Mental clarity and a renewed sense of purpose.
4. Strength to overcome obstacles and embrace change.

Astarya's divine presence will shape the celebrant's journey towards unity between the physical, emotional, and spiritual realms, ultimately leading to a state of oneness and harmony with the universe.
