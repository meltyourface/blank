Introduction:
Joachim of Fiore's Three Ages and William Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations are significant milestones in the study and development of European eschatology. In this response, we will explore the intricacies of these two perspectives, analyze their correlations and divergences, and consider their historical settings. Furthermore, we will discuss the impact of these interpretations on the development of eschatological theories and movements across Europe.

Joachim of Fiore's Three Ages:
Joachim of Fiore was a medieval theologian who lived between 1135 and 1202 AD. He proposed a tripartite model for understanding human history, which he referred to as the "Three Ages." Joachim's theory divides time into three epochs:

1. The Age of the Father, which corresponds to the Old Testament era. This age is associated with the reign of God the Father and the obedience to the Law.
2. The Age of the Son, which corresponds to the New Testament era. This age is connected to the reign of Jesus Christ and the practice of faith according to the Christian teachings.
3. The Age of the Holy Spirit, a period of spiritual renewal and contemplation. This age is characterized by a direct relationship between humans and the Holy Spirit, eventually leading to universal harmony and peace.

Joachim believed that the Age of the Holy Spirit would be ushered in through a transformation of the Catholic Church, and expressed his theories in several works, notably his "Liber Concordis Novi et Veteris Testamenti."

William Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations:
William Miller was an American theologian born in 1782 and died in 1849. He developed a complex system of calculating the prophetic timeline for the return of Jesus Christ and the end of the world. Miller's calculations were based on his interpretation of the biblical prophecies from the Book of Daniel, particularly the "2,300 evening and mornings" prophecy in Daniel 8:14.

Miller interpreted the 2,300 "evenings and mornings" as representing 2,300 years, and believed that the prophecy began in 457 BCE with the decree of Emperor Artaxerxes of Persia to rebuild Jerusalem. According to his calculations, the Second Coming of Christ and the end of the world would occur around 1843-1844.

Correlations and Divergences:
While both theories originate from a Christian eschatological perspective, there are key differences between them. Joachim of Fiore's Three Ages provides a broader outlook on human history, encompassing different phases of divine reign. His approach emphasizes the importance of social and spiritual transformation within the Church.

On the other hand, William Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations focus primarily on predicting the exact date for the return of Christ and the end of the world. This approach is based on a literal interpretation of biblical prophecies. Though both theories assert a spiritual renewal within their respective frameworks, the nature of this renewal varies between the two.

Historical Settings and Influence:
Joachim of Fiore's ideas had a significant impact on the development of eschatological theories in medieval Europe. His theories were embraced by various religious movements, contributing to the rise of apocalyptic expectations and messianic fervor. Moreover, his concept of the "Three Ages" has influenced later eschatological theories, including process theology and the concept of "progressive revelation" in Protestantism.

In contrast, William Millerâ€™s predictions spurred the Millerite movement, which attracted a substantial following throughout Europe and the United States. Though the predicted end of the world in 1843-1844 did not occur, this movement led to the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and contributed to the general eschatological discourse in Europe and America.

**Summary**:
In conclusion, Joachim of Fiore's Three Ages and William Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations reflect significant milestones in the history of European eschatology. Joachim's theory is focused on the broader historical and social process, whereas Miller's calculations center on predicting an exact date for the end of the world. Both theories influenced the development of eschatological thought, shaping religious beliefs and practices in medieval Europe and America.
