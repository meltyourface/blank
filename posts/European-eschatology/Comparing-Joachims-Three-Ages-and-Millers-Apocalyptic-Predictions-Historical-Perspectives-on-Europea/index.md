Answer to the Knowledge Challenge:

Joachim of Fiore's Three Ages and William Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations are two highly influential perspectives on European eschatology that provide a rich contextual basis to explore their respective intricacies, correlations, and divergences, along with their impact on subsequent theories and movements.

Joachim of Fiore, an influential 12th century Italian mystic and theologian, developed the concept of the Three Ages, which he derived from his exegesis of biblical scripture. These three ages - the Age of the Father, the Age of the Son, and the Age of the Holy Spirit - are characterized by distinct historical periods marked by different modes of divine manifestation and religious expression.

1. The Age of the Father, which corresponds to the Old Testament, is characterized by the Law and marks the governance of the Father. 
2. The Age of the Son, which spans the New Testament era, is characterized by the Gospel and marks the reign of Christ. 
3. The Age of the Holy Spirit, which was yet to come according to Joachim, would usher in an age of spiritual enlightenment and universal apostolic freedom, transcending the institutional church and preceding the Second Coming of Christ.

Despite the predominantly spiritual and non-apocalyptic nature of Joachim's Three Ages, later Joachite thinkers linked the beginning of the Age of the Holy Spirit to specific years, such as 1260. The Franciscans and other religious orders subsequently adopted elements of his ideas to support their visions of reform.

William Miller, a 19th century American "Adventist" preacher, is known for his apocalyptic calculations that aimed to predict the precise date of the Second Coming of Christ. He arrived at his calculations by interpreting Biblical prophecies, particularly the 2300-day prophecy found in the Book of Daniel. Miller believed that the 2300 days represented 2300 years, which began with the decree to restore Jerusalem in 457 B.C., and by employing his calculations, he deduced that Jesus would return in 1843 or 1844. Despite the inaccurate predictions, Miller's ideas would form the basis of the Adventist movement, which spread across Europe and ingrained itself in a variety of religious and spiritual movements.

When comparing Joachim's Three Ages and Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations, several key correlations and divergences emerge:

1. Both Joachim and Miller are rooted in the tradition of biblical interpretation, with Joachim's exegesis of the scriptures informing his Three Ages, and Miller's application of prophetic calculations to ascertain the date of Christ's return.

2. Both theories are centered on distinct historical periods or events that mark significant changes in the nature of religious experience, with the transition between Joachim's Ages representing shifts in divine governance and the imminent return of Christ in Miller's calculations heralding the end of the current world order.

However, significant divergences also arise:

1. Joachim's Three Ages are characterized by a primarily spiritual and non-apocalyptic focus, emphasizing the transformation of religious experience and expression rather than specific apocalyptic events. In contrast, Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations are developed explicitly to predict the date of Christ's return and the associated events preceding the end of the world.

2. Joachim's approach, while offering a universal vision of history, does not aim to define precise dates and remains ambiguous about the duration of each age. Miller's approach is oriented specifically towards determining the exact date of the Second Coming of Christ based on his interpretation of biblical prophecies.

These two perspectives have contributed significantly to the development of eschatological theories and movements across Europe. Joachim's Three Ages influenced medieval apocalyptic movements and later reform-oriented religious groups such as the Franciscans and the Spirituals. Meanwhile, Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations fueled the Adventist movement and left an enduring impact on various religious and spiritual organizations that adopted or adapted his ideas.

In summary, Joachim of Fiore's Three Ages and William Miller's Apocalyptic Calculations demonstrate correlations in their biblical interpretation and the centrality of historical periods or events in their frameworks, but diverge in their focus on apocalypticism and the specificity of their predictions. Both perspectives have had far-reaching influences on the development of eschatological theories and movements across Europe, shaping the course of religious thought and practice for centuries.
