## The Ritual of Astral Communion

**Objective**: To beckon and communicate with benevolent spirits from the astral realm.

### I. Preparations
 A. Location
    1. Choose an area that feels filled with positive energy. This may be a spot in nature such as a forest clearing or a peaceful garden or a private room in your residence that has been imbued with love and warmth.
    2. Ensure the location is free from distractions and interruptions.
 B. Sacred Items and Materials
    1. An altar cloth, preferably the color purple to signify higher spirituality.
    2. A chalice or bowl filled with purified or spring water.
    3. A ceremonial dagger or wand.
    4. Ritual candles in white, representing purity, and blue, symbolizing astral energies. (Four of each)
    5. Incense made with frankincense, myrrh, and lavender.
    6. Salt to create a protective circle.
    7. A large quartz or amethyst crystal.
    8. A piece of parchment and pen for recording any messages received from the spirits.
 C. Optimal Lunar Phase
    1. Perform the ritual during a waxing moon or full moon to harness the power of growth and heightened spiritual energies.
 D. Space Consecration
    1. Cleanse the area with a combination of water, salt, and burning sage.
    2. Invoke the assistance of a higher power or deity you align with, asking for protection and guidance during the ritual.

### II. The Ritual
 A. Casting the Circle
    1. Use the ceremonial dagger or wand to trace a circle around your ritual space.
    2. Place the blue candles at the cardinal points (north, south, east, and west) and the white candles in the corners to represent the four elements (air, fire, water, and earth).
    3. Light the incense and walk around the circle clockwise, allowing the smoke to permeate the space.
    4. Sprinkle a line of salt around the circumference of the circle for protection.
 B. Invocations and Incantations
    1. Place the amethyst or quartz crystal at the center of your altar.
    2. Hold your hands above the crystal and recite the following incantation:

       "Spirits of the astral realm, guides of light and wisdom,
       I call upon thee to join me in this sacred space,
       Reveal to me your presence, impart your benevolent insight,
       So that I may learn and grow under your luminous guidance."

    3. Meditate to raise your personal energy and attune to astral vibrations.
 C. Summoning and Communion
    1. Call upon specific benevolent spirits or remain open to any helpful entities from the astral realm.
    2. When a connection is established, engage in respectful conversation, seeking wisdom, advice, or clarification on life situations.
    3. Record any messages received onto the parchment.
 D. Closing the Ritual
    1. Express gratitude to the spirits for their presence and any guidance received.
    2. Bid them farewell with the following invocation:

       "Benevolent spirits of the astral realm, luminous guides,
       With deep gratitude, I thank you for your presence and wisdom,
       As you return to your celestial abode, leave only love and light behind,
       In the name of [your chosen higher power or deity], I bid thee farewell."

    3. Extinguish the candles, starting with the white candles, followed by the blue candles, working counterclockwise.
    4. Remove the salt circle, collect the sacred items, and restore the space to its original condition.

### III. Protective Measures
 A. Create an amulet or talisman by charging a small quartz crystal with your intent for protection during the ritual. Wear the amulet or keep it near you throughout the process. B. Envision yourself within a sphere of white light, imbued with the energy and protection of your chosen higher power or deity. C. Regularly engage in meditation and spiritual practices to strengthen your connection to benevolent energies, ensuring malevolent entities are kept at bay.

Remember to remain respectful and focused on your intent throughout the ritual in order to maintain a safe and sacred space for astral communion.
