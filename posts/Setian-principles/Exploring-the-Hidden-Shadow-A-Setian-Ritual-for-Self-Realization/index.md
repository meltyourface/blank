## The Ceremony of the Hidden Shadow

1. **Purpose and Intention**

The Ceremony of the Hidden Shadow aims to awaken and strengthen a deep connection with one's personal daemon (also known as the "Higher Self" or "Holy Guardian Angel") through the exploration of Setian principles and adherence to the Left Hand Path. This path emphasizes self-discovery, individualism, and the embrace of one's inner darkness, ultimately leading to a greater understanding of one's personal power.

2. Pre-Ritual Preparation

To effectively prepare for the ceremony, the practitioner must first create a personalized sacred space that encompasses the key elements of Setianism:

- Cleanse the chosen area with a banishing ritual, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, to remove any negative or unwanted energies.
- Construct a custom altar to serve as the focal point of your ritual. Place a Setian pentagram at the center, symbolizing the unity of the five elements and the balance of self.
- Surround the altar with related symbols and tools, including a sigil or amulet representing the personal daemon, a chalice, athame, incense burner, and candles in corresponding colors (typically red and black).
- Arrange nine black candles in a circle around the sacred space, representing the nine angles of the Tree of Wyrd, a key symbol in Setian lore.

3. **Invocation Methods**

Initiating the ceremony, the practitioner must stand within the sacred space and invoke their individual daemon through the articulation of personalized invocations and chants, such as:

- Recite the Setian Invocation of the Self: "I am the eternal flame, the spark of divinity within. I invoke the spirit of Set, the hidden shadow, to awaken my true potential and connect with my personal daemon."

- Chant the Invocation of the Dragon: "From the depths of my primal consciousness, I summon the power of the Dragon. May the Draconian current guide my inner darkness and reveal the essence of my personal daemon."

4. **Immersive Ritualistic Practices**

Following the invocations, the practitioner must engage in ritualistic practices tailored toward attuning their consciousness with Set and invoking their hidden daemon:

- Candle gazing: Encompassed by darkness, the practitioner should fixate their gaze upon the flickering flame of a solitary candle, allowing the flame to serve as a conduit for their consciousness, facilitating the connection between the practitioner and their daemon.

- Draconian pathworking: Encourage visualization of the connections between the nine angles of the Tree of Wyrd, establishing a symbolic representation of your journey toward self-realization and daemon communion.

- Guided meditations: Practice deep, focused breaths while visualizing the entity of Set coalescing with your individual daemon, emphasizing the unity of self-realization and divine power.

5. Post-Ritual Grounding

To maintain and sustain the invoked connection with the individual daemon, practitioners should engage in further grounding techniques:

- Journaling: Document the experiences, insights, and emotions that arose during the ceremony to reflect upon and better understand the developing bond between the practitioner and the daemon.

- Regular practice: Integrate elements of this ritual into daily meditation, invocation, and pathworking practices to reinforce the connection and enable continuous guidance, empowerment, and growth.

By adhering to these guidelines, practitioners will traverse the Ceremony of the Hidden Shadow in a manner that simultaneously respects the core principles of Setianism and fosters a deeply empowering, innovative ritual experience, ultimately unlocking the profound and transformative potential of the Left Hand Path.
