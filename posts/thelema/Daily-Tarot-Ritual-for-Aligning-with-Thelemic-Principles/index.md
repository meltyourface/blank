Here's an outline of this daily ritual:

1. **Invocation and Declaration of Thelemic Principles**:
Begin by invoking Thelema's guiding precept: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This is done to assert one's intention to act in accordance with their True Will.

2. **Preparation of the Sacred Space**:
Create a sacred, clean environment by lighting some candles and placing a white cloth on the table. On the cloth, place your tarot deck, a crystal for channeling energy (such as quartz or amethyst), a symbol representing Thelema (e.g., the Unicursal Hexagram), and an image of the Tree of Life.

3. **Selection of the Tarot Deck**:
Select a deck that resonates with Thelemic philosophy, such as the Thoth Tarot Deck or another deck that highlights the sephiroth and Major Arcana.

4. **Astrological Considerations**:
Before the reading, consult an astrological resources to determine any significant alignments or transits that may be occurring. Take note of these and consider how they might influence the energy of your reading.

5. **Casting the Unicursal Hexagram**:
On the white cloth, use a piece of chalk or another tool to draw a Unicursal Hexagram within a circle. Place one card from the Major Arcana corresponding to the sephiroth on each point of the hexagram. After the hexagram is formed, activate its energy by saying the words, "Unity, Love, Will."

6. **Tarot Reading Methodology**:
Begin the tarot reading by first focusing on your True Will and the Law of Thelema. Select a spread that will provide insight into the energies and archetypes present in accessing your True Willâ€”this can be a simple three-card spread for past, present, and future or a more complex spread such as the Celtic Cross.

7. **Interpretation and Integration of the Reading into One's True Will**:
Carefully analyze the reading and consider how it relates to your True Will. Pay particular attention to the Major Arcana, their positions within the Tree of Life, and the inherent correspondences between the cards and sephiroth. Contemplate how the messages of the cards can guide you in alignment with the Law of Thelema, and make note of any specific actions or new perspectives the reading suggests.

8. **Closing Intention and Gratitude**:
To end the ritual, silently express gratitude for the guidance provided by the Tarot. Reaffirm your commitment to living in accordance with the Law of Thelema and your True Will. Close the ritual by stating, "Love is the law, love under will."

By following these steps, you can incorporate the principles of Thelema into a daily tarot divination ritual, allowing you to delve deeper into your True Will and further align your actions with the Law of Thelema.
