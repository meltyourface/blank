Medieval manuscript grimoires, such as the Lesser Key of Solomon and the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic, provide a wealth of information on the intricate details of summoning rituals, conjurations, and methodologies employed in the evocation of spirits, demons, and angels. The grimoires utilized a variety of techniques, such as sigils, sacred geometry, tools, and invocations, with cultural and contextual factors influencing these practices.

In the Lesser Key of Solomon (also known as Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis), the text is dedicated to the summoning of spirits and angels, highlighting detailed instructions for conjuring and controlling demons. The techniques employed within the text utilize sigils or seals, which are symbols representing the spirits or demons, as well as tools such as the magic circle and the triangle of the art. Sigils were thought to enable the magician to invoke the spirit and exert control over it. Additionally, the text employs invocations of divine protection, including Hebrew divine names and angelic forces.

The Munich Manual of Demonic Magic, a fifteenth-century Latin grimoire, focuses primarily on necromancy and various forms of dark magic. Here, too, we find sacred geometry in the form of ritual circles, complex symbols, and sigils, as well as the use of invocations and prayers. However, the Munich Manual differs in its approach, often incorporating the use of bodily substances, physical elements, and contact with the dead. The overall methodology in the Munich Manual is considered darker, often emphasizing the magician's power to compel and coerce spirits and demons into fulfilling their desires.

Some differences in the approaches used within these grimoires can be attributed to the cultural and contextual factors that influenced their development. Factors such as regional folklore, religious traditions, scholarly exchange, and prevailing ideologies contributed to the various techniques and methodologies employed in these texts. For instance, the Lesser Key of Solomon reflects a Judeo-Christian framework, while the Munich Manual leans more towards the darker aspects of magic and necromancy.

Despite these distinctions, it is essential to consider the broader European cultural perspective of the late Middle Ages, wherein an increased fascination with the supernatural, astrology, and mysticism flourished. As a result, elements of both sacred and profane lore intermingle within these grimoires, highlighting a unique mingling of regional folk traditions and intellectual thought.

As for the evolution of these methods over time and their potential influences on contemporary esoteric and occult practices, it becomes clear that these medieval manuscript grimoires continue to have a lasting impact. Many modern practitioners draw inspiration from these texts, adapting and reconstructing these methodologies in contemporary contexts. The use of sigils, sacred geometry, invocations, and magical tools remain prominent in various esoteric practices today, from ceremonial magick to chaos magick, Wicca, modern witchcraft, and beyond.

In conclusion, the nuanced techniques and methodologies employed in medieval manuscript grimoires, such as the Lesser Key of Solomon and the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic, reveal a fascinating range of approaches to summoning and controlling spirits, demons, and angels. The cultural and contextual factors influencing these practices have helped shape the evolution of these methodologies over time, enabling their legacy to live on in contemporary esoteric and occult practices.
