In order to properly evaluate the influence and interconnectedness of the "Book of Abramelin the Mage," the "Arbatel of Magic," and the "Corpus Hermeticum" within the context of Western esoteric tradition, it is crucial to understand their basic tenets, historical relevance, and how their teachings have woven into the rich tapestry of occult practices. To provide a comprehensive answer, we shall examine these key aspects in detail, followed by a clear summary of their shared themes and crucial conclusions.

1. **Essential Teachings**:

a) "Book of Abramelin the Mage": Also known as "The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage", this manuscript, written in the 15th century, is a practical guide that teaches how to gain communication with one's guardian angel and use their knowledge to access magical powers. Focused on a six-to-eighteen-month-long program of ritual purification and asceticism, the book provides a step-by-step progression towards the acquisition of spiritual wisdom and enlightenment.

b) "Arbatel of Magic": Published in 1575, the "Arbatel of Magic" is a brief but influential collection of aphorisms and principles focusing on spiritual knowledge and theurgy. The text emphasizes the importance of living a pious and simple life dedicated to the pursuit of wisdom and truth. The teachings center on humility, reverence for the deity, adherence to natural laws, and the understanding of the natural world in all its facets.

c) "Corpus Hermeticum": A series of philosophical and mystical texts dating back to the 1st-3rd centuries AD, consisting of seventeen treatises attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (Thrice Great Hermes), the Greco-Egyptian sage. These texts synthesize ancient Greek and Egyptian knowledge with religious and mystical elements to present a comprehensive cosmology, the nature of reality, and spiritual development. The teachings incorporate the concept of Gnosis, or direct experience of divine wisdom, as an essential path toward enlightenment.

2. **Historical Significance**:

All three texts emerged at different times and places, reflecting the historical milieu and syncretic currents of the time. The "Book of Abramelin the Mage" roots in 15th-century Jewish mysticism, while the "Arbatel of Magic" is a product of the 16th-century European Renaissance. The "Corpus Hermeticum" hails from the Roman Empire of the early Common Era. 

Their impact on the field of occult knowledge is immense and multifaceted. For instance, the "Book of Abramelin the Mage" has influenced the modern Western esoteric tradition, such as the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a late 19th-century secret society. The "Arbatel of Magic" has contributed to a wide range of occult authors, including Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus. Meanwhile, the "Corpus Hermeticum" served as the foundation for Hermeticism, which has influenced various fields such as alchemy, Kabbalah, astrology, Christian mysticism, and the Renaissance revival of Neoplatonism.

3. **Development of Their Ideas in the Occult Disciplines**:

The interweaving of these three influential works has led to a series of synergetic ideas and practices in later occult traditions. The integration of higher metaphysics, angelic communication, and practical magic forms the core of later Western esoteric disciplines. The requirement of moral purification before engaging in magical practices, an idea emphasized in both the "Book of Abramelin the Mage" and the "Arbatel of Magic", also became a staple in the Western magical tradition. Additionally, the notion of Gnosis from the "Corpus Hermeticum" finds a place in the broader Western mystical tradition, including Christian mysticism and Gnosticism. 

In summary, the "Book of Abramelin the Mage," the "Arbatel of Magic," and the "Corpus Hermeticum" are each focal points in the Western esoteric tradition, highlighting essential teachings on spiritual enlightenment, historical significance, and integration of their ideas in the extended fabric of occult disciplines. Their shared themes of the pursuit of divine wisdom, moral purification, and practical application of magic offer profound insights into the human condition and provide a rich, interconnected framework for the continued development and appreciation of the occult sciences.
