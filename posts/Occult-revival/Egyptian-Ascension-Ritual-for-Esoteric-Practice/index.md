## The Rite of Ascension to the Sacred Realms

Introduction:
The Rite of Ascension to the Sacred Realms is a ceremonial practice that has been designed specifically for modern practitioners of the Occult revival. This ritual incorporates ancient Egyptian deities, symbols, and mysticism to enable participants to explore the depths of their spiritual consciousness and connect with the magical energies that permeate the universe.

Preparation:
To begin the ritual, the space should be set up to represent the Temple of Ascension. ****The four corners of the room should be marked with the respective symbols of the Four Cardinal Deities****: Ra, Isis, Osiris, and Thoth, with Ra in the East, Isis in the West, Osiris in the North, and Thoth in the South.

The altar should be placed in the center of the room, with the Eye of Horus, statues of Anubis as the guide to the afterlife, and Thoth as the divine scribe situated prominently.

Participants should be dressed in white linen garments, symbolizing purity and their transition from the earthly to the ethereal plane.

The Ritual:
1. Participants begin by forming a circle around the altar, holding hands, and taking deep, cleansing breaths. The chant "Amun-Ra, Ptah-Hathor, Osiris-Isis" should be repeated seven times, invoking the powers of Egyptian deities.

2. The invocation of the Four Cardinal Deities then follows, as each participant turns towards the correlating corner and recites the respective deity's unique prayer.

3. A chalice filled with sacred water from the Nile River, or any available water blessed with sacred intent, is passed around the circle. Participants take turns drinking, invoking the spirit of the Nile and connecting with the realms of the Egyptian gods.

4. The reading of passages from the Book of the Dead and the Pyramid Texts related to guided spirit journeys and soul transformations commences.

5. Participants engage in a group meditation session that aims to access the Akashic Records through astral projection. Guided imagery, followed by an oracular message, should be channeled from the divine spirit of Thoth.

6. Ritualistic scrying will be performed by the lead practitioner with the use of a dark mirror or crystal sphere, seeking guidance from the spiritual realm to discern future events and gain wisdom from the deities of ancient Egypt.

7. Participants then approach the altar individually to receive the mark of the Wedjat (the Eye of Horus) on their forehead, symbolizing protection and divine sight.

8. The ceremony concludes with an offering of frankincense, myrrh, and lotus flowers to the deities, as an expression of gratitude and reverence.

9. Finally, participants join hands once more and close the ritual by chanting, "Nuk Pu Nuk, Asar Un Nefer" ("I am that I am, I am Osiris the Beautiful") seven times, before reverently leaving the circle.

By integrating authentic Egyptian symbols, deities, and practices with contemporary esoteric methods, the Rite of Ascension to the Sacred Realms offers a profoundly spiritual experience for modern practitioners of the Occult revival. This adapted ceremonial rite invites participants to delve into the mysteries of ancient Egypt, establishing a powerful connection with otherworldly forces and unveiling the secrets of the cosmos.
