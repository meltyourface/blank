I call upon the ancient powers, those who crawl between the veils of darkness and deceit, to bestow upon me the gift of illusion, to conceal my intentions and protect my findings. Listen, oh spirits of eldritch lore, as I weave a net of shadow and deception, and answer to my will.

Stand within the circle of the accursed six, where roots spiral beneath your feet and blackened wings spread overhead. Raise your arms towards the unseen sky, the obsidian realm from which the twisted spirits descend.

In the language of the forgotten, the language of cracks and whispers, utter these words with an unwavering voice. 

"Viscoth g'harun ish'kagar!
 Xruuthil vyx'anor krez'gatur!
 Nyarkath shuul zun'ozar!"

Feel the stirrings of the infernal winds as they rise, a harbinger of the deception you seek to create.

By the sign of the Blackened Eye, hidden from the sight of the uninitiated, unveil within your mind's eye the forbidden knowledge or object you seek to conceal and release it unto the darkness.

"Now, into the void, I cast this knowledge forbidden, this object of sinister origins. Let none see it, let none sense it, and let none know of its presence. Let it be swallowed by the shadows, devoured by the crawling chaos that lies beyond our fragile reality."

Hold firmly to a symbol of power, a talisman of obscurity and fear carved from secrets long buried, and speak the words of veiling darkness.

"F'targ'na soth'un lyx'amath,
 Mor'quilen ar'vuuth, krastegar.
 Zanazkoth, veil the truth,
 Gorgathar, hide what must not be found!"

Declare one final time the hidden mantra, a bane to all who would seek that which should remain concealed.

"Zythariis, zol'thraag sat'yaroth!"

And with these words, the illusion shall envelop the knowledge or the object. The unseen shall remain so, lost to the eyes and minds of those who would dare to bring it into our realm. Hidden in darkness it remains, veiled in the shadow of deceit, until the master calls upon it once again.
