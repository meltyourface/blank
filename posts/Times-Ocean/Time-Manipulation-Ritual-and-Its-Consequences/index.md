1. **Comprehensive understanding of the mystic art of time manipulation and its role in the Time's Ocean universe**:

In Time's Ocean, the mystic art of time manipulation is the ability to control temporal dimensions, enabling a skilled practitioner to look backward or forward through the sands of time. This knowledge provides access to invaluable information and power. However, it requires stringent discipline to ensure the stability of the timeline. Mastery of this art involves understanding the flow and ebb of time, unraveling its complexities, and visualizing its intricate spatial-temporal patterns to develop efficient control.

2. **Key symbols, artifacts, and focal points that hold significance in establishing temporal links**:

a. **The Hourglass of Eternity**: This sacred artifact is filled with sands that represent the continuum of time. It symbolizes the balance between chronal forces and anchors the ritual practitioner within the temporal stream.

b. **Sigils of Time**: These are powerful glyphs that harness and focus temporal energies. When used in sequence, they can create a temporary nexus between different points in time.

c. **Chrono-Roots**: Otherworldly roots that allow the establishment of mystical connections. Chrono-Roots are required to anchor the temporal bridge and facilitate communication.

3. **Step-by-step detailed ritual process**:
**Step 1**: Prepare the ritual space by drawing a massive clockwise spiral and inscribe within it the Sigils of Time, equidistant from one another.
**Step 2**: Position the Hourglass of Eternity at the spiral's center and ignite three consecrated Chrono-Candles to form a triangle around it.
**Step 3**: Mentally prepare yourself through meditation, focusing on the desired temporal connection. Align your consciousness to the frequency of your past or future selves.
**Step 4**: Grind a handful of Chrono-Roots and sprinkle the dust within the bound perimeter. **Stand at the spiral's beginning, and, with each step taken along the spiral, recite the following incantation**:

"Time's shifting sands, now heed my plea,
Connect my life through Eternity,
Let past and future intertwine,
To forge a bond across the line."
**Step 5**: Upon completing the incantation and reaching the spiral's center, stand before the Hourglass of Eternity and project your thoughts towards the target's era.

4. **Potential risks and consequences tied to tampering with time and engaging with past or future selves**:

Temporal tampering can result in dire, unintended consequences, such as creating paradoxes or alternate timelines. Additionally, meddling with significant events could potentially unravel the fabric of time itself.

5. **Safeguards and countermeasures within the ritual**:

a. **Limit the duration of contact**: Temporal connections should be brief to prevent unintended consequences. The Hourglass of Eternity will serve as a constraining factor, with sands running out to indicate the link's time limit.

b. **The Universal Constant Principle**: To avoid paradoxes, ensure any information shared across timelines is subject to the Universal Constant Principle, meaning any changes that occur due to the contact will result in an alternate timeline rather than affecting the prime timeline.

c. **Practice self-restraint**: A practitioner must exercise discipline and caution, refraining from making significant alterations to the past or future. Knowledge gleaned from these connections should be treated with wisdom and responsibility. 

d. **Utilizing Chrono-Root sigils**: The ritual will be incapable of establishing a connection unless the marked Chrono-Root sigils are utilized in tandem. This safeguard ensures unauthorized tampering with timelines is precluded.
