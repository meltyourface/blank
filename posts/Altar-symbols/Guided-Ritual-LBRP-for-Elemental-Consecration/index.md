excerpt: Expertly guide a group of mystic practitioners in the intricate performance of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, with specific emphasis on utilizing Altar symbols and intricate hand motions. Ensure each participant effectively visualizes and manifests the four Archangels and their corresponding Alchemical symbols as they consecrate sacred space for spiritual workings.

Firstly, gather the group of mystic practitioners in a designated ritual space. Ensure that the area is clean, quiet, and conducive to focused spiritual work. Make certain that everyone is dressed appropriately in comfortable clothing and is in a focused state of mind.

1. Opening Prayer: Begin with a group prayer or invocation to set the intention for the spiritual work and to invite the presence of higher powers. Speak clearly and with conviction so that everyone is in harmony with the goal.

2. Altar Setup: Place a simple altar at the center of the ritual space, with a white candle, incense, and a chalice of water to represent the elements. On the altar, draw the Altar symbols that represent the four elements and the divine source:
   - Fire: A triangle pointing upwards
   - Water: A triangle pointing downwards
   - Air: An upward-facing triangle bisected by a horizontal line
   - Earth: A downward-facing triangle bisected by a horizontal line
   - Divine Source: A downward triangle with an upward triangle within it, forming a six-pointed star or hexagram.

3. Elemental Consecration: Light the white candle and incense, and have each practitioner gently dip their fingers into the chalice of water, signifying the purification and consecration of the elements.

4. Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP):
   a. The Qabalistic Cross: Stand facing East, eyes closed, envision a beam of white light descending from above. Touch your forehead, intoning "Ateh", then your chest, intoning "Malkuth". Touch the right shoulder, intoning "ve-Geburah", then the left, intoning "ve-Gedulah". Clasp your hands, intoning "le-Olahm, Amen".
   b. Drawing the Pentagrams: Begin in the East, draw a blue flaming pentagram using your dominant hand's index and middle fingers in the air. Conclude the pentagram with a piercing motion, intoning "YHVH". Visualize the flaming pentagram remaining in place, connecting you to the East.
   c. Repeat this process in the South, West, and North, with the corresponding God names as follows:
      i. South: ADONAI
      ii. West: EHEIEH
      iii. North: AGLA
   d. Connecting the Pentagrams: Starting from the East, trace a white circle around the edges of the pentagrams, envisioning all four being connected, forming a boundary of sacred space.
   e. Invocation of the Archangels: Expand your arms in the shape of a cross. Focus on visualizing each Archangel, reciting their Alchemical symbols and elemental correspondence:
      i. East: Raphael, Air - Yellow Robes, holding a Caduceus Wand
      ii. South: Michael, Fire - Red Robes, holding a Flaming Sword
      iii. West: Gabriel, Water - Blue Robes, holding a Chalice
      iv. North: Uriel, Earth - Green Robes, holding a Pentacle
      Recite: "Before me, Raphael. Behind me, Gabriel. On my right hand, Michael. On my left hand, Uriel. For about me flames the Pentagrams, and within me shines the Six-rayed Star."

5. Repeat the Qabalistic Cross to seal the energies and intentions within the sacred space.

6. Closing Prayer: With hands clasped, recite a closing prayer or affirmation to thank the higher powers for their guidance and assistance. Bid farewell to the elements, the Altar symbols, and the Archangels.

Instruct your fellow practitioners to take a moment and ground themselves before leaving the ritual space. Remind them that it is essential to practice the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram regularly to maintain strong connections to these spiritual energies and archetypal symbols.
