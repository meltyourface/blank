Battle Plan: Operation Phantasmal Reconnaissance

**Objective**:
Enable the strategic utilization of invisible magical beasts, such as phantasmal stalkers and spectral scouts, to gather crucial intelligence on enemy movements, strengths, and weaknesses during an intense confrontation between rival magical forces.

Phase 1: Preliminary Reconnaissance
1. Deploy spectral scouts into the enemy territory under cover of darkness. 
2. Utilize their invisible and intangible attributes to efficiently infiltrate enemy lines, avoiding detection by conventional means.
3. Task them with identifying key enemy assets: command centers, supply lines, troop deployments, and magical artillery placements.
4. Instruct them to pay special attention to any potential magical countermeasures employed by the opposing faction.

Phase 2: Monitoring and Tracking Enemy Movements
1. Assign phantasmal stalkers to shadow critical enemy targets, such as commanders, high-profile magical practitioners, and elite units.
2. Utilize their innate ability to remain unnoticed while moving at high-speed to stay on par with the targeted enemies.
3. Order them to continuously report on any changes in enemy formations, movements, and tactics.
4. Direct them to assess and identify any unexpected maneuvers or utilization of previously unknown magical abilities.

Phase 3: Communication Methods
1. Employ specially crafted enchanted amulets, bestowed upon both the phantasmal stalkers and the spectral scouts.
2. Utilize the amulets to facilitate a secure and untraceable telepathic link between the magical beasts and their battlefield controllers.
3. Ensure that the communication channel remains encrypted by incorporating a rotating cipher, known only to those who command the magical beasts.
4. Develop hand signals or other non-verbal methods for the magical beasts in case the telepathic link is compromised or during time-sensitive situations.

Phase 4: Counteracting Enemy Countermeasures
1. Prepare the magical beasts to anticipate and respond to any magical jamming or anti-invisibility spells utilized by the enemy faction.
2. Train the beasts to recognize magical-based traps, alarms, and barriers actively or passively detecting their presence.
3. Equip the spectral scouts and phantasmal stalkers with contingency items, such as temporary shielding amulets or mystic smoke grenades, allowing them to escape or counteract the enemy's countermeasure.
4. Establish predetermined extraction points for the magical beasts in case they are discovered or compromised to ensure their safety and maintain the integrity of the operation.

Phase 5: Final Analysis
1. Compile the gathered intelligence from the spectral scouts and phantasmal stalkers.
2. Evaluate and weigh the information against existing knowledge.
3. Formulate a comprehensive battle strategy using this newly acquired intelligence that emphasizes exploiting enemy weaknesses and neutralizing their strengths.
4. Disseminate and implement the adjusted battle plan quickly and efficiently across allied troops for a coordinated strike against the opposing magical forces.

By utilizing cunning methods of stealth and communication, this intricate battle plan ensures the vital information retrieved by invisible magical beasts contributes significantly to the success of the overall confrontation.
