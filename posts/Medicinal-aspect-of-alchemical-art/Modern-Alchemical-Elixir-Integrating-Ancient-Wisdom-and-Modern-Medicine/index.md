Supplementary ingredients:
1. Liposomal delivery system for enhanced bioavailability and absorption.
2. Synergistic herb, mineral or vitamin complexes to maximize efficacy.

Experimental journal:
Day 1: Researched the medicinal properties, side-effects, and potential interactions of each ingredient. Initiated consultation with experienced herbalists and medical practitioners on possible synergistic combinations.

Day 2: Evaluated the optimal ratio for each ingredient within the formula, accounting for individual body composition adaptations. 

Day 3: Developed a standardized extraction method for the active components of each ingredient, maintaining potency and stability, while also incorporating the liposomal delivery system into the preparation.

Day 4: Conferred with pharmaceutical experts to identify potential allergenic or adverse reactions to the formula, and formulated strategies for mitigation or accommodation.

Day 5: Compiled documentation on the experimental process, focused on maintaining full transparency and traceability.

Clinical trial and approval strategy:
Phase 1: Secure approval from relevant authorities by submitting a comprehensive dossier of preclinical data, risk-benefit analysis, and manufacturing process details.

Phase 2: Conduct initial clinical safety trials with a small sample size to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the elixir.

Phase 3: Extend the trial to larger groups examining efficacy, optimal dosage, and duration of administration.

Phase 4: Perform extensive, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to confirm the elixir's therapeutic value and assess long-term safety.

Phase 5: Upon successful completion of trials, organize submission for final approval, including clear labeling for appropriate usage, contraindications, and potential side effects.

Educational and marketing campaigns to create awareness and emphasize the benefits and proper usage of the Elixir Vitae.

Post-marketing surveillance to monitor real-world effectiveness and safety, allowing for necessary improvements and adaptations.
