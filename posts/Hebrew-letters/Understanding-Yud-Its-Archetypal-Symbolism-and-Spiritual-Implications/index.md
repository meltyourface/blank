To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the rich symbolism behind the Hebrew letter "Yud" (י), explore the significance of its numerical value (10), and uncover its connection to the Hebrew letters "Vav" (ו) and "Dalet" (ד). We will then delve into its connection to the "spark of creation" in Kabbalistic terms and discuss the potential for spiritual transformation through meditating on this letter and its intricate associations.

The Archetypal Symbolism of "Yud" (י)

In Hebrew, the letter "Yud" (י) is the smallest of all the letters, and yet, it carries profound archetypal symbolism. As the tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, it represents the completion of a cycle and the beginning of a new one. Furthermore, "Yud" is associated with the Divine essence in creation, as it is the first letter in the Tetragrammaton, or four-letter name of God (יהוה, YHVH).

Numerical Value of "Yud" (י): 10 

The numerical value of "Yud" is 10, which symbolizes the idea of unity arising from multiplicity. In Kabbalistic thought, ten is a crucial number, seen in the architecture of the Ten Sefirot - emanations or attributes through which the Ein Sof (Infinite) reveals itself. The Sefirot are arranged in three columns and form the basis of the Tree of Life, a central motif in Kabbalah. This alignment underlines the idea of balance, harmony, and interconnectedness, further reinforcing the significance of the number 10 as a representation of wholeness.

Union of "Vav" (ו) and "Dalet" (ד)

"Yud" (י) is visually and symbolically formed through the union of the Hebrew letters "Vav" (ו) and "Dalet" (ד). "Vav" is often associated with connection, while "Dalet" symbolizes a doorway or entrance to wisdom. The combination of these letters within the structure of "Yud" further emphasizes the innate connection between opposites and the necessity to bring disparate elements into harmony to achieve unity or oneness. In this sense, "Yud" (י) represents the potential for union with the Divine and the subsequent revelation of Divine wisdom.

Metaphysical Connection to the "Spark of Creation"

In Kabbalistic thought, the "Yud" (י) symbolizes the "spark of creation" – the Divine energy that infuses everything in existence. This metaphysical connection stems from its role as the initial letter in the name of God, but also in the creative act itself. In the formation of the Hebrew letters, "Yud" is considered the "seed" from which all other letters grow, further highlighting its connection to the act of creation. Thus, the "Yud" embodies the creative force of the universe that perpetually transforms and generates new life.

Meditative Insights and Spiritual Transformations

By meditating on the Hebrew letter "Yud" (י) and its associated symbolism, one can gain a deeper understanding of the profound interconnectedness of all things, the process of creation, and the Divine essence inherent in everything. **This meditative practice can lead to numerous insights and spiritual transformations, such as**:

1. Deepening one's awareness of the cycle of life and the importance of balance and unity in the universe.
2. Recognizing the inherent potential for growth, change, and renewal within oneself and the world.
3. Gaining insight into the Divine nature of existence and appreciating the spiritual energy that permeates all things.
4. Fostering a stronger connection to the Divine and accessing deeper levels of spiritual wisdom.

In summary, the Hebrew letter "Yud" (י) embodies a wealth of archetypal symbolism, from the number 10 representing unity through multiplicity, to the union of the letters "Vav" (ו) and "Dalet" (ד), signifying connection and entrance to wisdom, respectively. Its metaphysical connection to the "spark of creation" instills an understanding of the creative power within the Divine essence. Meditating on "Yud" and its intricate associations can lead to spiritual transformations, with insights that enhance one's understanding of unity, balance, and the presence of the Divine in all aspects of life.
