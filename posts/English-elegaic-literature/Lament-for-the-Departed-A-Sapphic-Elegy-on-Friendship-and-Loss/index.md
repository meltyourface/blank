excerpt: > 
  Compose a persona deeply rooted in the realm of English elegaic literature, and craft a poignant epistle in verse. Within this mournful missive, communicate the harrowing loss of a cherished bond, perhaps inspired by such relationships as those between Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam A.H.H. or Milton's Lycidas. Ensure a rich tapestry of allusions, emotions, and vivid imagery to bestow life upon each melancholic line, thereby evoking the hauntingly beautiful essence of classical English elegies.

In the verdant vale where silver streams abound,
A lonely wraith wreathed in shadows profound,
A visage wrought with tender grief and scorn,
Solace she sought for wounds yet unadorned.

A forlorn spirit of elegy named Artemisia,
Bridging past and present with Sapphic harmonia.
Her woebegone tale in dire longing to express,
Unfurls the tragedy lost to Time's abyss.

The epistle in verse, her heart in ink now bled,
Serenades the living in memory of the dead:
O lamenting Muse that weeps on mournful shore,
Sing the severed bond betwixt friends forevermore!

In this sagacious grove, where sighing branches sway,
I summon thee for solace, oh Ages! Stay,
Beneath the glowing face of the supercilious moon,
Summon the spirit of Lycidas, for his voice I long to croon.

Long hath the world mourned sweet Lycidas, dear brother,
Who by perfidious hand was torn twixt Fate and Nature.
Like to Tennyson's whispered A.H.H., noble and fair,
Now forever lost to me in celestial lair.

Parted we are by Stygian gloom, the veil of death,
Yet warmed I feel with every lachrymose breath.
By the gaping maw of chasmed Hades some have entered,
Ne'er to return, by somber darkness rendered.

Then oh Elysian Fields, pale phantoms weave,
Enshrouded in the sorrows that immortalize grief.
Let the flower of friendship bloom anew o'er his grave,
As the nightingale's lament weaves ballads for the brave.

Through the gloaming twilight, amidst sanguine tears,
Shall our bond resound in allusive timeliers.
Like the cypress and willow in Orion's vigil, entwined,
Our twin spirits shall flourish till the sun is resigned.

So shall I take up thy mantle, dear friend now flown,
With elegiac notes thy legacy shall be sown.
Thrice sung the Sisters' paean, and Heaven's high throne,
Their tears like crystal lamentations—in sorrow I shall roam.

Now adieu, fair Shade, until we meet in yonder skies,
Bound like the stars, on silken lashes of divine lullabies.
Artemisia, thy Muse, remains by Helicon’s bower,
To trace your name in twilight e'er the vernal shower.
