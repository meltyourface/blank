The Ouroboros, the cosmic serpent representing cyclical time and eternal return, is a powerful symbol within the context of the Mithras Liturgy. This ancient Gnostic text, found in the Greek Magical Papyri, explores the divine mysteries and the ascent of the soul. To fully understand this symbol and its relationship to the Mithras Liturgy, we must first delve into its historical context, its symbolic associations with knowledge and the duality of existence, and its role in transmitting esoteric wisdom to the Mysteries initiates.

The Ouroboros, an ancient emblem with roots in the cultures of Egypt and Greece, depicts a serpent or dragon devouring its own tail, symbolizing the cyclic nature of existence and the concept of eternal return. It appears in many Gnostic texts, including the Mithras Liturgy, and is prominently featured within Mithraic iconography, often surrounding the tauroctony scene.

The ancient Hellenistic and Egyptian origins of Mithras are strongly connected to Gnostic cosmology and the celestial realm. Mithraism draws inspiration from both cultures, blending their beliefs and customs to create a unique system that emphasizes the ascent of the soul and the attainment of divine knowledge. As a god of light, worshiped primarily by the Roman military during the later days of the Roman Empire, Mithras is often associated with the sun. He is depicted as being born from a rock, an allegory for the soul emerging from the material world.

Within the context of the Mithras Liturgy, the Ouroboros serves as a symbol of cyclical time and eternal return in the Gnostic ascent process. The serpent swallowing its tail is an embodiment of the duality of existence, as both the material realm and the spiritual realm. This dualism is central to Gnostic beliefs and the initiate's journey through the Mysteries.

The interconnectedness of Gnostic cosmology, the celestial realm, and the allegorical journey of the neophyte within the secret Mithraic rites is evident throughout the Mithras Liturgy. The seven planetary spheres, or heavens, represent different stages of the neophyte's ascent, with each sphere governed by a cosmic entity or deity. To pass through these spheres, the initiate must demonstrate an understanding of the esoteric knowledge connected to each realm. The Ouroboros, in its role as a symbol of eternal return and cyclical time, signifies the continual renewal of this process.

In conclusion, the Ouroboros, as a representation of cyclical time and eternal return, plays a significant role within the Mithras Liturgy. Its symbolism, rooted in the duality of existence and the pursuit of Gnostic knowledge, is interconnected with the celestial realm and the neophyte's journey within the Mithraic rites. By reflecting upon the ancient Hellenistic and Egyptian origins of Mithraism, we gain a deeper understanding of the Ouroboros and its intricate relationship to the Mithras Liturgy, a text that reveals the hidden wisdom and esoteric insight sought by those who endeavored to uncover the divine mysteries of the universe.
