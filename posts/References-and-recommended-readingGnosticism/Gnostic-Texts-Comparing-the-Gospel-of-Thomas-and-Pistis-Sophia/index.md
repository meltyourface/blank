To address the knowledge challenge, we will first provide an overview of the Gospel of Thomas and the Pistis Sophia, including their historical and cultural contexts. Then, we will analyze their esoteric and exoteric expressions of Gnosticism, comparing and contrasting their themes and ideas.

The Gospel of Thomas is a non-canonical Christian text that consists of a collection of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus, which are generally considered to be of Gnostic origin. Discovered in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945, the text is believed to have been written in the early 2nd century AD. Unlike the canonical Gospels, the Gospel of Thomas has no narrative structure and primarily presents a series of secret teachings and wisdom sayings that emphasize acquiring knowledge (gnosis) for spiritual transformation.

The Pistis Sophia, on the other hand, is a Gnostic treatise written around the mid-3rd century AD with possible Egyptian origins. This text is more extensive and complex, containing a narrative framework centered around Jesus and his post-resurrection teachings to his disciples. The primary focus of the Pistis Sophia is on the mechanism of redemption, the structure of the divine realms, and the role of the aeons in the cosmic drama of fall and restoration.

The historical and cultural contexts of these texts differ significantly. The Gospel of Thomas reflects a period when various early Christian communities coexisted and occasionally competed or interacted, which allowed considerable room for a diversity of views and beliefs. The Pistis Sophia, written later and closer to the formation of the orthodox Christian Church, bears witness to a more developed and systematized Gnostic thought, reflecting the wider spiritual and intellectual milieu of the 3rd-century Mediterranean world.

The esoteric and exoteric expressions of Gnosticism in the Gospel of Thomas can be primarily seen in the enigmatic wisdom sayings of Jesus. Esoterically, the text offers a path toward gnosis through unlocking and understanding the hidden meanings of Jesusâ€™s parables, suggesting that this process of gaining knowledge lies beyond the grasp of the uninitiated. The emphasis on self-discovery and individual enlightenment through a direct and internal experience of the divine diverges from traditional exoteric Christian teachings. As such, the Gospel of Thomas is less concerned with religious orthodoxy or prescriptions for behavior, and more focused on an individual's transformative quest for spiritual insight.

By contrast, the Pistis Sophia embodies a more systematic and elaborate esoteric framework, addressing complex cosmological and theological themes. The text describes a sophisticated hierarchy of divine beings (aeons) and realms (Pleroma), explores the intricate notion of divine sparks trapped in human souls, and narrates the journey of the eponymous fallen aeon (Pistis Sophia) toward redemption. The Pistis Sophia displays both esoteric aspects, through unveiling the hidden dimensions of reality and the mechanisms of human spiritual ascent, and exoteric elements, by outlining specific behaviors and moral standards required for redemption.

In conclusion, the Gospel of Thomas and the Pistis Sophia represent distinct approaches to expressing and embodying Gnostic ideas while reflecting the historical and cultural developments of their times. The Gospel of Thomas is characterized by its enigmatic wisdom sayings and the emphasis on personal spiritual transformation, whereas the Pistis Sophia delves into the complexities of Gnostic cosmology and theology. While both texts share a core focus on the individual's quest for knowledge and salvation through esoteric means, they differ in the scope and intricacies of their spiritual teachings and their relationship with the broader religious and intellectual contexts of their respective periods.
