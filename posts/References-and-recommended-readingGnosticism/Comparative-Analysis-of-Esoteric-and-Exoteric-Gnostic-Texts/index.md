In order to thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first establish a fundamental understanding of Gnosticism itself, as well as outline key principles of esoteric and exoteric expressions. Gnosticism is a religious and philosophical movement that emerged in the early Christian era, incorporating elements of pre-Christian religions and diverse traditions from Jewish, Greek, and Egyptian sources. Gnostic teachings emphasize the importance of inner, esoteric knowledge (gnosis) which grants salvation and self-realization, as opposed to the exoteric, or outer, teachings and rituals practiced by followers of organized religions.

Esoteric expressions in spiritual teachings are the hidden, allegorical and symbolic aspects of a doctrine, meant for an elite and enlightened group of adherents who have an intuitive understanding of the inner truths. In contrast, exoteric expressions are the more conventional and outer aspects of a doctrine, accessible to the general populace and embedded within the established rituals, prayers, and mainstream religious practices.

Now, we will delve into comparing and contrasting the Gospel of Thomas and the Pistis Sophia in terms of their esoteric and exoteric expressions of Gnosticism, while considering the differing historical and cultural contexts in which they emerged.

The Gospel of Thomas:

The Gospel of Thomas is a noncanonical Gospel that consists of 114 sayings, or logia, attributed to Jesus. Discovered in 1945 in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, this text dates back to the 2nd century CE and is associated with the Syrian-Thomas branch of the Gnostic tradition. Its purpose is to convey the esoteric teachings of Jesus, as it claims that proper understanding of these sayings can lead to salvation.

Esoteric expressions in the Gospel of Thomas are found in the cryptic, parabolic, and metaphorical nature of the sayings. Such sayings often appear abstract and demand contemplation, spiritual guidance, and inner reflection to decipher their true meaning. The central theme revolves around the discovery of the divine light within oneself.

Exoteric elements, on the other hand, are scarce in the Gospel of Thomas, as it does not contain narratives of Jesus’ life, nor establish any specific doctrines or religious practices. However, there are sayings with close resemblance to those found in canonical Gospels, making the Gospel of Thomas an accessible reference for those interested in exploring Gnosticism from a Christian perspective.

The Pistis Sophia:

Pistis Sophia is a Gnostic text discovered in the late 18th century, composed around the 3rd or 4th century CE in Egypt. It is a tour de force of Gnostic cosmology, theology, and soteriology, and is structured as a dialogic revelation narrated by Jesus after his resurrection. The text presents a complex mythological narrative involving Pistis Sophia – a female divine figure representing the "lost" or "fallen" soul – and her journey of redemption and restoration through the attainment of gnosis.

Esoteric expressions in the Pistis Sophia are found in its elaborate cosmogony, metaphysical principles, and the symbolism of the divine feminine principle embodied by Sophia. Additionally, the complex system of repentances, prayers, and the progression through eons, or heavenly realms, as explained in the text, requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles and initiation into Gnostic teachings.

As for exoteric expressions, they are evident in the conversion of mainstream Christian concepts and figures into Gnostic symbolism, such as the identification of Mary, the mother of Jesus, as Pistis Sophia, as well as the portrayal of Jesus as a Gnostic revealer of truth. Furthermore, the incorporation of repentance, prayers, and penance aligns with the practices of orthodox Christianity, making the Pistis Sophia relatable to a wider audience.

Historical and Cultural Context:

The Gospel of Thomas emerged in a time when multiple iterations of Christianity were competing for followers, and Gnostic movements mingled with Jewish, Greek, and early Christian philosophies. It reflects the diversity of early spiritual thought in a non-hierarchical and open interpretation of Jesus' teachings.

Pistis Sophia, conversely, was written in a context where orthodox Christian doctrines were already firmly established, and Gnostic traditions were considered heretical. The text, therefore, contains elements that serve as an attempt to reconcile Gnostic teachings with the emerging Christian orthodoxy, bridging the gap between the esoteric inner circle of Gnosticism and the exoteric, religious expressions of the day.

In conclusion, the Gospel of Thomas and the Pistis Sophia both present esoteric teachings within the Gnostic tradition but differ in their accessibility to wider audiences. The Gospel of Thomas contains primarily esoteric expressions through cryptic sayings meant for contemplation, while the Pistis Sophia encompasses more exoteric components, embedding them within an elaborate cosmology that incorporates familiar Christian elements. The historical and cultural contexts in which these texts emerged significantly influenced their content and presentation, reflecting the complex evolution of Gnosticism in relation to the broader religious milieu of their respective times.
