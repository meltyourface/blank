To respond to this knowledge challenge, it is essential to first understand the historical and social contexts of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and Bram Stoker's "Dracula", the scientific advancements and occult practices prevalent during their respective time periods, and how these factors influenced the authors' perspectives on moral and societal implications. Subsequently, we will identify real historical figures or events that influenced the creation of the main characters' journeys and emotional struggles within the context of the esoteric and supernatural.

1. **Historical and social contexts**

"Frankenstein" was published in 1818 during the Romantic period (late 18th to mid-19th century), which was characterized by a focus on emotion, individualism, and nature. Occult practices, including alchemy and astrology, were popular in the Romantic period, often blending with science in an effort to understand the unknown.

"Dracula" was published in 1897 during the Victorian era (mid to late 19th century). While rationalism and scientific advancements were greatly valued during this era, the society was also immersed in spiritualism due to increasing interest in the unknown, supernatural, and mysterious, particularly concerning death and afterlife.

2. **Scientific advancements and occult practices**

"Frankenstein": The novel was influenced by the scientific advancements of its time, most notably galvanism â€“ the use of electricity to stimulate life in dead organic matter. The protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, seeks to unlock the secret of life by creating a sentient being from dead body parts. Shelley's depiction of Victor's experiments could be seen as a metaphor for the pursuit of forbidden knowledge and the consequences of playing God.

"Dracula": Stoker's novel showcased a more grounded connection between contemporary science and the occult. Characters, like Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward, use contemporary medical practices alongside supernatural knowledge (e.g., the use of garlic, holy water, and the wooden stake) to combat the evil vampire count. This blending of science and superstition demonstrates the struggle between reason and belief in the supernatural during the Victorian era.

3. Authors' perspectives on moral and societal implications

"Frankenstein": Shelley's novel highlights the potential dangers of unchecked scientific ambition and the moral responsibility of the creator. Victor's attempt to breach the boundaries between life and death results in a monster that ultimately brings devastation to him and his loved ones. His failure to take responsibility for his creation reflects the consequences of irresponsibility in scientific pursuits. Moreover, the creature's longing for companionship and acceptance offers a critique of societal norms that ostracize those deemed different or monstrous.

"Dracula": Stoker's work can be interpreted as a reflection of societal anxieties regarding the unknown, otherness, and moral decay. Dracula represents an encroaching, foreign evil that threatens the conventional social order and values. The struggle to defeat him can be seen as an effort to restore moral balance and uphold societal norms. The novel also grapples with the idea of the "New Woman," as embodied by characters such as Mina Harker and Lucy Westenra, highlighting the changing role of women in society.

4. **Real historical figures or events influencing character journeys and emotional struggles**

"Frankenstein": The character of Victor Frankenstein could be partially inspired by real-life figures such as Paracelsus, an alchemist who believed in the potential to create an artificial human; Giovanni Aldini, who conducted electrical experiments on dead bodies; and Erasmus Darwin, Charles Darwin's grandfather, who was rumored to have reanimated dead matter.

"Dracula": The character of Count Dracula is believed to be inspired by Vlad the Impaler (Vlad III), a 15th-century ruler of Wallachia (present-day Romania), and Elizabeth Bathory, a 16th-century Hungarian noblewoman accused of killing young girls and bathing in their blood. These historical figures could have impacted the portrayal of Dracula as a fearsome and cruel antagonist in the novel.

5. **Conclusion**

Shelley's "Frankenstein" and Stoker's "Dracula" showcase authors' perspectives on the moral and societal implications of blending scientific advancements with occult practices. In both novels, the authors encourage readers to consider the consequences of humans trespassing the boundaries between life and death, as well as the impact of societal norms and prejudices. Real historical figures and events influenced the creation of the main characters' journeys and emotional struggles, reminding us that the characters and themes portrayed in these novels have roots in their respective socio-historical contexts.
