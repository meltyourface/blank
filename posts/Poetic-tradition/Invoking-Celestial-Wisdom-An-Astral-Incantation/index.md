excerpt: > 
  Compose an intricate poem in the vein of the Rubaiyat, drawing upon the vast realms of theurgy and ceremonial magic. Immerse yourself in the world of arcane practices and ancient incantations, and incorporate the symbolic language of the occult into your verses. Delve into the aesthetics of the Poetic tradition, and emulate the timeless rhyming pattern of AABA within each quatrain. As you weave your words, embody the mystic ambience of the enigmatic art, invoking deities and celestial forces to manifest your creative vision. Remember to imbue your creation with esoteric knowledge, blending intricate symbolism and sacred geometries to construct a literary labyrinth of magical enchantment.

I

In the midnight realm of secrets hid,
Where silent ciphers 'round us slither,
Enshrined in shadow, an obelisk amid,
Arcana whispering, as the pale moon quivers.

II

The celestial script, an art most rare,
Encircles us with serpentine complexities,
As each incantation hangs in the air,
Our thoughts entwined in sacred symmetries.

III

In reverence, I invoke Thee, Oh Great Aether,
Emblazon my essence with Thine celestial fire,
Illumine my mind with arcane wisdom, my tether,
To the realms of enchantment, where gods conspire.

IV

To Mercury, noble messenger of skies,
Grant me thy winged sandals for a span,
Lend me thy voice, swift Hermes, as I rise
To worlds concealed from the mortal ken.

V

Visions of Hecate emerge from that void,
As baying hounds lead the shadows' dance,
Torch held high, at the crossroads now I stand,
Beseeching guidance on this path of chance.

VI

Beneath the cloak of Nyx, behold the forms,
In sacred geometry, their power concealed,
From Pythagorean patterns, secrets are torn,
As silvered moonlight casts the runes unsealed.

VII

I raise my cup, libations to the Seven,
Who guide me on this astral sojourn,
Sacred Elixirs blend—sweet gifts from heaven—
Theurgic incantations for me adjourn.

VIII

Through swirling mysteries, I navigate,
Awash in symbolism's rich embrace,
In lunar chambers, the divine await
As I traverse the labyrinth of time and space.
