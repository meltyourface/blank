You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Design a ritualistic system of spirit work correspondences tailored for each day of the week, utilizing specific occult symbolism, planetary associations, and elemental energies. For each day, incorporate unique examples of sigils, invocations, and offerings that align with the day's spiritual influences and foster complex and immersive rituals that enable a deep connection to the metaphysical realm.
