1. **Three specific spirits**: a. **Vothkari**: A spirit of knowledge, particularly of lost and ancient civilizations. Vothkari is known for their vast wisdom and guidance to those who seek to uncover the mysteries of the past. b. **Yeristia**: A spirit associated with nature and the elements, specifically with the power of weather and environmental balance. Yeristia has a nurturing and protective aspect, especially towards those with a connection to the natural world. c. **Zalendra**: A spirit of creativity, inspiration, and artistic expression. Zalendra is often invoked by artists, writers, and musicians to help them unlock their true potential and overcome creative blocks.

2. **Ritual components and tools**: a. **Vothkari**: Sandalwood incense, an antique book, and a carved stone amulet featuring ancient symbols. b. **Yeristia**: Lavender incense, a wooden staff adorned with feathers and ribbons, and a bowl of water collected from a natural spring or river. c. **Zalendra**: Jasmine incense, a paintbrush, a sketchbook, and a small item representing their chosen artistic medium (e.g., a quill pen, a musical instrument, etc.).

3. **Invocation scripts**: a. **Vothkari**: "Keeper of lost secrets and ancient wisdom, Vothkari, I call upon you to impart your knowledge and guide me in my quest for understanding. By the power of the written word and the symbols of the ancients, I beseech thee to reveal the mysteries hidden deep within the sands of time." b. **Yeristia**: "Guardian of the natural world, Yeristia, I summon you to bring balance and harmony to the elements around me. Through your connection with the Earth and Sky, imbue me with your strength and energy to protect and nurture all living beings." c. **Zalendra**: "Muse of creativity and inspiration, Zalendra, I invite you to share your divine spark with me. Ignite my artistic spirit with your brilliance, that I may create works of everlasting beauty and profound meaning."

4. **Sequence of actions**: a. **Grounding**: Begin with a deep breathing exercise, connecting with the energies of the earth and drawing them upwards into your being. b. **Consecration**: Light candles and incense, and cleanse your sacred space by smudging with white sage or other purifying herbs. c. **Delineation of sacred space**: Cast a circle around your workspace using a wand, staff, or your finger, envisioning a barrier of protective energy.

5. **Visualization techniques**: a. **Vothkari**: Open the antique book, and visualize yourself entering into its pages, connecting with the spirit through the words and symbols contained therein. b. **Yeristia**: Hold the wooden staff and imagine yourself rooted like a tree, with your energy flowing through the ground, connecting with the spirit of Yeristia in the heart of the Earth. c. **Zalendra**: Gaze upon the artistic item, and let your creativity flow into the item, envisioning it as a channel for Zalendra's energy to intermingle with yours.

6. **Banishing rituals**: a. **Vothkari**: "Vothkari, I thank you for your wisdom and guidance. As the sands return to the desert, so do I release you from our communion. Go in peace." b. **Yeristia**: "Yeristia, I express my deepest gratitude for your nurturing presence. As the waters flow back to their source, so do I release you to the embrace of the Earth. Farewell, and may our paths meet again." c. **Zalendra**: "Zalendra, I am grateful for the creative light you have imbued within me. As the colors of a masterpiece fade into time, so do I release you from our union. Thank you, and travel well on your journey."

7. **Reflection and documentation**: After completing the ceremony, spend some time meditating on your experience and take note of any insights, messages, or unusual occurrences. Record all relevant information in your dedicated spirit work journal, allowing you to reflect upon and learn from your experiences with these powerful entities.
