In response to the knowledge challenge posed, it is essential to explore the key factors and archetypes that shape the development and manifestation of spiritual and occult gifts within an initiate. To do this, we shall first identify specific factors and archetypes, followed by an exploration of their interrelationships and roles in the holistic development of an individual's inherent spiritual and occult potential.

The Key Factors and Archetypes:

1. Innate talent: Just as with any skill or gift, spiritual and occult abilities are influenced by a certain degree of innate talent or predisposition. The innate talent serves as the seed for one's spiritual or occult potential.

2. Personal experiences: Life experiences, past traumas, and the individual's own spiritual journey play crucial roles in shaping their spiritual and occult abilities. Individual encounters with the unknown, the esoteric, or the divine can leave lasting impressions that enhance their spiritual potential.

3. Spiritual or occult guidance: Teachers, gurus, mentors, or even texts and so-called "grimoires," can help initiates develop their gifts further and ensure their talents are appropriately channeled.

4. Archetype of the Magician: The Magician archetype, as depicted by Carl Jung, is a powerful inner figure that embodies knowledge and power. The Magician's role is to guide initiates through their spiritual and occult journey by imparting wisdom, initiating transformation, and urging the initiate to confront the unknown.

5. Archetype of the Healer: The Healer archetype represents the restorative aspects of the initiate's spiritual journey. It aids in healing emotional, mental, and spiritual wounds while also guiding initiates towards self-realization and wholeness.

6. Archetype of the Trickster: The Trickster acts as a catalyst for growth and transformation by challenging preconceptions, shaking up the status quo, and introducing elements of chaos and unpredictability.

7. Synchronicity: Coined by Carl Jung, synchronicity refers to the occurrence of meaningful coincidences that guide initiates on their spiritual path and provide affirmation that they are on the right track.

Interrelations of factors and archetypes:

The aforementioned factors and archetypes interrelate to form a rich tapestry of influence in the development of spiritual and occult gifts. Each factor and archetype has its role to play in the overall harmony of an initiate's spiritual growth.

Innate talent, personal experiences, and guidance intertwine to create a solid foundation for the development of these gifts. Personal experiences and guidance can be enriched with synchronicity, which provides a supportive environment for talents to flourish. Simultaneously, the interplay between the Magician, Healer, and Trickster archetypes brings balance to the initiate's journey.

The Magician imparts knowledge and wisdom, the Healer restores the individual's emotional and mental well-being, and the Trickster instigates transformation. The roles of the archetypes constantly shift as the initiate moves along their spiritual path, echoing the dynamic nature of spiritual and occult development.

Together, these factors and archetypes form a complex, multi-dimensional framework that governs the unfolding of spiritual and occult gifts within an individual.

In conclusion, the development and manifestation of spiritual and occult gifts in an initiate are governed by a delicate interplay of factors and archetypes. Innate talent, personal experiences, spiritual guidance, the Magician, the Healer, the Trickster, and synchronicity all come together in a dynamic, ever-evolving tapestry that guides the initiate on their path of self-discovery and growth. By understanding the roles and relationships between these elements, one can better comprehend the intricacies of spiritual and occult development and work towards realizing the full potential of their innate abilities.
