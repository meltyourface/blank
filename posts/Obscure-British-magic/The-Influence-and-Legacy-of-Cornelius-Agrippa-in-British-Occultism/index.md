Cornelius Agrippa is a towering figure in the history of esotericism and particularly in the development of Obscure British magic. His highly influential works, especially "Three Books of Occult Philosophy," played a significant role in shaping the practices and theories of British magicians. 

Practical applications of Agrippa's works are most evident in his exploration of the natural, celestial, and intellectual worlds, which provide a comprehensive framework for modern ritualistic ceremonies. In the natural world, Agrippa delineated the significance of understanding the elements (earth, air, fire, water) and their respective qualities. He also emphasized the relationship between celestial bodies like planets, stars, and zodiac signs and their potential influences on the magical practitioner. In the intellectual realm, Agrippa's focus on theurgy – the practice of invoking the divine – has laid vital groundwork for modern British magical practices that revolve around evoking and invoking deities and spirits.

Modern-day rituals can benefit immensely from Agrippa's theories by incorporating these elements into ceremonial practices. For instance, Agrippa's comprehensive understanding of planetary influences may be employed to determine the optimal timing of rituals according to astrological alignments. Additionally, practitioners can integrate his understanding of elements to balance the energetic forces present in a ceremony. Also, utilizing sigils and talismans imbued with power drawn from Agrippa's writings, ritualists may forge potent connections with the spiritual realm.

Notable occult figures in the British tradition, such as John Dee and Edward Kelley, were directly inspired by Agrippa's concepts of the intellectual world and theurgy. Their development of Enochian magic that involves communication with angels can trace its roots to Agrippa's influence. Additionally, figures like Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, and several members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were heavily influenced by Agrippa's contributions. Thus, the legacy of Agrippa's works on Occult Philosophy can be observed in many branches of British magical tradition.

Another example of Agrippa's influence can be seen in the widespread use of the Qabalah (Kabbalah) within British esoteric practices. The Qabalah provides a mystical and theoretical framework that aids practitioners in understanding their personal connection to the divine – a concept rooted in Agrippa's notions of theurgy and divine communication.

In summary, Cornelius Agrippa's works remain a cornerstone of Obscure British magic, shaping the practices and theories that continue in the tradition today. Through his deep exploration of the natural, celestial, and intellectual worlds, Agrippa has provided essential knowledge for modern ritualistic ceremonies, enabling a continued connection to divine energies. The impact of Agrippa's work can be traced through notable occult figures and their respective practices, which demonstrates the richness and ongoing influence of his contributions to the enigmatic world of British magic.
