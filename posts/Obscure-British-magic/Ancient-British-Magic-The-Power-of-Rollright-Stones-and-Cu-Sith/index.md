In order to fully grasp the impact of the Rollright Stones and the legends of the Cu Sith on the development of Obscure British magic and to deduce how initiates may draw upon these elements for effective spellwork, we must begin by examining each element individually before considering how they complement and influence each other. Consequently, we can then identify the connections between the stones and the mythical creature, further revealing how practitioners of Occult British magic can tap into these ancient sources of power and wisdom.

The Rollright Stones, a prehistoric stone circle situated in England, are believed to be a powerful source of magical energy, dating back to Neolithic and Bronze Age periods. They are shrouded by legends that detail the transformation of a king and his army into the standing stones that form the circle. This transformation was initiated by a witch, who challenged the king with a riddle, upon which his fate depended. Obscure British magic is deeply connected with the history and mythology of the British Isles, and as such, places of power, such as the Rollright Stones, play a crucial role in the practices and rites of initiates.

The legends of the Cu Sith, on the other hand, stem from Scottish folklore and depict a supernatural, canine creature heralding death and the crossing of the soul into the otherworld. The Cu Sith is an unsettling apparition with its eerie howl, massive size, and dark-green coloration, and is perceived as a psychopomp or messenger of the afterlife. The connections of the Cu Sith to the otherworld speak to the transformative nature of Obscure British magic – particularly its capacity to bridge the gaps between realms and manipulate the energies of life and death.

In comparing their influence, scholars of Obscure British magic observe that both the Rollright Stones and the legends of the Cu Sith represent distinct yet interrelated aspects of the magic system. The Rollright Stones embody the tangible, earthly realm – the importance of location, the harnessing of ley lines, and ancient wisdom conferred by the stones themselves. The academic study of the magic performed here revolves around the understanding of the stones' history, the energies they emanate, and their role in rituals and invocations.

Thus, initiates who draw upon the power of the Rollright Stones may perform rites of power rooted in the land itself, channeling the ancient might of those who once stood there as living beings. By understanding the connection between history and place, the practitioner can form spells that resonate with the very essence of the British Isles. Such work may span protective magic, spellcasting focused on the achievement of wisdom and inner transformation, or even in some cases reviving and requesting the aid of ancient spirits who are linked to the site.

The Cu Sith, conversely, represents the intangible, otherworldly aspects of Obscure British magic. For initiates who connect with its themes, their focus may be placed upon divination, exploring the mysteries of life and death, and connecting with the world beyond. The Cu Sith, as a psychopomp, can offer insights into these realms, granting practitioners the power to seek guidance from the otherworld and communicate with spirits. However, drawing upon these energies requires a delicate balance, as the practitioner must navigate the boundaries that separate the living from the dead.

In conclusion, the key themes of the Rollright Stones and the legends of the Cu Sith illustrate the diverse foundations that make up the practice of Obscure British magic. The Rollright Stones represent the earthly, historical, and tangible aspects of this art, while the Cu Sith contributes to the ethereal, otherworldly, and transformative components. Both elements, when properly harnessed, provide initiates with powerful avenues to explore their spellwork.

To effectively use these sources of wisdom, the initiates must study and appreciate the intricacies of each component, integrating the lessons of ancient locations and powerful beings into their everyday practice. By acknowledging the role of history, the magic practitioner taps into the energy of the land and the eons of knowledge that reside within it. Simultaneously, by embracing the mysteries of life and death embodied by the Cu Sith, they can bridge the divide between realms, and delve into the secrets that connect all aspects of existence.
