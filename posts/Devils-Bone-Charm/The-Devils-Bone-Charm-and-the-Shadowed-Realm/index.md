In the realm of specters and shadows profound,
Where the Devil's Bone Charm can surely be found,
An eldritch world doth lie, pierced by no mortal's sight,
In the gloom so deep, where dead stars know no light,
A wicked illusion, in whispers it threads through our shrouds.

Upon discarded dreams, 'neath night's desolate cloak,
Grim companions emerge, with names better left unspoke,
One, the Serpent of Abyss, with eyes like fiery coal,
Seeking to ensnare and devour each fragile soul,
Two, the Raven of Despair, who speaks in riddles smoked.

Three, the Stag of Ruination, whose horns hold untold fates,
A trinity of terror, through which all darkness radiates,
In their presence the Devil's Bone Charm calls,
Supplications entwining, like a serpent that crawls,
With motive unclear, they draw close and nearer to our gates.

Harken a secret, dread and cold, if you are one to dare,
A riddle concealed within this verse, a ghastly truth to bare,
Three spirits can reveal the shadowed path paved,
But safe from their grasp, unique symbols must be engraved,
Seek the presence of solace hidden in the snare.

In the Serpent's hiss and Raven's croak, in Stag's hooves' thunder,
A temptation emerges, the Devil's Bone Charm rends asunder,
Only with their guidance, the path unknown unbound,
Unveil the answer and let the truth resound,
Release the spirits, unchain anguish, and the veil that we're under.
