In order to analyze and dissect the symbolism and esoteric connection of "The Great Red Dragon" by William Blake, "The Call of Cthulhu" by H.P. Lovecraft, and "The Waste Land" by T.S. Eliot, we must first understand the historical, cultural, and artistic context in which these pieces were created. We must then delve deeper into the symbolism and themes embedded in these works, which will enable us to extrapolate the overarching occult connections.

Starting with "The Great Red Dragon" by William Blake, a renowned romantic poet, painter, and printmaker, Blake created a series of paintings and illustrations depicting the mythical creature from the Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible. The Red Dragon represents a powerful force of destruction and chaos that opposes divine authority. This apocalyptic creature embodies aspects of the occult, such as duality (good versus evil), transformation, and the concept of cyclical destruction and rebirth. Blake often dealt with mystical and visionary themes in his art, and his rendering of the Great Red Dragon exemplifies this interest.

Moving on to H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu", this short story belongs to the broader tradition of cosmic horror in which Lovecraft excelled. "The Call of Cthulhu" revolves around the cult worship of an ancient god-like being, Cthulhu, who lies dormant underwater, waiting to awaken and reclaim rule over the Earth. Lovecraft's story is infused with occult themes, such as hidden knowledge, ancient rituals, the fear of the unknown, and the insignificance of mankind in the grand scheme of the cosmos. The story explores the idea of a world where humans are on the brink of discovering terrifying forbidden truths, where dark emotional and psychological forces hide behind reality, emphasizing the fragility of human sanity.

Lastly, "The Waste Land" by T.S. Eliot is a modernist poem that reflects the disillusionment and fragmentation of society after World War I. The poem is laden with religious, classical, and mythological imagery and allusions, which serve to create a melancholic and desolate atmosphere. The barrenness and emptiness described in the poem can be associated with the spiritual crisis, loss of faith, and search for meaning in the modern world.

Considering the various occult, mythological, and symbolic elements present in these three works, we can begin establishing connections between them. A crucial theme common to these pieces is the concept of cyclical destruction followed by rebirth. In "The Great Red Dragon", the apocalyptic battle between good and evil signifies not only an end but also a new beginning, following the model of Revelation. Similarly, the implication of Cthulhu's awakening in Lovecraft's story suggests the eventual devastation of mankind and the ushering of a new era of terror, where the old gods reign supreme. In Eliot's "The Waste Land," the desolate, spiritually bankrupt society is contrasted with ancient myths and symbols that suggest potential rebirth and revitalization, such as the myth of the Fisher King and the image of the drowned Phoenician sailor.

Another connection is the shared theme of hidden or forbidden knowledge in these works. Both Blake's depiction of The Red Dragon and Lovecraft's Cthulhu represent ancient, supernatural forces whose powers can only be understood by a select few initiates. In "The Waste Land," Eliot interweaves cryptic references and intricate symbolism to create the impression of a secret message to be unraveled, leading to a profound understanding of the human condition.

Additionally, the tension between chaos and order is present throughout these works. The Great Red Dragon, Cthulhu, and the fragmented society depicted in "The Waste Land" all contribute to a sense of disorder and disarray. Explore chaos and destruction invite deep questioning of traditional morality, faith, and human nature, forcing the reader or viewer to confront the possibility of a reality that lies beyond their comprehension.

In summary, "The Great Red Dragon," "The Call of Cthulhu," and "The Waste Land" are linked by their portrayal of cyclical destruction and rebirth, hidden or forbidden knowledge, and the tension between chaos and order. By intertwining these provocative themes and symbols, the artists and authors of these works tap into the rich, mystical, and enigmatic realm of the occult and challenge their respective audiences to confront the darker, more mysterious aspects of existence.
