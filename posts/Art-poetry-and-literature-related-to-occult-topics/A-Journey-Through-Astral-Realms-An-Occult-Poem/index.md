Beneath the silver moon's arcane grace, I lay supine on sable sheets sublime,
Invoking ye eldritch powers arcane, I merged with the Other, transcending time,
Ether sung its haunting, lilting song, calling me to traverse the planes unseen,
I, mere vessel of this mortal coil, left my flesh behind, for realms undreamed.

I commence my occult ritual divine, an invocation of the astral form,
Call forth the angelic chorus, beseech the unseen hands to guide me through the storm,
Golden suns, mercurial moons, and Venus' loving arms about me weave,
Embarking now upon my mystic flight, as I embrace the breath of Adamite reprise.

As a serpent coiled around the Tree of Eternity, my consciousness ascends,
My form dissolving into shimmering prisms, whispered secrets to comprehend,
I shed my mortal skin, a chrysalis of blood and bone, gravid with cosmic truth.

In flaxen oceans of a realm untrod, I drift, ephemeral and light as a wraith,
My etheric form an argent silhouette, a lodestone undimmed by time or fate,
There, in this astral realm, I heard the voice of ancient sages speak my name,
Mesmeric shades, their faces fading fast, disintegrated in the astral frame.

A million glittering eyes beheld my course, as I traversed the sea of stars,
Roads unknown and tragic, fraught with peril, sung, amid the silent cosmos ajar,
Resplendent in its ecstasy and fear, the astral plane ensnared my soul entire,
There, I witness mysteries profound, old incarnations perchance forgot in cosmic fire.

Portals with sigils of the mage and the saint, vast gateways to the unknown,
Courting shadows just beyond the threshold, as Enochian tongues filled the air like misty haze,
What arcane words did these forms utter, to wield their influence on the hidden world?
I dared to seek their origin and the truth, each letter spelling the secrets of celestial days.

I journeyed past the Seven-fold Halls of Maâ€™at, where an unborn sun was nurtured,
The Serpent-Headed Goddess dipped her quill, inscribing truths in the scrolls of cosmic youth,
Destinies forged and souls reborn anew, amid the mystic realm where life transfigured.

My sojourn reached its zenith, a room adorned with sigils of the Art,
A grimoire prophesied my journey's end, its wielder bearing knowledge of eidolons,
In his hand, a silver key gleamed with power, unlocking secrets hidden since the dawn of time,
There, radiant and terrible, I beheld my boding sight, the limits of my quest confined.

As this wordless epiphany resided, I joined again the corporeal shrine,
My body knit to flesh and blood once more, like Helios, I arose from my nightly voyage divine,
Secrets collected like constellations, bright and fierce, the truth forever burns within,
An astral projection, a soulful pilgrimage, I'll forever know art and beauty in this transient life.
