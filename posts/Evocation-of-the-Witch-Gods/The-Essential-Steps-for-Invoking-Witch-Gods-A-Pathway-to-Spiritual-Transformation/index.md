To fully respond to the knowledge challenge at hand, we shall delve into the essential principles and steps in the evocation process that would be necessary for an initiate to successfully invoke the Witch Gods. We will also examine the interconnectedness of these principles and steps with the vital aspects of occult symbolism, ancient mythology, and personal transformation during the rite.

### I. Essential Principles & Steps in the Evocation Process

1. Preparation: The first crucial principle to be emphasized is the preparation stage. This involves ritual purification, setting up a sacred space, and acquiring knowledge of the specific Witch God to be invoked.

2. Intention: Following preparation, the next important principle is setting a clear, focused intention for the evocation. This bears significance in directing one's will and energy towards the desired outcome.

3. Invocation: This step involves the actual invocation of the Witch God using specific chants, sigils, and gestures. Here, the initiate establishes a connection with the divine entity and opens a channel for communication.

4. Evocation: During this stage, the initiate must draw forth the energy and presence of the Witch God into their sacred space. This is often achieved through visualization techniques and the use of sacred objects.

5. Communion: Once evocation is accomplished, the initiate then communes with the invoked Witch God. This may involve a telepathic or astral conversation, observance of omens, or other forms of spiritual communication.

6. Integration: The final stage of the process is integration, where the initiate assimilates the insights and energies received from the Witch God into their personal being, grounding these energies into their daily life.

### II. Interconnectedness with Occult Symbolism, Ancient Mythology & Personal Transformation

a. Occult Symbolism: The crucial role of occult symbolism in the evocation process cannot be overstated. Sigils, pentagrams, and elemental symbols all facilitate communication between the initiate and the invoked entity. For example, the use of sigils representing specific Witch Gods establishes a link between the earthly realm and the divine. 

b. Ancient Mythology: Mythological knowledge helps in understanding the nature, history, and attributes of the Witch Gods, allowing the initiator to approach evocation with the appropriate mindset and reverence. Wisdom from ancient myths can also inform the choice of rituals, offerings, and invocations, ensuring that the communication is aligned with the beliefs and energies associated with the Witch God.

c. Personal Transformation: The evocation process, when conducted properly, fosters personal transformation. As the initiate connects with the Witch God and receives insights, their understanding of themselves and the world around them may shift. It is through this process that the initiate undergoes spiritual growth, achieving self-actualization and deepening their connection with the divine. This transformation may manifest in various ways, such as enhanced intuition, altered consciousness, or the acquisition of supernatural abilities.

In conclusion, the essential principles and steps in the evocation process that would be necessary for an initiate to successfully invoke the Witch Gods involve careful preparation, setting a focused intention, invoking the Witch God, evoking their presence, communing with the invoked entity, and integrating received energies and insights. These principles are intrinsically linked to the vital aspects of occult symbolism, ancient mythology, and personal transformation during the rite. By adhering to these guidelines and understanding their interconnectedness, the initiate can ignite a process of profound spiritual growth and transformation.
