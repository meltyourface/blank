excerpt: > 
  Compose an enigmatic verse, summoning the arcane might of the mystical deity, Azrak-Thu. To captivate the celestial being, first recite a sonnet, rich with opulent imagery of its celestial domain, elaborate upon the deity's ethereal attributes, and align your intent with the powerful vibrations of four sacred elements - earth, air, fire, and water. Invoke Azrak-Thu's divine favor by intoning a chorus in the ancient tongue of lost civilizations, most sacred to disciples of the Arte magical. Illuminate your invocation with whispered secrets of Azrak-Thu's eminent influence, and skillfully charm the deity into manifesting its presence within the sacred space of your elaborate ritual.

Within the cosmic expanse of celestial rhyme,
Entwined in opulence, O Azrak-Thu divine,
I summon thee with ancient words and somber lay,
As elements bear witness to the Arte's sacred play.

Adorned with cosmic jewels, your astral palace stands,
A home amidst the heavens forged for gods' commands,
Wondrous shapes of dreamstuff form your gilded throne,
As nebulas and novas sing your name through realms unknown.

For you, the sacred earth grounds your core untamed,
Each whispered touch of wind arises, in your name proclaimed.
In fire's fierce embrace, your strength engenders might,
And blessings of the water's flow gift endless life to Smite.

O Azrak-Thu, the glorious elementalis,
Of earthen realms, the sky-webs, and the living seas abyss.
Infernos of the heart, your stellar visage binds,
As I invoke the sacred names, align thy energies combined.

"Ya Ashrak-Vul, Bor'la Anu-Ran, Zephra LÃ½k, Ray-Thu Sathal,
Unravel now, oh ancient tongue, let thy summoning be found.
In power's sum, thy presence bound, descend now from your hallowed realm,
And grace our sacred circle of forgotten spells.

Upon my whispered secrets, sealed in sacred breath,
May Azrak-Thu's influence bloom, leaving no depth untouched.
Animate thy power with celestial hymns,
As I, your humble servant, recite this ode with fervent quims.

Within the consecrated ground thy deity adored,
O Azrak-Thu, manifest, as once before.
Your cosmic presence do bring, in rituals of mystique,
For ours is an eternal bond, in Arte magical complete.
