To commence with, it is crucial to understand the basic tenets of psychological warfare and occultism. Psychological warfare refers to the use of various strategies, including disinformation, propaganda, and covert tactics, to manipulate the thoughts, beliefs, and emotions of individuals or groups. It is a powerful tool used by governments, military forces, intelligence agencies, and others to achieve strategic objectives, such as facilitating social control or procuring compliance from adversaries. 

Occultism, on the other hand, encompasses a diverse range of beliefs, philosophies, and practices that aim to access hidden, powerful forces that govern the universe and human existence. It seeks to manipulate reality and perception through esoteric knowledge and ritualistic practices. The principles of occultism share similarities with the tactics of psychological warfare, especially with regard to the core objective of altering perception and reality.

The development and usage of psychological warfare in the modern age of war parallel the principles of occultism in several key aspects:

1. Manipulation of perception: Both psychological warfare and occultism seek to control and manipulate the perception of individuals or groups. In warfare, psychological operations are employed to disseminate disinformation, create confusion, and lower adversaries' morale. Similarly, occult practitioners believe that altering perception is paramount to harnessing supernatural forces and effecting desirable change.

**Example**: During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union engaged in extensive psychological warfare campaigns to discredit each other's ideologies and bolster their global influence. This aligns with occult principles where practitioners employ rituals or techniques to alter their perceptions and gain mastery over the forces of nature.

2. Exploitation of hidden knowledge: Psychological warfare and occultism both rely on the acquisition and application of clandestine or esoteric knowledge. In warfare, intelligence agencies and military forces invest heavily in gathering secret or sensitive information to maintain a strategic advantage. Occultists, too, delve into forbidden or arcane knowledge to develop their abilities.

**Example**: Intelligence agencies routinely use clandestine surveillance and espionage to uncover enemy secrets. In the realm of the occult, practitioners like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn relied on mysterious texts, such as the Egyptian 'Book of the Dead,' to gain insights into the afterlife and the operation of cosmic forces.

3. Challenges to individual freedom and personal sovereignty: Psychological warfare inherently challenges the principles of individual freedom and personal sovereignty by manipulating the beliefs and emotions of individuals or communities. Occultism also places the practitioner in a position of power over others by granting them the ability to influence events and individuals in ways that often defy conventional understanding or ethical norms.

**Example**: The usage of subliminal messaging, a technique employed in psychological warfare, overrides an individual's freedom by affecting their subconscious mind without their conscious knowledge. This invasion can be likened to the use of enchantments or curses in the occult, which may exert similar control over the intended target.

In summary, the development and usage of psychological warfare in the modern age share common threads with the principles of occultism, specifically in the manipulation of perception, exploitation of hidden knowledge, and the challenge it poses to individual freedom and personal sovereignty. Both realms emphasize the importance of understanding and controlling forces that lie beneath the surface of perceptible reality. Though they differ in terms of methodology and goals, the parallels between psychological warfare and occultism showcase the timeless human desire to influence outcomes, control perceptions, and wield power over the unknown.
