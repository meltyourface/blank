Based on the task provided, I will assume the deceased's native land as Japan and create a comprehensive funeral feast menu accordingly. However, do note that I can modify this menu to cater to any specific culture or preferences upon request. 

Japanese Funeral Feast Menu:

### I. **Appetizers**:
1. **Zoni (お雑煮)**: A traditional Japanese soup consisting of vegetables, tofu, and mochi rice cakes, often served at funerals and symbolizing good fortun, unity, and purity.
2. **Chawanmushi (茶碗蒸し)**: A delicate and savory steamed egg custard dish featuring vegetables, chicken, and shrimp; this dish symbolizes nourishment and comfort.

### II. **Main Courses**:
1. **Sushi & Sashimi Platter (寿司 & 刺身)**: A selection of various raw fish, seafood, and sushi rolls representing the abundance and freshness of the Japanese coastal regions.
2. **Osama Nabe (鴛鴦鍋)**: A warm and nourishing hot pot featuring meat, seafood, vegetables, and tofu simmered together, highlighting the concept of togetherness and unity in times of grief and remembrance.
3. **Yakitori (焼き鳥)**: Grilled chicken skewers glazed with a sweet and savory sauce, symbolizing the culinary traditions of Japan and the nurturing qualities of the deceased.

### III. **Desserts**:
1. **Kuzumochi (葛餅)**: A comforting dish made from kuzu root starch, representing ancestral traditions and the sweetness of life's memories.
2. **Anmitsu (あんみつ)**: A colorful dessert with a fruit jelly base, sweet red bean paste, and a drizzle of brown sugar syrup, embodying the harmony and beauty of Japanese aesthetic values.

### IV. **Beverages**:
1. **Ochazuke (お茶漬け)**: A warm blend of green tea poured over cooked rice and garnished with toasted seaweed, showcasing the revitalizing qualities of traditional Japanese tea ceremonies.
2. **Sake (日本酒)**: Traditional Japanese rice wine, served to toast in honor of the deceased's life and memory. It represents the spiritual bond between the living and the departed. (This option can be replaced with a non-alcoholic alternative like Amazake)
3. **Mizuda (水茶)**: Simplicity and purity are expressed through this plain but vital beverage, signifying the importance of basic nourishment and support during times of grief.

In terms of presentation, each dish should be served on simple yet elegant ceramic or lacquerware vessels, with fresh seasonal flowers and greenery subtly incorporated to uplift the atmosphere. The use of local, high-quality ingredients and traditional Japanese cooking techniques is essential to evoke a sense of connection to the deceased's roots and a genuine appreciation for their cultural heritage. Ultimately, the feast should be a harmonious blend of flavors, textures, and visual elements that bring comfort and solace to the bereaved, while upholding the principles of respect and reverence inherent in Japanese funeral rites.
