To respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first analyze the individual themes of paganism, sexual mysticism, and the boundaries between science and the supernatural. Then, we can consider how these themes intertwine within Arthur Machen's novella "The Great God Pan" to provide the reader with a profound understanding of Machen's occult philosophy and its impact on esoteric traditions.

1. **Paganism**:
Paganism is a term used to describe various pre-Christian religious and spiritual practices. In the case of "The Great God Pan," paganism is predominantly represented through the figure of the ancient Greek god Pan, who embodies nature, physicality, and sensuality. Pan symbolizes a primal and instinctual form of spirituality that contrasts with the more rational and moralistic worldview of the Victorian era in which Machen wrote.

2. **Sexual mysticism**:
Sexual mysticism refers to the use of sexual expression and experiences as a means of achieving spiritual transcendence and communion with the divine. In "The Great God Pan," the character of Helen Vaughan represents a confluence of sexuality and spiritual power. She is endowed with supernatural abilities and knowledge, which she uses to seduce men, corrupt their minds, and ultimately drive them to madness and death.

3. **Boundaries between science and the supernatural**:
"The Great God Pan" approaches the supernatural and the scientific through the character of Dr. Raymond, a scientist and philosopher who conducts controversial experiments on the human brain. His ambition is to cross the boundaries between the material and the spiritual. In doing so, he unleashes Helen Vaughan, a half-human, half-divine being, who becomes an embodiment of the overlap between the scientific and the supernatural.

Intertwining of themes and their impact on esoteric traditions:
In "The Great God Pan," the three themes of paganism, sexual mysticism, and the boundaries between science and the supernatural converge to provide a profound understanding of Machen's occult philosophy.

The character of Helen Vaughan embodies the overlapping aspects of these themes, as she represents both the primal sensuality of the pagan god Pan and the spiritual power gained through sexual mysticism. At the same time, her existence is a result of Dr. Raymond's scientific meddling in the borderland between the material and the spiritual.

Machen's portrayal of the interplay between the pagan, the mystical, and the scientific suggests that the path to a higher knowledge or spiritual awakening is fraught with danger and potential corruption. This complexity is echoed in several esoteric traditions, such as Hermeticism and Theosophy, where the pursuit of hidden knowledge often requires venturing into realms beyond the mundane.

Furthermore, Machen's exploration of these themes in "The Great God Pan" has undoubtedly influenced modern esoteric and occult practices. Contemporary practitioners of magic often draw inspiration from works like this, which reflect a nuanced and multidimensional understanding of the intersections between various spiritual and scientific perspectives.

In conclusion, Arthur Machen's novella "The Great God Pan" intertwines the themes of paganism, sexual mysticism, and the boundaries between science and the supernatural, ultimately providing the reader with a profound understanding of Machen's occult philosophy and its impact on esoteric traditions. The novella delves into primal spirituality, mystic sexuality, and scientific ambition, suggesting that the path to transcending the material world is complex and fraught with potential danger. Machen's work has left a lasting influence on modern occultism and esoteric practices, demonstrating the depth and breadth of his understanding of the hidden aspects of human experience.
