In order to perform the intricate procedure of summoning an enigmatic spirit or deity from the realm of the occult, one must adhere to the following steps with diligence, precision, and unwavering focus.

1. Choosing the Entity: First, begin with accurately identifying the specific spirit or deity that resonates with your intentions and desired outcomes. Delve deep into esoteric and mythological texts to learn about various entities, their attributes, and domains of influence. Select the one that aligns with your purpose and establish a connection by meditating on their qualities and visualizing their form.

2. Gathering Materials: Gather all necessary tools, such as robes, candles, incense, and any specific ritual items associated with your chosen entity. These may include a ritual dagger, chalice, or certain herbs and stones. Additionally, you must acquire a suitable offering as a symbol of gratitude to the summoned presence. This could range from a small token of food and drink to a grander gift, based on the nature of the entity and your resources.

3. Preparing Ritual Sigils: Acquire or create the sacred sigil that corresponds with your chosen spirit or deity. This may be found within ancient grimoires or crafted using your intuition and creative powers. Ensure the sigil is drawn accurately, as it represents the essence of the entity and serves as a gateway for their presence.

4. Selecting Time and Location: The chosen date and time for the ritual must be in alignment with celestial or symbolic events that are conducive to summoning. This may include full moons, equinoxes, or auspicious anniversaries. Select a location that offers both privacy and a proper energetic atmosphere, such as a secluded forest or sacred site known for its supernatural activity.

5. Setting up Protective Measures: Prior to the ritual, outline a circle around the ritual area using salt, chalk, or stones to serve as a barrier between the physical world and the invoked presence. This circle also provides safety for the practitioner, shielding them from harmful energies that may manifest during the summoning process.

6. Performing the Invocation: Cleansed and dressed in your ceremonial attire, step into the circle and light candles and incense to set an appropriate atmosphere. Begin the ritual by calling upon a higher power aligned with your intentions, such as archangels, ancestors, or spirit guides. This will create a protective layer while establishing your connection to the spiritual plane.

7. Channeling the Entity's Energy: With your ritual tools in hand, present the offering and recite the invocation carefully and with conviction. Invoke the name of the entity along with their attributes, summoning their presence through the sigil. As you chant, visualize the energy around you growing stronger, manifesting the entity's essence within the circle.

8. Communicating with the Invoked Presence: Once the energy has peaked and the presence of the entity is palpable, respectfully and humbly engage in communication with the spirit or deity. Share your intentions, desires, and requests, but also be open to listening intently to any wisdom or guidance they may have to offer. Maintain a respectful and focused demeanor throughout the exchange.

9. Closing the Ritual: Upon concluding your communication, express gratitude toward the summoned presence and the higher power initially invoked. Request that the entity return from whence they came, and visualize the energy within the circle dissipating as they depart. Extinguish the candles and incense, symbolizing the seal of the ritual's completion.

10. Cleansing and Grounding: After the ritual, perform a purification ritual, such as smudging with sage, to cleanse both your aura and the space. Consume some nourishing food and drink to ground yourself back into the physical realm, reflecting on the insights received during your exchange with the enigmatic spirit or deity.

Remember to approach this process with reverence, determination, and responsibility, as improper or negligent handling can result in unintended consequences. Engage only in summoning practices that align with your moral and ethical codes, and exercise discretion regarding your experiences and knowledge within the realm of the occult.
