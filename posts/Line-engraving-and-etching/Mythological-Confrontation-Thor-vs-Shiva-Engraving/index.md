The scene should express both visually and symbolically the essence of each character and their mythological backgrounds. The artwork must incorporate finely crafted details, including overlapping lines, textures, and shading to represent each figure's storylines, emotional depth, and realm from which they originate.

With my expertise in Line engraving and etching, I am able to bring to life the detailed and intricate nature of a piece incorporating various mythological figures interacting within the confines of the engraving. I am limited to describing the process and final imagery here, but the actual artwork would be a complex, visual masterpiece.

For this masterpiece, I have chosen four figures with rich mythological backgrounds: Thor, the Norse god of thunder; Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and rebirth; Anubis, the Egyptian god of the afterlife; and Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and war.

The piece is set in a massive temple that is architecturally inspired by the various mythological realms each character is associated with. The temple's columns are ornately carved with heavenly bodies and cosmic symbols, reflecting the grandiosity of the divine realms. The sky is depicted as a mix of thunderstorms and illusory etchings, highlighting the dominance of their respective mythologies.

At the center of the scene, we find Thor and Shiva locked in an epic confrontation that exhibits the sheer power of both deities. Using closely spaced and highly intricate line work, along with a variety of shading techniques, the crackling energies of Thor's Mj√∂lnir and Shiva's Trishul are rendered spectacularly as they clash in a display of divine power. Beneath their feet lies a blend of iconic Norse and Indian cultural symbols, emphasizing their origins and highlighting the fusion of their mythological worlds.

To the left, Anubis stands solemnly by the temple doors, his distinct jackal-headed appearance meticulously rendered by etching fine lines and shapes into the copper plate. The exquisite shading and chiseled textures of the scene indicate his connection to the deserts of Egypt and his role in ushering souls from the world of the living to the afterlife. An ornate scale rests near Anubis, alluding to his role in weighing the hearts of the deceased against the weight of truth. Rays of light are faintly etched surrounding him, intertwining with the divine essence of the other mythological figures.

On the right side, we find the poised and composed Athena, her wise eyes gazing upon the events unfolding. Replete with fine line work, texture, and shading techniques, her armor, spear, and the ever-vigilant owl perched on her shoulder embody her wisdom and prowess in battle. Olive branches weaving in and out of the pillars depict her relation to Athens and the symbol of peace.

Hidden throughout the piece are various symbols associated with each mythology. For example, the Egyptian eye of Horus interweaves with the Norse Valknut, highlighting the interconnected nature of both realms and the overlap between life and death.

Overall, this masterful line engraving and etching delves into the powerful interaction between these mythological figures, evoking their essence, and capturing the depth of their storied backgrounds.
