Upon examining the renowned occult poem "The Dance of Death," we venture into the haunting world of the ethereal dance, taking place beneath the nocturnal canopy. The poem's mystifying structure and eerie cadence have bewitched readers for centuries, luring them into the embrace of its fatal allure.

**Meter analysis**: Throughout the verses, a consistent iambic tetrameter is employed. This meter consists of four iambs per line, where the stress falls on the even syllables. It creates an ebbing and flowing pulse, perfectly encapsulating the undulating rhythm of the macabre waltz.

**Rhyme scheme**: The poem's stanzaic structure consists of quatrains, and the rhyme scheme follows an alternating pattern of ABAB. This pattern effectively bolsters the sense of an otherworldly dance, each couplet taking a turn, and then allowing its partner to step in.

In the opening stanza, the dimly illuminated scene is set, with the nocturnal canopy providing an enchanting backdrop for the dance:

In twilight's embrace, shadows play (A)
Beneath the moonâ€™s ethereal ray (B)
As Death conducts the night's ballet (A)
And souls in spectral waltz sway (B)

Here, we witness the eerie sway of the soul's spectral waltz, the words folding and unfurling in solemn, hypnotic cadences. The poem's meter enhances the sense of movement, guiding us through the dance with a gentle, ghostly rhythm.

As we delve further into the poem, the fatal allure intensifies:

With spectral grace, they spin and twine (A)
Inextricably, fate doth bind (B)
The living, dead, the intertwined (A)
In danse macabre, all souls confined (B)

In this stanza, we see the interconnectedness of life and death displayed, as the ethereal waltz serves as a metaphor for the cycle of existence. The poem's structure supports the complexity of this dance of fate. The ABAB rhyme scheme has a mesmerizing effect that draws readers further into the realm of the occult.

In conclusion, "The Dance of Death" employs a captivating iambic tetrameter and an alternating ABAB rhyme scheme to weave a hypnotic, ethereal tapestry of the danse macabre. The poem's structure and meter enhance the verses' fatal allure, allowing readers to experience the chilling beauty of the occult world masterfully depicted in this classic piece of literature.
