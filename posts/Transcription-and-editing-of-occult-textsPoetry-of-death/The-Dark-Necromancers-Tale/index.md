## I. In Pursuit of the Unholy Grimoire

In the dusk of life where shadows linger,
A zealous soul did dare, in galleries obscure,
To seek forgotten secrets, dark and sinister,
By ancient whispers called, consumed by lust, impure.

The nameless corridors, blood in seclusion,
With cryptic vaults unveiled, eager hands disclosed,
The eldritch tomes, bound in dread occlusion,
Where knowledge forbidden dwelt, in death's repose.

Deep into the musty chambers, plagued by somber air,
A nameless hush possessed the darkling halls,
Unbeknownst of mortal purview, the secrets buried there,
Were guarded, not without a reason, within ancient walls.

### II. The Preternatural Pact

In the void of night, when twilight bade farewell,
The seeker's eye beheld, the formless gate,
To barter with dread beings, a tale none dare to tell,
Their twisted offers echoed, as they spun a dreadful fate.

Luminous shades, twisted and writhing,
From shadows emerged, with mortals' doom they spoke,
Advancing oaths of yore, with terror tying,
Their fiendish deals entwined, the seeker's spirit broke.

Possessed by these spirits vile, he orchestrated,
Forbidden rituals, 'neath the moonless sky,
A soul eviscerated, lost to time, igneous unabated,
In binding grim allegiance, he heard the wailing cry.

### III. The Sanguine Harvest

The hour had arrived, dread rituals in effect,
The necromancer gleaned, with eyes alight,
A hapless life he took, his soul to dissect,
And draw unto him the trembling life's aegis.

Innocent blood, a torrent flowed anew,
From quivering veins, pooling in crimson tide,
Reveling in the anguish of a life untrue,
Instilling necrotic power, the adept's sense deride.

Faces unblemished, gave birth to twisted forms,
Visions of ghastly torment, into his mind impressed,
No salvation, he reached, and life he scorns,
But the dark delight in death, he now possessed.

### IV. The Undying Sovereign

In twilight's waning glimmer, ungodly legions stood,
Ghastly specters of the past, their necrotic lord,
The undead hordes, poised to march on lands once good,
As the sovereign reveled in his gained horde.

For aeons lost, the shadows waxed and waned,
With a sigh born of ages, they called to cease,
The undead reveled, fettered by an iron-toothed chain,
With howls of defeat, they bode the necromancer peace.

A twisted throne, atop the slumber of the dead,
The monarch anointed, ascended to a harrowing plane,
As instruments of fear played, a chorus of dread,
The hallowed puppeteer danced to the cadence of the slain.
