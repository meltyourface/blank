Answering this knowledge challenge requires a deep understanding of the esoteric, occult, transcription, and editing, as well as a comprehensive knowledge of the poetry of death and the underlying correspondences involved. **By following a step-by-step process, we can successfully interpret complex symbology, esoteric language, and interwoven correspondences, and unveil the transformative knowledge contained within an ancient occult text on the poetry of death. Here are the steps that will be taken to accomplish this task**:

1. **Research and study**: First, research and study the historical context, cultural influences, major personalities, and philosophical doctrines associated with the specific occult tradition. This provides a solid foundation for understanding the text and the context within which it was written.

2. **Source evaluation**: Assess the credibility and authenticity of the primary text and its sources. This may require comparing it with other copies or editions, as well as ensuring that the text is not a modern fabrication.

3. **Preliminary transcription**: The transcription process necessitates a meticulous and patient approach. If the text is not in a modern script, this step may require learning the script, proper use of tools, and developing an initial transcription based on the most accurate copy of the original text available.

4. **Basic understanding**: Identify the surface structure, major themes, and general contents of the text. This enables a holistic view of the text, even before delving into the deeper, esoteric layers.

5. **Identify patterns**: Recognize recurring symbols, motifs, phrases, and other patterns in the text. These patterns often have a symbolic, multi-layered significance, reflecting important esoteric principles.

6. **Dictionary and grammar**: Develop a dictionary of key terms, phrases, and symbols, as well as a grammar of the esoteric language at play in the text. This can be achieved through an iterative process of deciphering esoteric language and cross-referencing other texts and resources.

7. **Decoding symbology**: Some occult texts employ encryption techniques, substitution ciphers, and other methods to hide knowledge. Identifying and decoding these elements requires understanding cryptographic techniques, numerology, gematria, or any other relevant method employed.

8. **Stepwise exegesis**: Break down the text into smaller units for more focused exegesis. This may include rearranging or recontextualizing elements to unlock the text's deeper meanings, drawing on the grammar and dictionary developed earlier.

9. **Comparative analysis**: Compare the text with other esoteric works to identify parallel concepts and interpretive keys. Occult traditions often influenced each other, and understanding these crossovers can help elucidate the text's deeper layers.

10. **Synthesis**: Integrate the exegesis and interpretations into a comprehensible whole. This stage might involve editing, refining the translation, and contextualizing the information for a contemporary audience to preserve the text's potency and integrity.

11. **Verification**: Consult with other experts, practitioners, and scholars for feedback to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and clarity of the interpretation.

12. **Summary and conclusions**: Summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions derived from the transcription and interpretation process, clarifying any lingering ambiguities and noting the potential limitations of the analysis.

In conclusion, unveiling the transformative knowledge contained within an ancient occult text on the poetry of death requires deep knowledge, meticulous methodology, and the willingness to engage with the text on multiple levels. With the step-by-step process outlined above, we can identify and interpret complex symbology, esoteric language, and interwoven correspondences, ultimately unveiling the transformative knowledge without compromising the text's inherent integrity and potency.
