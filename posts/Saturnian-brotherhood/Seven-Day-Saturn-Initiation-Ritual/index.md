Day 1: Initiation Ritual
1. Begin by selecting and consecrating the appropriate sigils, talismans, and ritual tools, such as a lead disk engraved with the seal of Saturn, a lead planetary talisman, a black ritual robe, an athame, and a chalice filled with water from a secluded well or spring. Perform a purification ritual to cleanse and empower the ritual space.

2. Invocation of the Saturnian deities and spirits: "Zarazibana kharmakton, oratus Seterniel! Fargast et ghorepan, Vibronic Mater-Saturnia!" Call upon the gods, spirits, and energies associated with Saturn, such as Seterniel, the ancient spirit of Saturn, and the Mater-Saturnia, the esoteric energies of transformation and endurance.

3. The first-day ritual should commence during the hour of Saturn, with the planet ideally placed within the 1st or 10th house of the practitioner's natal chart. This will enhance the potency of the initiation ritual.

4. Offer a libation of dark red wine to Seterniel and the Mater-Saturnia, alongside a small offering of wood or coal ash as a symbol of perseverance through hardship.

5. Perform an initiation ritual to open the 7-day working period, such as a self-anointment with consecrated oils while reciting Saturnian mantras, intoning sigils, or visualizing the ingress of Saturnian vibrations into one's energy field.

Day 2-6: Daily Ritual Progression
1. Maintain your Saturnian altar, meditate daily on the nature of Saturn, and integrate the various materials, such as the writings of Agrippa or the Picatrix, into your daily activities.

2. Invoke the various Saturnian deities and spirits each day during the appropriate Saturnine hours, progressively deepening your connection to these forces.

3. Each day, perform an act of sacrifice or prostration in line with Saturnian energies and principles. Examples include acts of charity, fasting, or enduring physical discomfort in a controlled and purposeful manner.

Day 7: Culmination Ritual
1. On the seventh day, perform the climactic culmination ritual, recapitulating the invocations, offerings, and sacrifices made thus far, and beseeching the Saturnian forces to fully attune, assimilate, and empower the practitioner with their wisdom and potency.

2. Perform a closing ceremony, offering thanks and gratitude to the invoked Saturnian deities, spirits and energies, and grounding any excess vibrations with a series of ritual gestures, chants, or visualizations.

Post-completion: Integration and Grounding
1. Following the culmination ritual, allocate a period of quiet introspection and meditation, focusing on incorporating the Saturnian energies into one's own energetic matrix.

2. Record and document any oracular visions, psychic experiences, or transformative encounters experienced throughout this 7-day working.

3. Engage in a gradual reintroduction of regular activities, while maintaining heightened awareness and continued integration of the Saturnian forces in the days and weeks that follow.

Throughout the entirety of this 7-day Saturnian working, record, document, and ruminate upon each aspect of the process in a ritual journal. This detailed account of the procedural steps and experiential insights will serve future generations and adepts of the Saturnian brotherhood, as they embark upon their own spiritual advancement and attainment of Saturnian mastery.
