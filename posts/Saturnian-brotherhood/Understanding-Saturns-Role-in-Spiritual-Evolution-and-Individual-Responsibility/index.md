To answer this knowledge challenge, let's begin by breaking it down into different components: the symbology of Saturn, its astrological significance, esoteric underpinnings relating to the passage of time and karmic law, and finally, its influence on the teachings and practices within the Saturnian brotherhood. We will then synthesize these elements to understand how they contribute to spiritual evolution and individual responsibility.

1. Symbology of Saturn

Saturn's symbol is represented by a combination of the cross of materiality and the crescent of the soul. This signifies the process of spiritual evolution, whereby the soul transcends the material world. The cross of materiality alludes to the physical plane, and how it limits the consciousness within the bounds of time and space. The crescent of the soul signifies the transcendent aspect, a part of our being that seeks the spiritual path, aspiring to break free from the constraints of material existence.

2. Astrological significance

Astrologically, Saturn is the ruling planet of Capricorn and the traditional ruler of Aquarius. Known as the "Taskmaster" or "Great Malefic," Saturn represents discipline, restriction, responsibility, and long-term perseverance. It symbolizes the process of learning through hardship and the consequential growth derived from the experience. The planet's placement in an individual's natal chart can reveal areas in life where they may face limitations or potential challenges they must navigate to grow spiritually.

3. Esoteric underpinnings: Passage of time and karmic law

Esoterically, Saturn governs the passage of time, the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth, as well as the cycles of cause and effect, known as karmic law. Saturn's association with time reflects its role in facilitating the individual's spiritual evolution through successive incarnations or life experiences.

Karmic law operates through the principle of correspondence, ensuring that all actions and intentions will eventually beget consequences proportionate to their nature. Saturn's influence is present in these cycles, ensuring that the soul's actions and decisions in one life will bring about corresponding consequences in future lives. This principle guides the path of spiritual development and imparts an important lesson: that every action has consequences, and that embracing responsibility and learning from the challenges we face is crucial to fulfilling our spiritual potential.

4. Influence on the Saturnian brotherhood teachings and practices

The teachings and practices of the Saturnian brotherhood reflect the esoteric significance and symbology of Saturn. Initiates and students of the brotherhood rely on the principles of discipline, introspection, and self-mastery to facilitate their spiritual growth. The Saturnian brotherhood emphasizes cultivating individual responsibility, prompting each aspirant to face and overcome the limitations imposed by the material world, ultimately aligning themselves with the principle of karmic law and the cycles of time.

5. Spiritual evolution and individual responsibility

By understanding the symbology, astrological significance, and esoteric underpinnings of Saturn, one can gain insight into how these elements contribute to the mastery of spiritual evolution and the cultivation of individual responsibility in the aspirant's journey of self-realization. Saturn's influence highlights the importance of discipline, self-imposed limitations, and perseverance in the face of challenges, acting as a catalyst for spiritual growth and maturity.

In conclusion, the symbology of Saturn, its astrological influence, and its esoteric connection to the passage of time and karmic law provide powerful insights for understanding the Saturnian brotherhood and the process of spiritual evolution. By aligning oneself with these principles and cultivating individual responsibility, the aspirant is better equipped to achieve self-realization, surpassing the limitations of the material plane and embracing the spiritual wisdom necessary to evolve and grow on a soul level.
