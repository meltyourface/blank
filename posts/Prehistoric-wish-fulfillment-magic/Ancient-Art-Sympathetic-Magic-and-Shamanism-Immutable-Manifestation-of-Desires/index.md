To answer the challenge, we'll delve into the intertwined connections between ancient cave paintings, the animistic belief in sympathetic magic, and the role of shamans, as well as explore how these concepts come together to immutably manifest and fulfill desires for the well-being of an individual or community.

Ancient Cave Paintings:
Ancient cave paintings serve as a significant and powerful medium through which prehistoric people articulated their beliefs, desires, and experiences. These paintings often depicted animals, humans, and scenes of hunting or other daily activities. The artwork is believed to have deep connotations, representing both the external or physical world and the internal or spiritual realm. They often act as a manifestation of early man's belief system, reflecting the interconnectedness between the physical, metaphysical, and spiritual planes.

Animistic Belief of Sympathetic Magic:
Sympathetic magic is a form of animistic belief rooted in the notion that there's a mystical connection or relationship between objects, beings, and natural phenomena. **This belief system relies on two primary principles**: the Law of Similarity (like affects like) and the Law of Contagion (once in contact, objects continue to influence each other, even at a distance). In the context of the prehistoric world, sympathetic magic was employed as a means to exert control over the environment, animals, and each other, in an effort to secure particular outcomes or fulfill desires.

Role of Shamans:
Shamans, often regarded as the spiritual leaders or intermediaries, played a crucial role in the integration of these beliefs. They were believed to possess the ability to communicate with the spiritual realm, using their extensive knowledge of the natural environment and its energies in rituals, divination, and healing. As spiritual mediators, they facilitated a reciprocal exchange between the seen and unseen world, working with cosmic and earth energies, spirits, and ancestors, to maintain balance and collective well-being within the community.

Convergence for Immutable Manifestation of Desires:
Understanding the interplay between ancient cave paintings, sympathetic magic, and shamans reveals how they converge to immutably manifest desires for the benefit of individuals and communities in the prehistoric era. Cave paintings acted as a symbolic representation of the animistic worldview, depicting scenes that conveyed a deep connection between the physical and metaphysical realms. Through the use of sympathetic magic principles as depicted in these paintings, shamans were able to harness the power of the mystical relationships between objects, beings, and phenomena within their environment.

By carrying out specific rituals, the shaman could create a representation of their target, either in the form of a painting or a talisman, applying the Law of Similarity to catalyze the intended outcome. The creative intention behind the artwork would thus play a significant role in manifesting the desired outcome, imbuing the images with a potent energy that radiated throughout the tribe or community's collective consciousness. Through the facilitation of shamans, the innate power of ancient cave art joined forces with the principles of sympathetic magic, thereby amplifying their impacts, and allowing individuals or communities to immutably fulfill their desires.

In summary, the symbolic relationship between ancient cave paintings, the animistic belief in sympathetic magic, and the role of shamans appears intricately intertwined. Through the depiction of their beliefs and desires in cave paintings, prehistoric people relied on the metaphysical connections between objects and phenomena, facilitated by spiritual leaders or shamans. By understanding and harnessing the power of these cave paintings and sympathetic magic principles, shamans were able to immutably manifest and fulfill the desires of their communities.
