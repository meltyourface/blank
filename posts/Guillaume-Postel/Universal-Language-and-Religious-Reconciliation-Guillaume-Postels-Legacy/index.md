In order to delineate the conceptual connection between the Universal Language, Kabbalah, and Postel's prophetic vision of the reconciliation of religious differences, we must first familiarize ourselves with the background of Guillaume Postel and his esoteric pursuits.

Guillaume Postel (1510-1581) was a renowned French linguist, mathematician, philosopher, and expert in various esoteric disciplines such as Kabbalah, prophetics, and angelology. As a prolific scholar, he authored several influential works that dealt with the mentioned areas, which contributed to the shaping of his prophetic vision of religious reconciliation. To grasp the interrelated nature of these ideas, we will examine the key works and notions that embody them.

The notion of the Universal Language, or "Lingua Universalis," emerges as a central theme in Postel's esoteric pursuits. He believed that a single, divine language, based on the principles of harmony and mathematical proportions, had once unified humanity. This idea finds its most prominent expression in his groundbreaking work, "De Foenicibus," which revolved around the revival of the original "Adamic" language. In this work, Postel drew heavily on his knowledge of the Hebrew language, as well as his wider expertise in various Semitic and Oriental languages.

Kabbalah forms an essential aspect of Postel's intellectual and spiritual pursuits. As a mystical Jewish tradition, it focuses on understanding the divine nature and cosmology through intricate reinterpretations of religious texts and the Hebrew alphabet. Postel adopted Kabbalistic theories, especially those of the Zohar, into his own thoughts, merging them with Christian esoterism. He regarded language as the key to unveiling the mysteries of the cosmos. His book "Clavis Absconditorum a Constitutione Mundi" serves as an example of his engagement with Kabbalistic thought, where he attempted to reconcile the Hebrew alphabet with the Greek alphabet and their numerical properties.

Now, let us delve into the crux of Postel's prophetic vision for the reconciliation of religious differences. Driven by his extensive knowledge of various religions, he conceived a universal restoration that would lead to a convergence of religious traditions, anchored in his idea of a common divine language. This theme is prominently expressed in his works "De Orbis Terrae Concordia" and "De Eritici Ad Vitam et Salutem Vocandi Recta Calenda." In these texts, Postel explores the historical trajectory of human unity until the prophesied end times. He posits that the rediscovery of the Universal Language, along with the adoption of a global monarchy and religion, would facilitate religious reconciliation and unite humanity.

Therefore, we can see a clear connection between the Universal Language, Kabbalah, and Postel's prophecy of religious reconciliation. By integrating linguistic expertise, Kabbalistic insights, and his own vision of a unified spiritual tradition, Postel conceived an eschatological framework in which religions would ultimately converge. His key works, including "De Foenicibus," "Clavis Absconditorum a Constitutione Mundi," "De Orbis Terrae Concordia," and "De Eritici Ad Vitam et Salutem Vocandi Recta Calenda," encompass these interrelated themes and serve as an illustration of the conceptual linkages.

In conclusion, Guillaume Postel's linguistic and esoteric pursuits revolve around the notions of the Universal Language, Kabbalah, and the prophetic vision of religious reconciliation. He believed that language was a divinely appointed means to uncover the hidden wisdom of creation, and a mastery of it could help to facilitate the merger of disparate religious traditions. Consequently, his intellectual and spiritual journey led him to pen numerous works that stand as testament to these interconnected ideas, providing a holistic perspective on his unique vision of a harmonious world.
