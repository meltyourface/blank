To unravel the knowledge challenge at hand, it is crucial first to comprehend the core tenets that bridge the gap between the spiritual and physical realms, and how interlacing these tenets fosters the transformation of the initiate into an Illuminated Adept within the context of The Invisible Order of Illuminated Adepts. In order to do that, I shall delve into the historical background, core tenets, the principles and practices, and finally, the process of transformation involving both spiritual and physical aspects. 

Historical Background:
The Invisible Order of Illuminated Adepts is an esoteric and occult order that finds its roots in the rich tradition of Western mystery schools. It is a synthesis of various practices, teachings, and philosophical currents coming from Hermeticism, Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Tantra, and Alchemy. These ancient wisdom traditions aimed at achieving spiritual transformation and self-realization through an experiential and practical path.

Core Tenets:
To bridge the gap between the spiritual and physical realms, the Order follows a set of core tenets that form the bedrock of their teachings. These tenets consist of:

1. The Principle of Correspondence: This principle states that the spiritual and physical realms are not separate entities but, rather, interconnected and interdependent aspects of one holistic reality. It embodies the age-old axiom, "As above, so below; as within, so without."

2. The Principle of Vibration: Everything in the Universe is in constant motion and vibrating at different frequencies. By attuning oneself to specific vibrational frequencies, the initiate can tap into the underlying spiritual forces that govern the material world.

3. The Principle of Polarity: This principle posits that the Universe is comprised of forces in constant opposition – such as light and darkness, spirit and matter – that must be reconciled and harmonized in order to achieve spiritual transformation.

4. The Principle of Transmutation: This tenet emphasizes the practice of inner alchemy. The initiate transmutes base desires, thoughts, and emotions into spiritual gold as part of their growth, aligning the physical and mental aspects with the spiritual realm.

Interlacing and Transformation:
The transformation of an initiate into an Illuminated Adept is a process that involves a harmonious interweaving of these core tenets into their daily lives and practices. This process can be outlined in the following steps:

1. Mental and Emotional Purification: By understanding the Principles of Correspondence, Vibration, and Polarity, the initiate learns to purify their thoughts, emotions, and desires, setting the foundation for transmutation.

2. Alchemical Work: The initiate practices inner alchemy to refine their being and align themselves with the spiritual realm, transcending the limitations imposed by the physical realm and cultivating a deep understanding of the Principle of Transmutation.

3. Divine Harmony: As the initiate's spiritual and physical aspects gradually become holistically aligned, they develop the ability to harmonize and balance polarities, leading to increased powers of perception, intuition, and spiritual insight.

4. Illumination and Realization: This final stage of transformation sees the individual become an Illuminated Adept. Fully aligned with the spiritual realm, the Adept has transcended the limitations of the physical world, realizing their true nature and innate wisdom.

In conclusion, the Invisible Order of Illuminated Adepts fosters the transformation of an initiate into an Illuminated Adept by synthesizing various principles, teachings, and practices from ancient wisdom traditions. The core tenets bridge the spiritual and physical worlds, providing an experiential path to self-realization marked by mental and emotional purification, alchemical work, divine harmony, and ultimately, illumination and realization.
