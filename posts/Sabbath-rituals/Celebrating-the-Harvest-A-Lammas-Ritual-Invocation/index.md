excerpt: Compose a comprehensive and intricate invocation for the Goddess, specifically tailored to be spoken during a Lammas ritual, incorporating traditional symbols, elements, and associations with the first harvest. Utilize precise and evocative language to call upon the Goddess's attributes of fertility, life, and abundance, while integrating specific correspondences such as the use of sacred herbs, grains, and colors into the written invocation.

In the waning glow of summer's sun,
On this day of Lammas, we have come.
To celebrate the sacred harvest, we gather 'neath your grace,
Oh mighty Goddess, manifest, please show your radiant face.

From fertile soils, life springs forth triumphant,
Abundant Mother, Maiden of the verdant earth,
In this circle, your essence we invoke,
Lend us your wisdom and your love, unyielding as an oak.

Hail Demeter, guardian of golden grains,
Hail Freyja, blessed be your fruitful reign,
With votive offerings of corn and bread,
Thanksgiving for life's bounties, by your hand we're blessed.

By the power of ripened wheat, and steadfast barley stem,
Bring forth the energies divine, entwined within your gem.
A sacred dance, circle round, with colors red and gold,
As fragrant herbs of rosemary, mint, and marjoram gently enfold.

Oh generous Goddess, glorious embodiment of life,
Touch our hearts, and nourish us, dispelling pain and strife.
We call upon your spirit, with sacred stones and tools,
And in your name, we weave our craft; enflamed, we burn the Yule.

In unity, we honor you, the bounty of your love,
As below is matched above, and Heaven meets the Earth.
The spiraling abundance of your grace and warmth divine,
We bind our circle's energy, and offer up our shrine.

Rejoice for fields of green transformed to golden hue,
For in this season of Lammas, our hearts are birthed anew.
Goddess of ten thousand names, your presence we enthrall,
By the blessings of the harvest, let abundance now befall.

As the wheel turns onward, and twilight fades to night,
We thank you for your nurturing, your radiance and your might.
Through your wisdom, strength, and love, we've reveled in your dance,
Oh bountiful Goddess, Lammas Queen, our circle now enhance.

With reverence and gratitude, we hail you, Goddess divine,
In perfect trust and perfect love, your blessings intertwine.
So mote it be, and on this Lammas, we rejoice,
In hallowed chorus, we give thanks, with but one single voice.
