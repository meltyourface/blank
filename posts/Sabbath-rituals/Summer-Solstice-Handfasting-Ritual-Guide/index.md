Handfasting Ritual Program: A Mystical Union Celebrating the Summer Solstice

1. Invocation to Elemental Forces and Deities:

Begin by lighting a white candle to represent the divine spirit. Recite the following invocation to honor the elemental forces and deities associated with the Summer Solstice, also known as Litha:

"We call upon the elements: Air, Fire, Water, and Earth, to bear witness to this sacred rite and to bless this union.
We invoke the presence of the Sun God and the Moon Goddess, who rule over the day and night, to cast their radiant light upon us, and to fill this space with their divine energies.
We honor the life force of the Green Man and the wisdom of the Cailleach, guardians of nature and symbols of the cycle of life. May their abundance and renewal grace this handfasting ceremony."

2. Casting the Sacred Circle:

Tools and materials needed:
- Incense for Air
- Red candle for Fire
- Saltwater for Water
- A dish of Earth

Step-by-step guide:

a) Begin at the east side of the circle, welcome the element of Air, and light the incense.

b) Move to the south, welcome the element of Fire, and light a red candle.

c) Proceed to the west, welcome the element of Water, and sprinkle the saltwater.

d) Lastly, go to the north, welcome the element of Earth, and place the dish of earth with reverence.

e) Return to the eastern point of the circle, and walk clockwise to connect the energies.

3. The Spiritual Significance of Handfasting:

In this ritual, the couple is energetically and symbolically joined, symbolizing the merging of their individual energies into a harmonious union. Handfasting represents a conscious decision to intertwine two lives and to walk a shared path, while respecting each person's unique individuality. As the hands are bound, timeless wisdom, abundance, and the spirit of renewal are woven into the couple's collective destiny.

4. Binding the Couple's Hands:

**Choose a cord or ribbon imbued with the colors of the Summer Solstice**: yellow for the sun's light, green for abundance, blue for clear skies, and white for purity.

Knot pattern:
- Begin with a basic knot to symbolize unity.
- Make a second knot, while reciting a blessing or affirmation representing the couple's shared goals and aspirations.
- Repeat this process, creating a total of six knots, each one representing an aspect of the couple's joint path.

Chant the following incantation during the binding:

"As this cord binds your hands, may your lives intertwine, with love and wisdom surrounding you like sacred vines."

5. Incorporating Divination:

Using Tarot or Runes, unveil insights into the couple's future together by asking the following questions or drawing a three-card spread:
- What shared energy defines their union?
- What opportunities are on the horizon?
- What challenges must be overcome together?

6. Feasting and Celebration:

Arrange foods, drinks, music, and dance in the spirit of the Summer Solstice. Highlight traditional items such as:

- Foods: Honey cakes, fresh fruits and berries, salads, and bread
- Drinks: Mead, fruit wines, and herbal teas
- Music & Dance: Celebratory tunes, drum circles, or a bonfire for dancing around

7. Closing the Ritual:

Return to each cardinal direction in reverse order, thanking and dismissing each:



a) North, bid farewell to the Earth and express gratitude.
b) West, bid farewell to Water and express gratitude.
c) South, bid farewell to Fire and extinguish the red candle.
d) East, bid farewell to Air and extinguish the incense.

Lastly, thank the deities invoked and extinguish the white candle. Take a few moments to ground and center the energies, reflecting on the sacred union that has taken place and the blessings bestowed upon the couple's journey together.

End the ritual with a closing affirmation such as:

"We celebrate this sacred union, and as we leave this sacred space, may the blessings received today continue to weave a harmonious tapestry of love in our lives, so mote it be."
