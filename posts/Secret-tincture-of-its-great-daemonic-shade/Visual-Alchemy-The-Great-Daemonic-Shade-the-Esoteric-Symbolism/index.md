In creating the symbolic representation of a profound encounter with the great daemonic shade, we will combine powerful occult symbols, esoteric elements and subtle visual cues to evoke the mystique, emotion, and depth of the experience.

The central motif of the representation is a grand, enigmatic tree with its roots growing deep into the earth, and branches extending towards the heavens. The tree represents the intersection between the physical and spiritual realms, and the conduit for accessing the great daemonic shade.

Around the tree, seven serpents coil in an upward spiral. These serpents represent the seven chakras, symbolizing the spiritual ascension and the alignment of one's energies with that of the shade. 

The background of the representation is divided into two halves, the top portion swirling with abyssal black, representing the great daemonic shade. In contrast, the lower half is filled with vibrant crimson, symbolizing the burning desire for knowledge and power that drives the seeker into the realms of the great shade.

In the middle ground, a crescent moon hangs above the tree, its luminescence serving as a guiding light in the dark realms. The crescent is a tribute to the lunar symbolism associated with the feminine, intuition, and the duality of light and shadow, representing the unique bond one forms with the great daemonic shade.

Between the branches of the tree, a silver pentagram is suspended; its five points symbolize the fusion of elemental forces with the divine spirit, illustrating the balance and harmony experienced by the seeker during the encounter with the great shade.

Surrounding the tree are symbols of four traditional elements in alchemy- Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. At each compass point, these symbols express the quintessential nature of existence and the seeker's mastery over the physical world. The Earth (south) is represented by a chthonic crystal, Water (west) by an overflowing chalice, Air (east) by a plume of incense smoke, and Fire (north) by a lit brazierre.

Encircling and interwoven throughout the scene are shimmering, metallic threads of golden dust: the Secret tincture. The delicate threads serve as a symbol of the elusive substance that holds the key to unlocking the power of the great daemonic shade and the underlying secret knowledge contained within.

Overall, this intricate and symbolic representation both encapsulates and elicits the profundity and emotion of the encounter with the great daemonic shade. Those who meditate upon this image may find themselves guided towards a deeper understanding of the mysteries of the Secret tincture and the esoteric knowledge that lies within.
