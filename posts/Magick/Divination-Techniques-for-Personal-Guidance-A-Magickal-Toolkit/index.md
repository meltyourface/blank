## I. Selection of Suitable Magickal Tools

To tailor the divination technique to the issue at hand and the practitioner's preferences, the following magickal tools are suggested:

1. Tarot cards: A well-chosen deck that resonates with the practitioner, offering visual cues and symbolism to aid in their interpretation.
2. Pendulum: A crystal or metal pendulum, selected for its particular energy and connection to the user.
3. Runes: A set of runes, either traditional or personalized, that holds the power of archetypal symbols and represents the forces that shape reality.
4. Scrying mirror: A black mirror or bowl of water, which serves as a gateway to other dimensions and allows intuitive visions to emerge.

### II. Preparation of Magickal Instruments

1. Tarot cards: Cleanse them with incense, such as sage or sandalwood, while setting the intention of revealing the optimal course of action. Charge them under the light of the full moon.
2. Pendulum: Cleanse by submerging in saltwater or placing on a bed of salt overnight. Charge with clear quartz or selenite, or by leaving it in sunlight or moonlight.
3. Runes: Purify with smoke from a sage or cedar bundle, then further empower them by placing on an altar surrounded by crystals or herbs associated with divination.
4. Scrying mirror: Cleanse it with a mixture of water, salt, and rosemary herb. Charge in the moonlight, surrounded by intuitively chosen crystals.

### III. Casting a Protective Circle and Invoking Beneficial Forces

1. Cast a circle using salt, chalk, or a ritual knife, visualizing a protective energy barrier emerging from the ground.
2. Light candles corresponding to the elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) and place them at the corresponding directions (North, East, South, West).
3. Invoke the guidance of chosen deities, spirit guides, or angels by reciting a personalized invocation or mantra.

### IV. Detailed Divination Procedure

1. Tarot cards: Focus on the question, shuffle the deck, and choose three cards: The first represents the current situation, the second represents possible paths, and the third represents the optimal course of action.
2. Pendulum: Ask specific yes or no questions, while holding the pendulum above a diagram representing possible outcomes. Observe the pendulum's movement for answers.
3. Runes: Meditate on the question, draw a rune from a pouch or spread, and interpret it based on traditional meanings, personal insight, and its relation to the situation.
4. Scrying mirror: Gaze into the mirror, allowing the conscious mind to relax. Look for images, symbols, or messages that present themselves with clarity and relevance.

### V. Integration of Insights

1. Record the results of the divination session in a journal, noting any symbols, messages, or patterns.
2. Reflect on the interpretations by considering how they align with the current situation, and what steps may be required to achieve the desired outcome.
3. Develop an actionable plan based on the insights, while remaining flexible and open to change as new information or divine guidance emerges during the journey.
4. Reassess the situation at periodic intervals, adjusting the plan as necessary and utilizing the divination technique for continuous guidance and direction.
