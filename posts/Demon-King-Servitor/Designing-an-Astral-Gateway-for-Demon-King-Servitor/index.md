Designing a detailed astral sigil or gateway infused with specific occult symbols and dark energies for the Demon King Servitor involves several key components. As an AI, I cannot provide visual illustrations, but I can describe these components and outline a design based on your guidelines.

1. Intricate Patterns
The sigil or gateway should incorporate patterns that consist of overlapping shapes, such as spirals, hexagrams, and serpent-like coils, representing the tangled web of the Demon King Servitor's influence. These patterns should gradually spiral inwards, converging towards a central focal point - the source of the demon's power.

2. Forbidden Languages, Runes and Sacred Geometry
To resonate with the Demon King Servitor's frequencies, use ancient alphabets like Enochian or Theban, or create your own cryptic runic language with demonic syllables. Incorporate these within the sigil's patterns and intersect them with key geometric elements like the Vesica Piscis (interlinked circles) or Metatron's Cube (a 3D geometric figure made from interconnected lines and points) to strengthen its potency.

3. Protective Wards and Barriers
Infuse the sigil or gateway with protective symbols, such as the Eye of Horus, pentagrams, or the Hamsa, which can be integrated into the patterns as layers. These wards will serve as a safeguard against potential harm and maintain control over the interaction with the Demon King Servitor.

4. Construction Process
The process of constructing the sigil or gateway should follow these steps:

a. Select a quiet, dimly lit space for the ritual, free from distractions and interruptions.
b. Gather the necessary materials including parchment or canvas, a ceremonial writing/etching tool, ink mixed with ash or blood, and any required ritualistic items such as incense, candles, and offerings.
c. Cleanse the space using sacred herbs like sage or palo santo, and cast a sacred circle or invoke a protective barrier.
d. Meditate to focus your intention and visualize the Demon King Servitor's energy.
e. Begin drawing the intricate patterns, as previously described, focusing on the central point as the main source of power.
f. Incorporate the interwoven languages, runes, and sacred geometry elements along the sigil's patterns.
g. Integrate the protective wards and barriers within the design.
h. When the sigil or gateway is complete, perform an invocation ritual to activate its energy before attempting any communication.

5. Utilizing the Sigil or Gateway
Beginners should approach interactions cautiously, focusing on meditation and basic channeling techniques to establish a connection. Intermediate practitioners can perform rituals using offerings and chants to draw forth more significant manifestations and guidance. Advanced users can attempt full invocation, allowing the Demon King Servitor to communicate through them or relying on astral projection to enter the demon's realm completely.

Keep in mind that working with demonic entities carries inherent risks, and caution should always be exercised. Regularly cleanse and perform protective rituals to maintain control and avoid any unintended consequences.
