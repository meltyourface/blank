The Key of Solomon, or Clavicula Salomonis, is a highly influential grimoire attributed to the renowned King Solomon from the Hebrew tradition. However, the work itself likely originates from the Renaissance period, rather than antiquity. The grimoire consists of two primary books detailing magical procedures, the summoning of spirits, and the creation of various amulets and talismans. Focusing on Renaissance esotericism and strange spirits inhabiting photos, this textual analysis aims to determine its likely author, explore connections to mysterious occurrences, phenomena, and examine potential links to key figures in Renaissance esotericism.

The language used within the manuscript supports its roots in Renaissance Europe. The Key of Solomon contains numerous Latin, Greek, and Hebrew phrases, rendering it a composite work representative of the diverse linguistic influences present within the European Renaissance. Furthermore, the text shows distinct similarities to other grimoires of the same era, such as the Lesser Key of Solomon (Lemegeton), suggesting the influence of a shared intellectual milieu during that time.

Observing specific symbols and references within the text, the Key of Solomon displays an extensive knowledge of occult symbols, both traditional and innovative. Distinct markings associated with planetary symbols, geometric shapes, and pentacles pervade the work, indicating a strong connection to the broader Renaissance Neoplatonic and Hermetic currents. Additionally, the texts discuss particular spirits within the context of the celestial hierarchy, revealing an intricate understanding of the spirit world.

Strange spirits inhabiting photos are not directly mentioned in the Key of Solomon; however, the theme of capturing spirits' power and essence is present. This concept aligns with the idea that mysterious forces or spirits may become trapped within the physical medium of Renaissance art. The creation of sigils, amulets, and talismans, evocation procedures, and the depiction of magical circles all imply an attempt to grasp and encapsulate otherworldly influences.

The social and historical context of the work suggests potential connections to key figures of Renaissance esotericism. Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Marsilio Ficino, and Pico della Mirandola, three intellectual luminaries in the age of the Renaissance, might have been privy to the contents of the Key of Solomon. Given their prominent positions within the esoteric and occult circles, any one of them or their close acquaintances could have potentially authored the work. Still, no concrete evidence directly links these figures to the text's creation.

When examining the overall style and content of the Key of Solomon, many aspects of the grimoire reflect the period's esoteric beliefs: the complex interactions between celestial angels and demons, the incorporation of astrological and alchemical knowledge, and the syncretism of classical and medieval traditions. Mysterious occurrences such as evoking spirits, prophecy, and control over natural forces feature prominently in the text, again highlighting its firm foundation in Renaissance esotericism.

In conclusion, while the exact authorship of the Key of Solomon remains uncertain, the textual analysis indicates a deep connection to the esoteric milieu of Renaissance Europe. The text's symbolism, language, and the evocation of the spirit world all support its place within the broader tradition of Renaissance occultism. Although no concrete connections to prominent figures of the movement can be conclusively established, it is abundantly evident that the text was the product of the vibrant and intricately woven tapestry of Renaissance esoteric thought.
