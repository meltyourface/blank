In analyzing various translations and interpretations of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat, one cannot ignore the pivotal role Edward FitzGerald played in introducing this classical Persian poetry to the Western world. FitzGerald’s multiple editions contributed significantly to the global understanding and appreciation of Khayyam's works. Nevertheless, inconsistencies, deviations, and discrepancies have emerged due to differing personal biases and historical contexts.

FitzGerald's five editions of the Rubaiyat varied in the number of quatrains and their arrangement. The first edition (1859) had 75 quatrains, while the second (1868) had 110, the third (1872) and fourth (1879) both had 101, and the fifth (1889) had 107. The difference in the number of quatrains implies a selective process by FitzGerald, which may have resulted in the exclusion or inclusion of certain quatrains, generating inconsistencies in the interpretations across editions.

In examining the symbolic and metaphorical representations in the quatrains, FitzGerald often took creative liberties in his translations. While aiming to make Khayyam's poetry more appealing to the Victorian audience, he introduced personal biases and thus strayed from the original intentions of the poetry.

For example, in the original Persian quatrain, the term "خرگوش" (khargosh) meaning "hare" is used, which represents an animal with symbolic importance in Persian culture. However, FitzGerald translated this as "Lion," an animal more familiar and symbolically significant to Western audiences. This change disrupted the authenticity of Khayyam's work and shifted the focus towards FitzGerald's adaptation rather than the original poetry.

In another instance, the concept of the "Tavern," which recurs in Khayyam's verses, holds different associations in Persian and Victorian cultures. In Persian tradition, the tavern represents a place of mystical reunion with the divine and overcoming earthly attachments. In FitzGerald’s version, however, it assumes a hedonistic connotation related to earthly pleasures and indulgence, reflecting the translator's personal interpretation and the prevailing views of his era.

These inconsistencies not only impact the perception of the Rubaiyat’s rich intricacies and hidden meanings but also contribute to a varied understanding of the original intentions of Omar Khayyam. Consequently, the translations that perpetuate personal biases or cater to the tastes of specific time periods may inadvertently undermine the universal connection to the original symbolism and themes.

One potential explanation for the unexpected inconsistencies stems from the fact that FitzGerald tried to create a coherent narrative within the Rubaiyat. In doing so, he may have expanded upon or altered the original to suit his vision, generating discrepancies between his translation and the authentic meaning or form intended by Khayyam. Furthermore, translating from Persian to English is inherently complex, as the languages are vastly different, and capturing the exact essence of particular words or phrases is no easy feat.

In conclusion, while FitzGerald's editions of the Rubaiyat brought Omar Khayyam's work to the attention of the Western audience, deviations and discrepancies have emerged over time due to differing personal biases and the intricacies involved in translating between languages. These inconsistencies affect the overall understanding and appreciation of this classical Persian poetry masterpiece. Thus, one must approach each translation with caution and consideration for both the cultural complexities and the historical contexts influencing the translator's choices.
