I selected Quatrain XII from Edward FitzGerald's translation of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat, as there is a noticeable shift in meaning and tone between the original Persian verse and the translated version.

Original Persian verse:

به یاد کسی هر غم خوری کنم
ز عشق بلا وی خبری کنم
چون می‌دهد او می برون خورشید
از خوردن می برون خورشید کی خوردم

Edward FitzGerald's translation:

A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread—and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness—
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!

In the original Persian verse, Omar Khayyam expresses his desire to drink and remember a loved one, despite the troubles caused by love. The emphasis lies on the importance of wine and celebration even under the harsh glare of the sun, as conveyed metaphorically. The tone of the original verse is a mixture of melancholy and defiance, as the poet chooses to cherish memories and love, even amid hardships.

In comparison, FitzGerald's translation shifts the focus of the quatrain by emphasizing the pleasures of life, such as enjoying verses, wine, and companionship. The translation carries a lighter, more joyful tone, suggesting contentment with life's simple blessings. It deviates from the original by celebrating the wilderness, contrasting it with the paradise invoked in the Persian text.

In terms of literary devices, the Persian verse employs metaphor, comparing the act of drinking wine to facing direct sunlight—a daring act that showcases the poet's defiance. This concept is lost in the translation, where the imagery is more straightforward, invoking the idyllic scene of a lover, verses, bread, and wine.

The cultural and historical context behind the original text reveals Omar Khayyam's complex relationship with wine and love, reflecting the norms and values of medieval Persian society. Wine serves as a symbol of defiance against oppressive forces and the rigidity of religious rules. Conversely, FitzGerald's translation reflects the Victorian ethos and aesthetic sensibilities, turning the quatrain into a romanticized celebration of simpler times and untamed nature.

In conclusion, the transformations observed within this quatrain illustrate the impact of translating a work from one language and cultural context into another. FitzGerald's translation of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat offers a distinct flavor compared to the original, reflecting different cultural values and the interpreter's personal perspectives. This analysis also highlights the importance of recognizing these differences when engaging in literary analysis of translated works.
