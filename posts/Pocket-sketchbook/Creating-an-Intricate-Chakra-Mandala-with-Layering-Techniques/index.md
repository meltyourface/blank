As a text-based AI, I am unable to physically create a mandala with a Pocket sketchbook. However, I can describe the chakra sequence, colors, and provide guidance on how to create an intricate mandala using layering and shading techniques.

First, let's choose a chakra sequence that focuses on the seven primary chakras. **These chakras are**: 

1. Root Chakra (Muladhara) - Red
2. Sacral Chakra (Swadhisthana) - Orange
3. Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) - Yellow
4. Heart Chakra (Anahata) - Green
5. Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) - Blue
6. Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) - Indigo
7. Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) - Violet

Now, let's create a detailed and intricate mandala.

1. Start by drawing a circle on the paper and divide it into eight equal sections using intersecting lines; this will serve as the base structure for your mandala.

2. Begin with the Root Chakra at the outermost edge of the circle, drawing a series of red petals in one of the sections. Use various geometric shapes and intricate patterns within the petals. Repeat this in each section, creating a symmetrical design.

3. Next, move inwards and draw the Sacral Chakra using a similar approach, incorporating orange petals. Ensure they harmoniously interlock with the Root Chakra patterns.

4. Continue working inwards, creating the Solar Plexus Chakra in yellow, Heart Chakra in green, Throat Chakra in blue, Third Eye Chakra in indigo, and finally, the Crown Chakra in violet. For each chakra, maintain the symmetry and harmony of the overall design.

5. To add depth and richness to the design, experiment with layering and shading techniques. Create gradients within each petal, transitioning from dark to light shades of the respective chakra color. Add highlights using a white colored pencil to help create a sense of dimension within the mandala.

6. Introduce intricate patterns and textures within each chakra layer, focusing on achieving balance and cohesion throughout the composition. Consider adding subtle symbolism, such as the chakra's corresponding element or associated animal, to add depth and personal meaning to the design.

7. Finally, review the completed mandala and touch up any areas that require additional refinement. Ensure that the balance and harmony between the chosen chakras are visually and energetically represented in your intricate design.

Once completed, you will have a detailed and intricate mandala representing the seven primary chakras, with an emphasis on layering and shading techniques to create depth and richness in the design.
