To provide a comprehensive response to this knowledge challenge, we shall break it down into four key sections: 

1. Analyzing the multidimensional nature of the daimonic medieval Witches' Sabbath.
2. Examining the topological aspects, including spatial-temporal arrangements, entity transmutations, and symbolic configurations.
3. Identifying the symbolic role of these topological features in fostering transformative spiritual experiences.
4. Illustrating their underlying connections with broader esoteric traditions and practices.

### I. **Analyzing the multidimensional nature of the daimonic medieval Witches' Sabbath**:

The Witches' Sabbath is a term referring to the gathering of witches, often accompanied by daimonic entities, during the medieval period in Europe. These sabbaths were believed to be a space for the collective enactment of rituals, mysteries, and practices that formed part of the witchcraft tradition. The multidimensional nature of the daimonic medieval Witches' Sabbath lies in its ability to create an intermediate space between the physical and spiritual worlds, a space where transformations and manifestations were possible.

### II. **Examining the topological aspects**:

1. **Spatial-temporal arrangements**:

During a Witches' Sabbath, both time and space were believed to distort or collapse in a way that facilitated unique experiences. It was alleged that witches could travel to remote locations instantaneously, sometimes by riding nocturnal animals or using magical implements such as broomsticks. Sabbaths often occurred in secret, remote places like woods or lonely hills. The boundaries between the earthly and otherworldly were also blurred, revealing a topological complexity that defied conventional normsâ€”time stood still or moved differently, and space contorted, allowing spirits and witches to traverse vast distances in brief moments.

2. **Entity transmutations**:

Transmutations and shape-shifting played a significant role in the Witches' Sabbath. Witches and daimonic entities were said to possess the ability to assume different forms, such as animals or other humans. This transmutation allowed them to evade detection, interact with each other in new ways, and undergo various rituals and initiations that contributed to the transformative nature of the ceremony. It exemplifies the constantly changing and unpredictable nature of the occult and magical world.

3. **Symbolic configurations**:

Symbolic configurations were a central part of the Witches' Sabbath, employing various symbols, colors, and images that held both spiritual and cultural significance. Artifacts, offerings, costumes, and ritual instruments used in the sabbath possessed symbolic meanings that corresponded to the intentions and energies brought forth during the ritual. They often drew upon broader themes from esoteric practices, such as alchemical symbols, astrological signs, and numerology, to imbue the event with layers of interconnected meaning.

### III. **Identifying the symbolic role of these topological features in fostering transformative spiritual experiences**:

The topological features served as catalysts for personal and communal transformation during the Witches' Sabbath. The spatial-temporal arrangements enabled the participants to unite their energies and access realms beyond the mundane, thereby facilitating growth and spiritual development. Entity transmutations allowed for the exploration and embodiment of various archetypes, helping the witch or human participant to gain insights and understanding of their own psyche and the hidden aspects of reality. Symbolic configurations provided a language through which these transformations could be consciously interpreted and integrated into the individual's spiritual practice.

### IV. **Illustrating their underlying connections with broader esoteric traditions and practices**:

Although the Witches' Sabbath may have been unique to its historical and cultural context, the topological features described above exhibit connections with broader esoteric traditions and practices. For instance, the spatial-temporal distortions can be seen in the ancient practices of shamanism, where shamans undertook spiritual journeys to otherworldly realms during trance states. Entity transmutations mirror certain aspects of alchemy, particularly the focus on inner transformation and metamorphosis as essential to personal growth and development. Symbolic configurations are ubiquitous across esoteric traditions, such as Tarot, astrology, and Kabbalah, where symbols are crucial for understanding and navigating the spiritual landscape.

In conclusion, the multidimensional nature of the daimonic medieval Witches' Sabbath is encapsulated by its topological aspects, such as spatial-temporal arrangements, entity transmutations, and symbolic configurations. These features functioned not only as tools for self-transformation but also as points of connection with broader esoteric practices, emphasizing the continuity and interconnectedness of the occult and magical world across history and cultures.
