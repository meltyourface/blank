  Compose a series of four intricate invocations, each tailored to invoke the distinct energies associated with the topological features and practices of the daimonic medieval Witches' Sabbath at each of the cardinal directions (North, East, South, and West).

Invocation of the North – The Realm of Shadows and Unseen Forces

Oh mighty spirits of the North, guardians of the realm of shadows and unseen forces,
I call upon your ancient powers to join our sacred circle.
With the sacred stone of Baphomet, the animating symbol of our Witch's Sabbath,
I summon your presence in this hallowed gathering.

As the sacred cauldron bubbles and the bones of old are crushed into dust,
So shall your deep roots and powerful secrets be released unto us.
By the Great Horned Owl, the bat's echolocation, and the cunning fox,
we move among shadows and gather knowledge hidden in the dark.

I mark the sacred rune Thurisaz upon the ground, as the black flame of initiation burns,
Mighty spirits of the North, hear my invocation, lend us your power and protection,
Stir through the darkness, and stand by our side, as we perform our rites and incantations.

Invocation of the East – The Winds of Change and Transition

Oh great spirits of the East, masters of the winds of change and transition,
I call upon your transformative essence to guide us through these arcane rites.
With the Wand of Hemlock, the instrument of summoning and control,
I welcome your wisdom and influence during this mystical gathering.

As the smoke rises from the Witch's pyre and the wind carries whispers of secrets,
So shall your breath of change grace our workings with your potent presence.
By the guidance of the raven's eye, the serpent's silent slither, and the swift flight of the falcon,
may your winds usher in a new dawn of understanding and mastery.

I mark the sacred rune Ansuz upon the ground, as the winds fan the black flame of initiation,
Great spirits of the East, grant us your wisdom, and assist us in transcending our limitations,
Carry our intentions far and wide, as we delve deeper into the mysteries of the ancient arts.

Invocation of the South – The Fires of Passion and Will

Oh powerful spirits of the South, holders of the fires of passion and will,
I call upon your fierce and unyielding flames to strengthen our resolve.
With the Sword of Obsidian, the razor-sharp blade of piercing truth,
I invite your flaming breath to ignite our innermost desires.

As the torches burn hot and the fire dances with wild abandon,
May your inferno rage within us, keeping our hearts ablaze with purpose and dedication.
By the unyielding strength of the untamed lion, the salamander's walk through the flames, and the rage of the boar,
illume our path and stoke the embers of our deepest passions.

I mark the sacred rune Kenaz upon the ground, as the black flame of initiation blazes brightly,
Mighty spirits of the South, empower our hearts, grant us courage and unstoppable determination,
Fuel the fires within, and let us fully embrace the transformative force of our desires.

Invocation of the West – The Waters of Intuition and Emotion

Oh wise spirits of the West, preservers of the waters of intuition and emotion,
I call upon your fluid energies to deepen our emotional and psychic connections.
With the Chalice of Crescent Moon Silver, the vessel of intuition and mystery,
I invoke your presence in our sacred gathering to enhance our sensitivities.

As the tides ebb and flow under the moon's gaze, may we too connect with life's eternal cycles,
Just as the rivers meet the seas, merge our consciousness with the infinite well of inner wisdom.
By the mystical insight of the toad, the dolphin's song, and the grace of the swan,
quicken our understanding and attune us to the subtle currents within and around us.

I mark the sacred rune Laguz upon the ground, as the black flame of initiation is quenched,
Oh wise spirits of the West, help us to flow and adapt, to feel and understand the depths of our souls,
Bless us with your watery essence, as we navigate the rivers of emotion and intuitive knowing.
