excerpt: Examine the intersections of various occult orders throughout history, including the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis, in relation to the most notable grimoires, such as the Clavicula Salomonis and the Lesser Key of Solomon. Drawing upon the symbology, practices, and overarching themes, devise an original ritual that incorporates elements from at least two distinct grimoires, detailing how the chosen aspects from each work both harmoniously and discordantly within the context of the specific order.

In order to answer this knowledge challenge, let us begin with a brief analysis of the occult orders and grimoires mentioned before delving into the creation of an original ritual.

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was established in the late 19th century and is often considered one of the most influential occult societies in the Western world. Its teachings and practices have their roots in several different traditions, including Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Alchemy, Astrology, and Theurgy (the practice of ritual magic). The Golden Dawn's rituals predominantly sought to attain spiritual purity and wisdom.

The Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) is another significant occult society, formulated in the early 20th century, which gained prominence particularly under the leadership of Aleister Crowley. It incorporates aspects of Freemasonry, Thelema, and ritual magic with the ultimate goal being the attainment of self-knowledge and spiritual freedom (concept of True Will). The OTO's practices are often more focused on harnessing energies and personal transformation.

Regarding the grimoires, the Clavicula Salomonis, or The Key of Solomon, is a foundational grimoire thought to date back to the Renaissance period. It comprises several conjurations, invocations, and rituals utilized to summon and control spirits and demons. The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as Ars Goetia, is an anonymously authored grimoire which contains descriptions, sigils, and conjurations of the seventy-two demons that King Solomon believed to have control over.

To devise an original ritual that incorporates elements from at least two distinct grimoires, we shall focus on the Clavicula Salomonis and the Lesser Key of Solomon. We shall examine the intersection of these grimoires with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis, as both orders draw on these works for different purposes.

**Title**: Ritual of the Ascending Will

**Objective**: To attain self-knowledge, elevate one's spiritual and mental state, and direct one's willpower towards personal transformation.

**Components**:
1. Circle of Invocation: Following the tradition of the Clavicula Salomonis, draw or inscribe a circle on the ground or floor, with appropriate protective sigils and symbols from both the Golden Dawn and OTO systems, such as the Hexagram and Unicursal Hexagram.
2. Preliminary Invocation: Standing within the circle, perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (from the Golden Dawn system) to purify the space and assert one's dominion over the elements.
3. Invocation of the Higher Self: Borrowing from the OTO Thelemic practices, recite Aleister Crowley's "Liber Samekh," invoking one's Holy Guardian Angel or Higher Self.
4. Conjuration of the 72 Spirits: Choose one spirit from the Lesser Key of Solomon that aligns with the desired purpose or outcome of the ritual. Perform the corresponding conjuration while wearing the appropriate ritual garb, holding the spirit's sigil, and utilizing a wand or sword as mandated by the Clavicula Salomonis.
5. Communication: Once the spirit is conjured, engage in focused communication with the entity, directing it to aid in the attainment of self-knowledge, spiritual elevation, and personal transformation.
6. License to Depart: Thank the spirit for its assistance and give the License to Depart as instructed in the Clavicula Salomonis.
7. Closing: Perform a second Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to cleanse the space, close the gates, and restore balance.

In summary, the Ritual of the Ascending Will combines elements from the Clavicula Salomonis and the Lesser Key of Solomon, integrating practices from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis. The harmony stems from the shared purposes of self-knowledge and transformation across the orders, while the discordance arises from the disparity in their rituals - the Golden Dawn emphasizes purification and wisdom, whereas the OTO accentuates individualism and dynamic energies. The ritual aims to navigate these differences by incorporating both purifying and empowering themes to facilitate growth and progress on the initiates' path.
