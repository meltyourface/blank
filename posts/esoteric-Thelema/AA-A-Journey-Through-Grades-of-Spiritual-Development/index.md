The A.'.A.'. (Astrum Argentum or Silver Star) is an occult organization and spiritual order dedicated to the study, practice, and promulgation of the Law of Thelema. It offers a structured system of advancement through grades, by which initiates progress through various levels of spiritual development. The A.'.A.'. system comprises of 11 primary grades, mirrored after the Qabalistic Tree of Life, and each corresponding to a sephira on the tree. Here, we will delve into a multifaceted analysis of these grades and discover their roles, progressions, and associated rituals.

1. Neophyte (0=0; Malkuth): This grade forms the foundation and the initial point of contact with the A.'.A.'. tradition. Here, the aspirant is introduced to basic esoteric Thelema practices, such as ritual work, meditation, and study of foundational texts. Their role at this stage is to embrace the Law of Thelema and cultivate self-discipline.

2. Probationer (1=10; Yesod): Probationers begin a yearlong trial period and are assigned a personal supervisor. They must maintain a detailed record of their magical work in a 'magical diary.' This stage involves a study of important Thelemic texts, like the Holy Books of Thelema, and initiates develop basic proficiency in practices like the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.

3. Neophyte (2=9; Hod): The Neophyte undergoes tests and develops a relationship with their Holy Guardian Angel (HGA). They learn the rituals and techniques pertinent to their spiritual progress and must master the technique of "rising on the planes," a form of astral projection.

4. Zelator (3=8; Netzach): In this grade, the initiate develops a proficiency in asana, pranayama, and dharana, and must demonstrate knowledge of the Qabalah. The initiate must experience and record a specific astral vision, shaped by their current psychological and spiritual status.

5. Practicus (4=7; Chesed): The Practicus focuses on working with the intellect and using analytical reasoning to understand one's magical practice. They must become proficient in philosophical practices and demonstrate a deep understanding of the elements and principles of occultism.

6. Philosophus (3=6; Geburah): This stage marks the culmination of the initiate's work in the outer order of the A.'.A.'. and a shift towards inner mystical practices. The Philosophus should develop proficiency in asanas, mudras, and yogic meditations, and must demonstrate a profound understanding of diverse Thelemic practices.

7. Adeptus Minor (5=6; Tiphereth): The Adeptus Minor has consciously and consistently established contact with their HGA. This grade focuses on the Great Work, the magical pursuit of higher states of being and enlightenment. The Adeptus Minor enters much deeper mystical practices and the guidance of his/her HGA, whose knowledge, wisdom, and power are instrumental for future progress.

8. Adeptus Major (6=5; Geburah): The Adeptus Major must attain proficiency in advanced forms of invocation, evocation, and divination. The goal is to achieve a state of balance and integration, symbolized by the formula INRI on the Rosy Cross.

9. Adeptus Exemptus (7=4; Chesed): The adept reaches a point of spiritual consciousness where they can guide other aspiring students on their path. The teachings of the A.'.A.'. become incorporated into their own unique understanding, which they share with others.

10. Babe of the Abyss (Ain): The Babe of the Abyss is a transitional phase, characterized by the annihilation of the ego and the integration into of the Initiate's will with the universal will.

11. Magister Templi (8=3; Binah) & Magus (9=2; Chokmah): The roles of Magister Templi and Magus are of the innermost order, known as the Third Order. Magister Templi represents mastery over the mystical aspects of Thelema, while the Magus embodies the active magical power and authority of the Great White Brotherhood.

12. Ipsissimus (10=1; Kether): In this grade, the adept transcends all duality and becomes one with the Divine, effectively completing the path of spiritual progress.

These grades are interconnected, and yet subtly different, marking different milestones in spiritual development. The study and practice of esoteric Thelema within the A.'.A.'. system is progressive and cumulative, with each grade building upon the foundation laid by the previous grade. The distinctions between these grades serve to emphasize the importance of various stages in spiritual development and ensure that the initiate is guided and supported as they progress along the path of Thelema.
