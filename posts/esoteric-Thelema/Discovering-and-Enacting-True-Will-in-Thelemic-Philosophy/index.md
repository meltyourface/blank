## The Nature of True Will in Thelema

1. Introduction to True Will

Within the philosophy of Thelema, one of the central tenets is the concept of the True Will. Founded by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, Thelema seeks to harmonize our individual wills with the overall cosmic purpose. The True Will, or 'Thelema' in Greek, is considered the deepest and most authentic expression of a person's innermost desires and purpose. To discover and enact one's True Will is to be fully aligned with the universe, leading to spiritual liberation, fulfillment, and divine self-realization.

2. The Importance of True Will in Thelema

In Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law), the foundational text of Thelema, it is written, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This statement highlights the critical importance of pursuing and enacting one's True Will as the primary guiding principle in life. Thelema maintains that by following one's True Will, one can not only achieve personal growth and satisfaction but also contribute positively to the harmony of the universe.

Another key Thelemic principle is "Love is the law, love under will." This phrase emphasizes the importance of love in the context of True Will. In Thelema, the concept of love is not merely an emotion but a binding force that connects every element within the universe. Therefore, love, as understood in Thelema, paves the way for the realization and execution of one's True Will.

3. Discovering the True Will

The True Will lies deep within the self, often obscured by social conditioning, distractions, and false desires. To uncover and understand one's True Will, a student of Thelema undergoes a rigorous process of self-exploration, meditation, and spiritual practice.

A vital aspect of this journey is the practice of 'magick,' a term coined by Crowley to distinguish his spiritual teachings from conventional stage magic. Thelemic magick employs various esoteric methodologies, including rituals, invocations, and the use of symbols, to uncover and master one's True Will. The initiate also studies the Qabalah, a form of Jewish mysticism, and other related systems of knowledge to gain insights into the nature of reality, consciousness, and the self.

Another essential aspect of discovering the True Will is the rejection of false will â€“ desires, beliefs, and actions influenced by external pressures and expectations. This process demands confronting and detaching oneself from the illusory forces that hinder one's growth and truth-seeking.

4. Enacting the True Will

Once a student of Thelema has discovered their True Will, they must embrace it as their guiding principle and work to manifest it in their daily life. This involves making choices and engaging in practices that are in alignment with one's True Will. It is believed that enacting the True Will leads to spiritual liberation, self-mastery, and a harmonious life that contributes positively to the greater good.

In conclusion, the concept of True Will lies at the heart of the esoteric Thelemic tradition. It stands as a symbol of individual and cosmic purpose and serves as a guiding principle for self-realization and spiritual evolution. By discovering, embracing, and enacting their True Will, students of Thelema strive to achieve a state of harmony and fulfillment that resonates within themselves and the universe.
