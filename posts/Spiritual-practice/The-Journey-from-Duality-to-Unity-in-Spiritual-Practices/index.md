To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the concepts of duality, unity, and transformation within the spiritual paradigm. We will delve into each concept separately, examine their interdependence, explore their relevance across global traditions and, lastly, investigate their impact on a practitioner's journey to personal growth and self-realization.

Duality is a concept that denotes the existence of opposites or complementary pairs, typically symbolizing the balance or conflict between opposing forces, such as good versus evil, light versus dark, or male versus female. Duality is prevalent across spiritual practices, with examples including Yin and Yang in Taoism, Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter) in Samkhya philosophy, and Ahura Mazda (the Creator) and Angra Mainyu (the destructive spirit) in Zoroastrianism.

Unity, on the other hand, signifies the oneness or wholeness of existence, transcending dualistic thinking to recognize the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. This can be viewed as the ultimate goal in spiritual practice, wherein a practitioner seeks to realize the true nature of reality as non-dual and all-encompassing. Examples of unity can be found in Advaita Vedanta's Brahman-Atman, as well as in the concepts of Nirvana in Buddhism and the Christian idea of oneness with God.

Transformation refers to the process by which an individual undergoes significant inner changes, culminating in a new state of consciousness, perception, or spiritual understanding. At its core, transformation encompasses the shedding of one's ego-based identity, followed by the emergence of a higher level of awareness. This process may include disintegration of limiting beliefs, attainment of wisdom through life experiences, and integration of ethical or moral principles.

Now that we have a basic understanding of duality, unity, and transformation, it is crucial to assess their interconnectedness across diverse traditions. In spiritual practice, duality often serves as a stepping stone to understanding the relationship between opposing forces and recognizing their inherent balance. This balance is critical for maintaining harmony within the individual and the universe. Achieving a deeper understanding of duality creates a foundation for the practitioner to transcend dualistic thinking and strive for unity.

Unity, as a spiritual aim, represents the culmination of the practitioner's journey. By integrating aspects of duality into a coherent whole, an individual gains a greater appreciation for the interconnectedness of existence and moves closer to self-realization. Spiritual traditions worldwide place immense importance on this concept; for example, Hinduism's Atman-Brahman unification, or the Islamic idea of Tawhid, which emphasizes the oneness of God and all of creation.

Transformation plays a pivotal role in the journey from duality to unity; as a practitioner works towards becoming self-realized, they must undergo profound inner change. This process may involve personal development through introspection, pursuing spiritual disciplines, or engaging in acts of kindness and compassion. Spiritual transformation allows the practitioner to shed limiting beliefs, relinquish attachment to dualistic thinking, and ultimately, experience the state of unity.

In conclusion, duality, unity, and transformation are highly interconnected concepts that form the foundation of many spiritual practices worldwide. Duality provides a starting point in recognizing the balance between opposing forces, while unity signifies the ultimate oneness transcending dualistic thinking. Transformation serves as the path to achieving unity, wherein the practitioner undergoes profound personal growth and spiritual development. Collectively, these concepts help guide the individual on their journey towards self-realization, allowing them not only to comprehend the interconnected nature of existence but also to become a more evolved, compassionate, and self-aware human being.
