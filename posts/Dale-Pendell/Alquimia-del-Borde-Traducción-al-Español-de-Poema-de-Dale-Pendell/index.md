I have chosen Dale Pendell's poem "Edge Alchemy," which is a perfect example of his intricate exploration of mysticism and botanical references. I will translate this poem into Spanish, carefully preserving the nuances, essence, and symbolism of the original work.

**Original Poem**: "Edge Alchemy"

Along the rough edges
of the garden of the mind
where species mix
and breed:
Turbulent vectors of thought,
wild patterns of the sacred.

The edges:
Where the sun and shadow touch,
potent germinations,
tangled and vibrant,
growing in secret.

Here
the blackbird sings
a shadow song,
its voice dissolving
into whispers of the wind.

Here
the squirrel waits,
in motionless dreams,
for angels of growth
to reveal the heart of the vine.

It is the wind
that rolls the soul,
teaching
in the space between breaths:
An edge alchemy,
A dance at the boundary.

Poema en español: "Alquimia del Borde"

A lo largo de los bordes ásperos
del jardín de la mente
donde se mezclan las especies
y se reproducen:
Turbulentos vectores del pensamiento,
patrones salvajes de lo sagrado.

Los bordes:
Donde el sol y la sombra se tocan,
poderosas germinaciones,
enredadas y vibrantes,
creciendo en secreto.

Aquí
el mirlo canta
un cántico sombrío,
su voz disolviéndose
en susurros del viento.

Aquí
la ardilla espera,
en sueños inmóviles,
a los ángeles del crecimiento
que revelen el corazón de la vid.

Es el viento
que rueda el alma,
enseñando
en el espacio entre suspiros:
Una alquimia de bordes,
Un baile en el límite.
