Commencing the Sabbatic Ritual of Severance:

This intricate Sabbatic ritual aims to meticulously sever detrimental energetic cords and malevolent attachments with individuals. Throughout this process, we involve specific occult symbols, carefully selected herbs of wormwood and mugwort, and an enigmatic incantation in ancient Sumerian as the core of our ritual.

Preparation:

1. Find a secluded and quiet space where you would be undisturbed. Ensure proper ventilation to let out any smoke or fumes created during the ritual. Wear comfortable and unrestricting clothes, preferably black or dark in color.

2. Cleanse the space using palo santo, sage, or any other preferred smudging material. Visualize negative energies dissipating and let the smoke fill the area.

3. Construct the Circle of Severance by drawing a protective circle using sea salt or chalk, big enough for you to comfortably sit and move within. Adorn the circle with an ancient Sigil of Severance at each of the cardinal points; these sigils will amplify your intention to sever the cords of attachment.

The Ritual:

1. Sit in a comfortable position within the Circle of Severance. In a fireproof dish, create a mixture of wormwood and mugwort. This choice of herbs is purposeful; wormwood is known for its ability to dispel and remove negative influences, while mugwort enhances psychic awareness and amplifies the clarity of intention.

2. Ignite the herbs, allowing the fumes to rise towards the Sigil of Severance at the North; this cardinal point represents both endings and beginnings, and strengthening your connection to the intention of the ritual. Breathe in the sacred herbal aroma and visualize the energy around you attuning to the task at hand.

3. Chant the enigmatic incantation in ancient Sumerian:

Lugal-abzu inim-nam-erim mubi-an-ki badim!
(Spirits of the deep, sever the ties that bind us!)

Dingir-ušumgal mu-un-dar kur-ra-ni mu-un-zu!
(Great serpents cut through that what weakens us!)

Enbilulu-gugal niĝ-dar kul-ĝuru mi-ni-in!
(Masters of the waters cleanse and liberate me!)

4. As you repeat the incantation, envision the detrimental energetic cords that connect you to the individual(s) in question. Visualize these cords being infused with the potent energy of the incantation and the Sigil of Severance. The ethereal knife cuts through the cords, signifying the release of detrimental connections and the cessation of harmful interactions.

5. After the cords have been severed, allow the herbs to burn out naturally. Dispose of the remaining ash by releasing it into a flowing body of water, signifying the finality of the severance.

6. Close the Circle of Severance by wiping away the salt or chalk and verbally thanking the spirits and energies that have aided you in this ritual.

This meticulously devised Sabbatic ritual, infused with significant symbols, herbs, and incantations, ensures the precise and powerful removal of malevolent attachments and detrimental energetic cords. By carrying out this ritual, one can expect an increased ability to navigate social interactions and personal relationships with a clear aura, free from unwanted energetic influences.
