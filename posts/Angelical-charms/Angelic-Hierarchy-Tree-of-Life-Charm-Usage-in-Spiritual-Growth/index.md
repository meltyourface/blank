To fully grasp the underlying principles behind the creation and usage of angelical charms, we must explore the history, structure, and practices that surround the notion of angels and the esoteric realm. We will first discuss the hierarchical structure of angelic beings, followed by their association with the Tree of Life in Qabalistic tradition, and finally, analyze the impact these beings have on human perception and our spiritual progression.

The hierarchy of angelic beings has its roots in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, but elements of angelic hierarchy can be found in other religious and spiritual systems as well. The 5th-century theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was among the first to formalize this hierarchy, which was later expanded upon by medieval scholars and mystics like Saint Thomas Aquinas and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. According to the standard classification, angelic beings are divided into nine orders or choirs, organized into three triads:

1. First Triad:
    
    a. Seraphim (highest and closest to the divine)
    b. Cherubim
    c. Thrones
    
2. Second Triad:
    
    a. Dominions
    b. Virtues
    c. Powers
    
3. Third Triad:
    
    a. Principalities
    b. Archangels
    c. Angels (lowest and closest to humanity)

Each of these orders is said to possess unique characteristics, functions, and areas of influence that contribute to the overall harmony and order of the universe. Angelical charms, sigils, and invocations are designed with these distinctions in mind, utilizing the unique energies and properties of specific angelic beings to achieve a particular purpose or enhance a specific aspect of life.

The association of these angelic beings with the Tree of Life in the Qabalistic tradition is particularly fascinating, as it provides additional context for the use and design of angelical charms. The Tree of Life consists of 10 spheres called Sephirot, each of which represents an aspect of divinity and the unfolding of creation. Angels are assigned to specific Sephirot according to their rank and function, as follows:

1. Malkuth: Angels
2. Yesod: Archangels
3. Hod: Beni Elohim (Sons of God)
4. Netzach: Elohim (Gods)
5. Tiphereth: Malachim (Kings)
6. Geburah: Seraphim
7. Chesed: Chashmalim (Brilliant Ones)
8. Binah: Aralim (Thrones)
9. Chokmah: Ophanim (Wheels)
10. Kether: Chaioth Ha Qadesh (Holy Living Creatures)

By incorporating the energy from a particular Sephira with the appropriate angelic order's sigils and invocations, practitioners can harness these celestial forces for empowerment, protection, or spiritual growth. Furthermore, the interconnected pathways between the Sephirot reveal a map of the soul's journey and the aspirant's spiritual progress.

The influence of angelic beings on human perception and spiritual growth can be profound. Through the study, meditation, and invocation of these celestial entities, individuals can gain deeper insight into themselves and the world around them. Experiences with angels can facilitate healing, self-discovery, and transformation as individuals learn to attune themselves to higher vibrations and tap into the wellspring of divine wisdom.

In conclusion, the underlying principles behind the creation and usage of angelical charms include understanding the hierarchy of angels, their attributions to the Tree of Life, and their influence on human perception and spiritual growth. By recognizing and honoring these celestial beings' innate properties, talents, and functions, individuals can effectively work with their essence to bring about healing, wisdom, and transformation in their lives. By aligning with these divine forces, one can progress on the path of spiritual evolution and enjoy a deeper connection to the angelic realm.
