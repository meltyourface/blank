3. Step-by-step guide to invoking the Archangels:

1. Light a white, blue, or violet candle to represent Divine Presence.
2. Sit or stand comfortably with your palms facing upwards, and close your eyes.
3. Take deep, cleansing breaths as you visualize yourself surrounded by white light.
4. In a clear and confident voice, recite the invocations for each Archangel, beginning with Michael and proceeding clockwise through the Angelical hierarchy.
5. Envision each Archangel entering the sacred space, their presence signified by the color and energy of their sigil and realm.
6. Ask for their guidance, healing, and support in addressing the specific emotional wounds afflicting you or the person seeking healing.
7. Meditate, focusing on the positive energy of the Archangels and how they can facilitate emotional healing.
8. When the meditation is complete, thank each Archangel individually for their assistance and blessings.
9. Gently extinguish the candle.

4. Additional Elements:

- Use crystals that resonate with the Archangels' energies, such asamethyst, aquamarine, carnelian, and rose quartz.

5. Personalized Affirmations and Prayers:

Create individual affirmations addressing the emotional wounds you wish to heal. Recite these alongside the invocations for each Archangel.

6. Follow-up self-care routine and meditation practices:

To sustain the healing effects, commit to a daily meditation practice, focusing on visualization and breathwork. Perform acts of self-care, such as engaging in relaxing activities, journaling, or spending time in nature.

7. Post-ritual actions:

Record experiences, thoughts, and emotions immediately after the ritual in a journal. Express gratitude to the Archangels and benefit the world with acts of kindness, charity, or goodwill.
