Designing an Awen-focused Altar
**Step 1**: Choose a location
Select a quiet, undisturbed location within your home or sacred space to place the altar. Ensure the location is away from direct sunlight to maintain the energy of the altar. Face the altar towards the sunrise (east) or any direction that holds personal significance to you for inspiration and creativity.
**Step 2**: Select a base
Choose a sturdy surface as the base for your altar. It can be a simple wooden table, stone slab, or even a repurposed box. Ensure that the base is clean, stable, and strong enough to hold the sacred objects that you will place upon it.
**Step 3**: Cleanse the space
Before setting up your altar, cleanse the space using sage, palo santo, or any preferred method of energy cleansing. This will clear any residual energy and create a clean slate for your Awen-focused altar.
**Step 4**: Arrange the Awen symbols
Place the Awen symbol at the center of your altar to represent divine creative inspiration. The Awen symbol comprises three rays descending from a central point, representing the harmonious balance between nature, body, and spirit. You can use an engraved stone, wooden carving, or a hand-drawn symbol on parchment paper, depending on your personal preference.
**Step 5**: Incorporating the elements
To represent the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire), place corresponding objects in the cardinal directions around the Awen symbol.

Earth: Place a small dish of salt or soil in the north.
Water: Place a vial or bowl of water in the west.
Air: Place a feather, incense, or bell in the east.
Fire: Place a candle or a symbol of the sun in the south.
**Step 6**: Add personal items
Incorporate personal items that hold spiritual significance to you and symbolize creativity and inspiration. These can include crystals (such as quartz, amethyst, or citrine), plants, or artifacts representing Celtic or Druidic culture.
**Step 7**: Consecrating the altar
Now that your altar is set up, consecrate the space by performing a simple ritual. Light the candle representing fire, and while focusing on the Awen symbol, recite a prayer or invocation for connection to divine inspiration, creativity, and wisdom. You may also want to perform a ritual using natural elements, such as offering a libation of honey or mead, to connect with the forces of nature.
**Step 8**: Maintaining the connection
To maintain your connection to Awen, regularly spend time at your altar for meditation, contemplation, and creative pursuits. Additionally, you may engage in rituals celebrating the cycles of the moon, solstices, and equinoxes, as well as traditional Druidic practices such as tree meditations and the study of Ogham.

By constructing and consecrating your Awen-focused altar with a careful selection of symbols, materials, and traditional practices, you create a sacred space that will facilitate your connection to divine inspiration and support your spiritual growth within Druidry.
