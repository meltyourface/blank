To devise an in-depth Western occultism-based astrological chart interpretation for an individual, we must first gather some key information about the person's natal chart to ensure accuracy when incorporating the Hermetic, Kabbalistic, and Tree of Life correspondences. 

1. **Date of birth**: January 1, 1985
2. **Time of birth**: 12:00 PM
3. **Place of birth**: New York City, New York

With this information in hand, generate the individual's natal chart. We will now analyze the positions of the celestial bodies within their respective zodiac signs, focusing on aspects, planetary dignities, and house placements.

Sun in Capricorn (2nd House): Ambitious and persistent, this individual seeks material security and possesses a natural talent for business. Ruled by Saturn, there may be a focus on structure and responsibility.

Moon in Cancer (8th House): The Moon is in its natural domicile in Cancer, indicating an emotional and nurturing disposition. The 8th House corresponds to transformation, also hinting at an interest in the occult.

The incorporation of the Tree of Life's principles further enhances this analysis. The Sun's placement in Capricorn corresponds to the Sephira of Binah, the realm of form, and the Moon's placement in Cancer corresponds to the Sephira of Chesed, the realm of mercy and abundance.

Mercury in Sagittarius (1st House): Communication revolves around philosophical and spiritual ideas. The individual may be drawn to foreign cultures, travel, and lifelong learning.

Venus in Aquarius (3rd House): Relationships are built on intellectual stimulation and freedom.

Mars in Pisces (4th House): Emotional energy is channeled into creative and spiritual pursuits.

Jupiter in Capricorn (2nd House): Expansion is sought through material gain and wealth. The individual strives to become an authority figure in their field.

Saturn in Scorpio (12th House): Karmic lessons revolve around relinquishing control.

Uranus in Sagittarius (1st House): The individual seeks to break free from societal norms and forge a unique path.

The threefold nature of the astral influences are essential in this chart analysis. The fixed stars Aldebaran, Alnilam, and Antares are to be reckoned with. Ruled by Mars, their influence enhances ambition and courage. 

The Grand Trine featuring Mercury, Jupiter, and Uranus in Fire signs creates immense talent and potential in the individual for personal growth, success, knowledge, and spirituality.

The T-Square involving Mars, Saturn, and the Sun signals internal conflicts between one's creative energies, authority, and responsibilities, urging the individual to find a balance between their inner and outer lives.

In this comprehensive analysis of the individual's esoteric potential, we see a strong alignment with the Hermetic principles of As Above, So Below and the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. The individual is destined for spiritual, emotional, and material growth, as well as potentially attaining wisdom in the occult and esoteric realms.
