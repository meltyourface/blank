To answer this knowledge challenge, let us first delve into the concepts of dream work, meditation, and visualization individually before integrating them into a daily routine to enhance clairvoyant abilities. We will then explore the interconnectedness of these practices with the body, mind, and higher consciousness.

1. **Dream Work**: Dream work is the practice of remembering, interpreting, and finding meanings in one's dreams. It is believed that dreams provide insights into our subconscious minds and can serve as a window to spiritual dimensions. Ancient esoteric traditions often utilized dream work to receive prophetic messages, communicate with spiritual guides, and decode symbolic meanings.

2. **Meditation**: Meditation is a practice that helps in cultivating mindfulness, awareness, and mental clarity. By focusing one's mind on a particular thought, object, or activity, it helps eliminate extraneous thoughts and distractions. This creates a peaceful state of mind, promoting relaxation, inner peace, and self-discovery.

3. **Visualization**: Visualization is the practice of using mental imagery to create sensory experiences in the mind. It involves forming a mental picture or scenario to develop specific skills, overcome challenges, or manifest desires. Esoteric traditions often employ visualization techniques as a way to channel energy and connect with higher states of consciousness.

Now, let's proceed to synthesize these practices in a daily routine to enhance clairvoyant abilities, while acknowledging their interconnection with the body, mind, and higher consciousness.
**Step 1**: Establish a morning ritual: Start your day by waking up early and setting an intention for your practice. Find a quiet and serene space where you can sit comfortably, free from interruptions. Ground yourself by mindfully connecting to your breath, experiencing the inflow and outflow of air through your nose and lungs.
**Step 2**: Begin with meditation: Engage in mindful meditation by focusing your attention on your breath, a mantra, or a simple object. As thoughts arise, observe them without judgment, then let them go, bringing your focus back to your breath or chosen focal point. This practice will help create mental clarity and emotional calm that are essential to enhancing your clairvoyant abilities.
**Step 3**: Practice visualization: After your meditation session, transition into visualization exercises. Imagine a scene, object, or person in vivid detail, attempting to make the mental images as realistic as possible. For instance, you could imagine yourself connecting with your spiritual guides or visualize your chakras, the energy centers in your body, becoming balanced and aligned. This practice helps augment your clairvoyant abilities as it strengthens your abilities to perceive and interpret psychic information.
**Step 4**: Incorporate dream work: Before bed, set an intention to remember and explore your dreams each night. Keep a dream journal at your bedside and, upon waking, record any images, symbols, or insights from your dreams. Reflect on these symbols, seeking guidance and inner wisdom that contribute to your clairvoyant development.

In conclusion, a consistent and well-structured daily routine that combines dream work, meditation, and visualization can facilitate the enhancement of clairvoyant abilities. By acknowledging and nurturing the interconnectedness of these practices with the body, mind, and higher consciousness, you allow yourself to develop a deeper understanding of the esoteric realm and cultivate your psychic gifts more effectively.
