## Angelic Magic - A Comprehensive Overview

### I. Purpose and Principles of Working with Angelic Entities

Angelic magic is an esoteric practice that involves the invocation and communication with angelic beings to seek guidance, protection, and assistance in various aspects of life. Unlike other forms of magic that may focus on power or manipulation, angelic magic is based on the principles of love, wisdom, and spiritual growth. It is believed that through working with these divine entities, practitioners can align themselves with universal energies and consciousness to enhance their spiritual development.

Angels are considered to be celestial messengers and intermediaries between the divine and human realms. They exist outside of the constraints of time and space, and their role is to aid, support, and provide insight into our lives. By invoking their presence, practitioners of angelic magic aim to foster a deep connection with their own spirituality and the divine.

### II. Various Types of Angels

Angels are classified into a hierarchy known as the celestial order. This order consists of nine choirs or categories, each with its unique set of responsibilities, attributes, and symbols. **These include**:

1. Seraphim – These angels are the closest to the divine source and are responsible for maintaining the celestial order. They symbolize love, light, and purity.
2. Cherubim – Cherubim are associated with wisdom, knowledge, and divine mystery. They serve as guardians of sacred knowledge and protectors of the heavenly realms.
3. Thrones – Thrones represent divine justice and balance. They ensure that cosmic harmony is maintained and provide support for divine consciousness.
4. Dominions – Dominions are responsible for overseeing the various aspects of creation and managing the universe's energies in a manner that supports harmony.
5. Virtues – Virtues are concerned with providence and miracles, offering guidance and support to those seeking to manifest their higher selves.
6. Powers – Powers work to maintain the natural and spiritual laws of creation. Additionally, they often serve as protectors against negative energies.
7. Principalities – These angels govern larger groups and communities, seeking to establish harmony and unity among humanity and facilitate spiritual growth.
8. Archangels – Archangels hold specific roles within the celestial hierarchy, providing guidance and protection for individuals, groups and even the entire human race. They also play a crucial role in spiritual development.
9. Guardian Angels – Each individual is believed to have a personal guardian angel who provides guidance, protection, and assistance in their life's journey.

### III. Common Tools used in Angelic Magic

Working with angelic magic often involves the use of specific tools and objects to help create a harmonious environment, focusing intention and facilitating energetic connections. **Some of these common tools include**:

1. Candles – Representing the element of fire, candles are used to evoke angelic energies and create a sacred space for communication.
2. Crystals – Crystals can serve as conduits for healing energies and attuning to specific angelic frequencies. Some popular choices are clear quartz, rose quartz, and amethyst.
3. Incense – Incense helps promote a meditative state and purify the ritual space. Commonly used varieties include frankincense, myrrh, and sandalwood.
4. Sigils and Symbols – Angels are associated with specific symbols and sigils that can be used to invoke their energies. These can be drawn, inscribed, or engraved on objects to enhance their power.

### IV. Step-by-Step Instructions for a Beginner-friendly Ritual

The following ritual is designed to establish a connection with your personal Guardian Angel. It can be adapted as needed to invoke other angelic beings.

1. Prepare your ritual space by lighting candles and incense, and arranging any crystals or objects you wish to incorporate.
2. Sit comfortably in a quiet and relaxed environment, allowing yourself to settle into a meditative state.
3. Take several deep, cleansing breaths, focusing your intention on opening your heart and mind to the presence of your Guardian Angel.
4. Visualize a brilliant white light surrounding you, merging with your energy field, and creating a protective barrier that transcends the physical realm.
5. **Recite the following invocation or one of your choosing**: "I call upon my Guardian Angel, celestial companion, and divine protector. I seek your guidance, your wisdom, and your loving presence. I ask that you reveal yourself to me, that we may work together to fulfill my spiritual journey and soul purpose."
6. Holding your intention and open heart, visualize the presence of your Guardian Angel materializing within the white light. Allow any images, sensations, or messages to come forth.
7. Continue to meditate with your Guardian Angel, asking for guidance, healing, or insights on your path.
8. Once you feel the connection has been established, and you’ve received your guidance, thank your Guardian Angel for their presence and assistance.
9. Gently dissolve the image of the white light, and ground yourself by taking a few deep breaths, tapping into your physical senses and connecting to your surroundings.

By understanding the principles and practices of angelic magic and applying them in a respectful and heartfelt manner, students can deepen their connection to their spiritual selves and the divine. As with all spiritual pursuits, remember that practice and patience are key components for success.
