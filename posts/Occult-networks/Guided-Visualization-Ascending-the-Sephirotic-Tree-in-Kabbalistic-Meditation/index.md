Guided Visualization 1: Ascending the Sephirotic Tree

1. Begin by finding a quiet, comfortable space where you won't be disturbed. Sit or lie down, and close your eyes.

2. Take several deep, cleansing breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each exhale, release any tension or stress you may be holding in your body.

3. Visualize yourself standing in front of a tall, ancient tree, glowing with otherworldly light. This is the Sephirotic Tree, a representation of the divine emanations within the Kabbalistic tradition. Each of its ten spheres, or Sephirot, represents a different aspect of creation and spiritual growth.

4. As you gaze upon the tree, feel a warm, protective energy enveloping you. This is the presences of the four archangels: Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, and Uriel. Call upon each of them to guard and guide you on your journey by saying their names aloud or silently to yourself.

5. Begin by grounding yourself with the first Sephirah, Malkuth, located at the base of the tree. Visualize your feet connecting to the earth, strong and rooted, as you prepare to climb.

6. As you ascend to the next Sephirah, Yesod, the Foundation, focus on balancing and stabilizing your energies. Envision a silver, luminous sphere surrounding you, anchoring your astral form.

7. Continue to climb the tree, invoking each Sephirah and its associated energies:

- Hod, the sphere of intellect and communication, represented by a brilliant orange light.
- Netzach, the sphere of emotion and passion, bathed in emerald green.
- Tiferet, the harmonious center of the tree, where divine balance and beauty reside, glowing with a warm golden light.
- Geburah, the sphere of strength and courage, radiating a vivid red.
- Chesed, the energy of kindness and compassion, enveloped in a soothing sky blue.

8. Moving higher, connect with Binah, the sphere of divine understanding, and absorb its inky black wisdom.

9. Cross over to the opposite side, connecting with Chokmah, the realm of divine will and dynamic force, radiating a brilliant blue-white light.

10. Finally, reach the crown of the tree, Kether, the highest Sephirah, embracing the infinite white brilliance of pure consciousness and transcendent unity.

11. As you stand in Kether's light, allow the wisdom, energy, and transformative power of each Sephirah you've connected with to become fully absorbed into your being.

12. Slowly descend the Sephirotic Tree, acknowledging and thanking each sphere and the guiding archangels for accompanying you on your journey.

13. When you reach the earth once more, take a moment to ground yourself, feeling the connection to the physical plane. Gently bring your awareness back to your body, wiggle your fingers and toes, and take a few deep breaths.

14. When you are ready, open your eyes, returning to the present moment with newfound clarity, wisdom, and empowerment.

This is just the beginning of the series of guided visualizations tailored to occult networks. As you progress, you will delve deeper into the astral plane, encountering a variety of spirits, guides, symbols, and experiences that will lead you not only to a more profound and vivid astral experience but a greater understanding of your own spiritual potential.
