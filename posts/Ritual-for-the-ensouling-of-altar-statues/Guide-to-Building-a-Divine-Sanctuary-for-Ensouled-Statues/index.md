To construct a sanctified chamber for enshrining and safeguarding an altar statue imbued with a powerful ensouling ritual, one needs to follow a series of intricate steps. These steps are detailed below with the essential particulars.

1. **Selecting the Location**: The first step is selecting a location that is both isolated and spiritually charged. Look for a place away from distractions and negative energies, such as a secluded room, a basement, or a garden shed. It's essential to ensure that the area is clean, quiet, and free from disturbances. To strengthen the spiritual energies, choose a place with access to natural light, air, and clean surroundings.

2. **Gathering Materials**: The materials used in constructing the sanctified chamber should be of high quality, ethically sourced, and with no negative associations. Traditional materials for creating such a chamber include marble, sandstone, or wood, depending on the cultural and regional preferences. Adornments and altar decorations should incorporate precious metals such as gold or silver, and precious stones like sapphire, quartz, or amethyst that are known for their spiritual resonance.

3. **Design and Layout**: The design and layout of the chamber should be based on principles of sacred geometry, with specific dimensions chosen to refine the energies within the space. The dimensions of the chamber, altar, and statue should follow the Golden Ratio, enhancing the resonance with the divine. The east-west alignment should be maintained, with the altar statue placed at the eastern end of the chamber, facing west towards the worshippers entering the space. The layout may also feature sacred symbols or images that enhance the spiritual potency of the chamber.

4. **Purification and Grounding**: Before beginning the construction, purify and ground the space through rituals such as smudging, aspersions with water, or burning incense. This process will cleanse the area of any negative energies and prepare it for the sanctified chamber's construction.

5. **Construction**: Carefully begin building the sanctified chamber using the materials and dimensions chosen during the planning stages, ensuring that the highest quality and craftsmanship are maintained throughout.

6. **Consecration**: Once completed, consecrate the sanctified chamber through rituals specific to the ensouling tradition. Depending on the cultural context and spiritual beliefs of those involved, this may involve invoking divine spirits, performing offerings such as flowers, food, or libations, or reciting specific mantras or prayers.

7. **Ensouling of the Altar Statue**: With the sanctified chamber completed and consecrated, the altar statue's ensouling can commence. This could involve several stages, such as animating the statue through animation rites, invoking the deity connected to the statue and inviting its presence into the space through mantras, prayers, or offerings. Finally, the energies will be sealed, and the statue will serve as a divine channel within the sanctified chamber.

8. **Strengthening Ethereal Energies**: To maintain the spiritual potency of the sanctified chamber, perform regular rituals to cleanse and strengthen the ethereal energies surrounding the space. This may include purifying the area through smudging or aspersions, offering to the altar statue, or chanting specific mantras or prayers that resonate with the ensouling of the statue.

By following these intricate procedures, the consecration and construction of a sanctified chamber for enshrining and safeguarding an altar statue imbued with a powerful ensouling ritual will ensure a potent and spiritually resonant space, sacred and protected from negative influences.
