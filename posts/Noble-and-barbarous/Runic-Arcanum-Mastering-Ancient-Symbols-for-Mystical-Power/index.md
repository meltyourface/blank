I present to you a comprehensive and intricate system to harness the primal powers of ancient runes within mystical rituals and ceremonies, fusing Noble and barbarous lineage. The system is known as the Runic Arcanum. 

1. Categorization of Runes:
The runes are categorized based on their domain of influence, such as elemental, celestial, ethereal, and monstrous. Each rune possesses a primary attribute that signifies its innate power, as well as a secondary attribute that provides additional context to the rune's meaning or functionality. 

2. Primary Rune Attributes:
These define the core essence of each rune, such as: a) Elemental (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) b) Celestial (Sun, Moon, Stars, Void) c) Ethereal (Life, Death, Eternity, Transformation) d) Monstrous (Strength, Cunning, Endurance, Adaptation)

3. Secondary Rune Attributes:
These provide further depth and nuance to each rune's meaning, such as: a) Associated deities or mythological figures b) Unique geometrical shapes or patterns within the rune c) Esoteric properties (e.g., binding, protection, communication) d) Dual nature (e.g., antithesis, harmonizing forces, polarity)

4. Guide to Runic Interpretation:
The Runic Arcanum explains the historically significant meanings and modern re-interpretations of each rune. For example, it will show the interpretation of each rune in isolation, provide information on established runic combinations, and offer guidance on how to discern new meaning by combining runes in novel ways.

5. Amplification of Runic Potency:
Methods to enhance the power and symbology of runic combinations include: a) Invocation of higher powers and spirits by reciting incantations and prayers b) Charging the runes with elemental energies, using crystals, metals, or other natural materials c) Aligning the runes with specific astrological events, planetary alignments, or celestial bodies d) Conducting the rituals in sacred spaces and ancient places of power

6. Comprehensive Runic Compendium:
The accompanying compendium, a tome titled "Arcana Runarum", includes vivid illustrations and in-depth narratives on each rune. It covers the history, mythologies, and esoteric significance of the runes, as well as their magical applications within rituals. The compendium serves as a practical and educational tool for students of the Runic Arcanum.

By creating such an elaborate and rich system, practitioners will gain a deep understanding and connection with both the Noble and barbarous aspects of the arcane powers that these ancient runes embody. Thus, they can harness them effectively in their mystical rituals and ceremonies while preserving the enigmatic and mysterious allure which made them so compelling throughout history.
