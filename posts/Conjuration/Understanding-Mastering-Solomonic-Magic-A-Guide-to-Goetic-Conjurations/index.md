To provide an exhaustive and comprehensive response to this complex challenge, it is important to first lay the foundation for the understanding of the Lesser Key of Solomon, Goetic hierarchy, and their relation to astrological and elemental associations within a conjured ritual. Following that, we will delve into the correlation between these aspects and how they culminate in manifesting specific outcomes. Lastly, we will explore the considerations necessary for adapting the ritual to achieve harmony without adverse consequences.

The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as Clavicula Salomonis Regis or Lemegeton, is a renowned grimoire, primarily known for its detailed account of the seventy-two demons of the Ars Goetia. Written in the 17th century, this ancient text describes a series of complex rituals and processes for conjuring and controlling these powerful spirits.

The Goetic hierarchy refers to the ranking of these spirits, which are often categorized as infernal or malevolent. Each spirit possesses unique attributes, ranging from abilities to bestow knowledge, cause destruction, or even offer protection, depending on the practitioner's intentions. In classical Solomonic magic, authority over these spirits is claimed on the basis of divine sanction; invoking God's power and employing divine names to compel the spirits' obedience during the conjuration process.

Astrological associations play a significant role in correlating the Goetic hierarchy to the conjured ritual, as each of the seventy-two spirits corresponds to a specific astrological sign. Additionally, elemental associations (air, fire, water, and earth) are attributed to each spirit, depending on their traits and the sphere of influence they exert.

To manifest specific outcomes within a conjured ritual, one must consider the following primary factors:

1) The selection of the appropriate Goetic spirit according to its attributed powers and qualities, as well as compatibility with the desired outcome.
2) Accurate alignment of the astrological associations and timing of the ritual to correspond with the chosen spirit's favored planetary influence.
3) Inclusion of the corresponding elemental association to enhance the spirit's energy and efficacy during the conjuration process.

Now, let us consider the essential adaptations of a conjured ritual to harmonize the energies of the Goetic hierarchy without adverse consequences:

1) Establish a clear aim: Define the desired outcome and intention for the ritual and adhere to a specific, well-considered plan.
2) Ethical invocation: Approach the spirits with respect and follow the tenets of beneficent magic, refraining from malevolent or selfish intentions.
3) Maintain authority: Uphold the power dynamics between the conjurer and the spirit and ensure the spirit remains under control by utilizing divine names and sacred symbols.
4) Protective measures: Employ traditional ritual elements such as salt, incense, and holy water to create a protective barrier around the ritual space.
5) Unambiguous dismissal: Ensure a clear, properly executed closure at the end of the ritual, releasing the spirit with gratitude and firmly closing the energetic portal.

In summary, the Lesser Key of Solomon and its Goetic hierarchy encompass a complex body of knowledge intrinsically tied to astrological and elemental associations, which are utilized in conjured rituals to manifest specific outcomes. Achieving harmony within these rituals requires a comprehensive understanding of the attributes, correspondences, and powers attributed to the Goetic spirits, as well as the maintenance of ethical principles and thorough protective measures. By mastering these aspects and adapting the ritual accordingly, it becomes possible to work with the Goetic hierarchy without inciting adverse consequences.
