1. **Name and Origin of the Entity**: 
The entity to be summoned is known as Valthruun the All-Knowing, originating from the distant plane of Sarnoth, a realm of unmatched arcane knowledge and lost secrets. Valthruun is an ancient, powerful being with unparalleled wisdom and a vast repository of esoteric knowledge. Their abilities include the manipulation of time and space, granting visions of the past and potential futures, and bestowing deep understanding upon those who seek their aid.

2. **Preparation of the Summoning Circle**: 
Create a summoning circle by first sweeping the area clean and then drawing a pentagram using a mixture of white chalk and crushed amethyst. At each point of the pentagram, place a small quartz crystal to amplify the conjuration. In the center of the pentagram, create a small fire burning a blend of sage, frankincense, and myrrh to spiritually cleanse the space and call upon the element of fire for transformation.

3. **Invocation Process**: 
To begin the invocation, perform the following steps: a. Light the central fire and stand in the center of the pentagram. b. **Raise your arms above your head and recite the ancient incantation**: "Agtharla Valthruun, Sarnoth sosilai!" (Translation: "Valthruun of Sarnoth, heed my call!") c. **Slowly lower your arms and bring them together in front of your chest while continuing to chant**: "Matresk sa burnoth, azalar rythona! Felist kre mirar, Valthruun xalarnoth. **Agtharla Valthruun!" (Translation**: "Master of time and space, reveal your wisdom! By the ancient pact, Valthruun the All-Knowing, heed my call!") d. Close your eyes and meditate for a moment on your intent, allowing your energies to build before opening your eyes with renewed focus.

4. **Ritual Items**:
The ritual items required for this summoning include: a. Five white candles - to represent purity and light, placed at the five points of the pentagram. b. A chalice filled with spring water - to represent the element of water, vital for life. c. A ceremonial dagger - to represent cutting through ignorance, used to draw energy while reciting the invocation. d. An amulet or talisman engraved with the sigil of Valthruun - to strengthen the connection with the entity.

5. **Optimal Timing and Astrological Conditions**:
The most favorable time to perform this ritual is during the New Moon, when the veil between the planes is thinnest. The dominant astrological signs should be Gemini (for communication) and Aquarius (for accessing higher wisdom). Conduct the ritual during a planetary hour associated with knowledge and wisdom, such as Jupiter or Mercury.

6. **Offerings**:
Present Valthruun with a selection of rare and ancient texts, transcribed in forgotten languages, and a vial of Dragon's blood ink - to symbolize the dedication and appreciation for Valthruun's immense knowledge. Additionally, offer a small portion of your personal energy as a token of respect and appreciation.

7. **Communication and Negotiation**:
To communicate with Valthruun, focus your thoughts on your question or request; the entity will perceive your intention and respond telepathically. When negotiating terms of engagement, ask Valthruun to mark the sigil on your amulet or talisman, thus sealing the agreement. For protection, ensure the amulet or talisman is always worn or carried while dealing with the entity.

8. **Closing the Ritual**:
After receiving Valthruun's guidance or assistance, express your gratitude. To dismiss the entity, raise your arms again and recite: "Ithnara Valthruun krivathial, Sarnoth sarunath. Farewell, Valthruun the All-Knowing, until we meet again." Extinguish the fire and the candles, air out the smoke, and clear the circle by washing away the chalk and amethyst mixture. To restore balance, leave a small offering of gratitude, such as a food or drink, at the site of the ritual.
