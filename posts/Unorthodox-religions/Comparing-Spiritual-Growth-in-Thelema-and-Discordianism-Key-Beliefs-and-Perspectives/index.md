To address this knowledge challenge, we will first provide an overview of the essential elements of Thelema and Discordianism, diving deeper into their respective gods, moral codes, and ultimate goals. Following this, we will consider how these differences might influence the personal spiritual experience and growth of their initiates.

Thelema and Discordianism are both relatively modern belief systems with esoteric origins. Thelema was founded by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, drawing upon his experiences with esoteric and occult practices, as well as his encounters with spiritual entities. Discordianism, created in the late 20th century by Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst, is a more eclectic belief system, known for its humor, satire, and embracing of chaos.

Core Beliefs:
1. Gods
Thelema primarily revolves around the worship and understanding of the god-forms Hadit, Nuit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. These three gods respectively represent the infinite potential of existence, the individual point of view, and the divine manifestation of the individual's will. In contrast, Discordianism features Eris, the goddess of chaos and discord. Eris symbolizes the inherent disorder in the universe and encourages individuals to embrace randomness and unpredictability.

2. Moral Codes
Thelema espouses a moral code centered on the concept of "Do what thou wilt," which encourages individuals to discover and follow their True Will, the inherent purpose of their existence. This principle is commonly misunderstood as advocating hedonism or selfishness, when in actuality, Thelemites emphasize the need for self-discipline and spiritual development. On the other hand, Discordianism lacks a specific moral code but promotes embracing chaos, parody, and ironic self-awareness as a means to subvert traditional authority and dogma. This leads to a more free-form, individualistic approach to morality.

3. Ultimate Goals
The primary objective of Thelema is to enable individuals to discover and align with their True Will, ultimately achieving a state of spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine. This goal is often pursued through various magical and mystical practices, aimed at realizing the individual's full potential and developing their understanding of the universe. Discordianism's ultimate goal is more nebulous, frequently shifting between promoting individualistic creative expression, moments of cosmic insight, or playfully satirizing organized religion and cultural norms. This fluidity contributes to the spirit of chaos that Discordianism embodies.

Bearing these differences in mind, Thelema and Discordianism can have drastically diverging impacts on the personal spiritual experience and growth of their initiates.

Thelemites are often expected to undertake rigorous spiritual exercises and magical practices to develop their understanding of the self and the universe. This systematic approach to spiritual development can lead to a profound appreciation of the metaphysical underpinnings of existence, and provide a disciplined framework for unfolding one's True Will. Conversely, Discordianism encourages initiates to embrace spontaneity and free expression, fostering an environment of creativity and playfulness. This mindset can lead to moments of profound insight, as well as promoting a more fluid and dynamic approach to spiritual exploration.

In conclusion, Thelema and Discordianism present distinctive belief systems centered on different gods, moral codes, and ultimate goals. Thelema emphasizes the discovery and pursuit of one's True Will, utilizing well-structured spiritual practices in service of this aim. In contrast, Discordianism embraces chaos and eccentricity, championing individualism and creative expression. As a result, initiates of these respective systems may have divergent spiritual experiences and growth trajectories, shaped by the unique philosophies and practices at the core of each path.
