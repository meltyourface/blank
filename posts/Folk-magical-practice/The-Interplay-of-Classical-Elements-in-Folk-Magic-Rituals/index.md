Answering this knowledge challenge requires an in-depth exploration of the fundamental principles of folk-magical practice and a thorough dissection of the profound correlations that exist between the classical elements. By examining these elements and their symbolic affiliations, we can better understand the underlying philosophical constructs that have shaped folk-magical practice, as well as their practical applications in rituals. To that end, this response will address (1) an analysis of the interconnectivity between the four classical elements, (2) the symbolism and associations of these elements with botanical, mineral, and animal elements, and (3) the role each element plays in achieving holistic harmony in a specific magical ritual.

1. Interconnectivity of the Four Classical Elements
Within the realm of folk-magical practice, the four classical elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) act as primordial forces that constitute the fabric of reality. In this framework, these elements are interconnected, as they each govern various aspects of existence, balancing and complementing one another to maintain universal equilibrium. Fundamentally, this system posits that the interplay of these forces orchestrates the natural harmony and order within the universe, as well as the interactions between the individual, environment, and supernatural realm.

2. Symbolism and Associations with Botanical, Mineral, and Animal Elements
Each of the classical elements carries potent symbolism and associations with different botanical, mineral, and animal materials. These associations serve as powerful conduits for the practitioner to tap into the elemental forces that they aim to harness in their magical work.

**Earth**: The element of Earth embodies the principles of grounding, fertility, and material manifestation. In botanical terms, root systems, trees such as the oak, and mosses share Earth's affinity for stability and growth. Minerals such as stones, salt, and minerals of brown and green hues also align with Earth's energy. Correspondingly, animals such as the tortoise, badger, and bear exemplify the grounded and enduring qualities of this element.

**Air**: In contrast, the element of Air encompasses the realms of intellect, communication, and movement. Botanically, plants like lavender, sage, and mint resonate with Air's mental and adaptability-centered qualities. Minerals like pumice, transparent crystals, and feathers – despite being animal in origin – symbolize Air's lightness and fluidity. Birds, butterflies, and dragonflies, which navigate effortlessly through their airborne domains, embody the characteristics of Air.

**Fire**: Representing transformation, passion, and primal energy, the element of Fire is synonymous with vigor and change. Plants with fiery hues, such as red and orange, or those that exude warmth like chili pepper, cinnamon, and sunflower, cultivate Fire's essence. In the mineral world, flint, obsidian, and rubies manifest Fire's energetic forces. The salamander, phoenix, and lion epitomize the whimsical vitality of the Fire element.

**Water**: Lastly, the element of Water is symbolic of emotions, intuition, and fluidity. Plants such as willow, water lilies, and seaweed mirror Water's soothing and nurturing attributes. Minerals like aquamarine, pearls, and sea glass embody the element's calming effects. Animals such as fish, dolphins, and sea turtles encapsulate the element of Water's fluidity and grace.

3. Role of Elements in Achieving Harmony Through a Magical Ritual
In a folk-magical ritual aimed at attaining harmony between the individual, their environment, and the supernatural realm, each of the four elements holds a specific role, ensuring the comprehensive stability in the ritual. For instance, a practitioner may perform a ritual involving each of the elements in the following ways:

- Earth acts as a grounding force, connecting the practitioner to the physical world, and reminding the practitioner of their tangible connection to all living beings. It also provides a sense of stability and focus, both in intention and in anchoring the environment for magical work.
- Air fosters intellectual acuity and communication between the practitioner and the supernatural realm, as well as insight into innate and external wisdom. Air ensures the clarity of intention and enhances the intuitive relationship between the practitioner and the elements.
- Fire serves as a catalyst for transformation and change in the magical working, providing the impetus and passion required to manifest desired outcomes. It also symbolizes the inner fire that drives the will, determination, and courage of the practitioner, and the cleansing and purging of negative energies in the environment.
- Water enriches the ritual through emotional depth and open-heartedness, inviting compassion, empathy, and understanding. By immersing themselves in the currents of emotion, the practitioner establishes a harmonious connection with the environment and the supernatural.

In conclusion, the interconnectivity of the four classical elements in folk-magical practice stems from their integral roles as pillars of existence. Examining both the symbolism and associations that link the elements to botanical, mineral, and animal realms, one can unwrap a profound tapestry of correspondences that collectively channel the essence of these elemental forces. By incorporating these components in ritual, a practitioner seeks to attain harmony between the individual, environment, and supernatural realm, by tapping into the energies of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water in their pursuit of balance and interconnectedness.
