1. Ingredients and Quantities:

- 50 ml of Aqua Aurum (a purified water infused with gold particles, known for its restorative properties)
- 10 drops of Moonflower essence (harvested during the full moon for maximum potency)
- 1 g of powdered Black Tourmaline (for protection and grounding)
- 5 flakes of Angelica root (an herb used for enhancing spiritual connections)
- 1 Dragonfly wing (for energy transformation)
- 3 pinches of Celestite powder (a crystal used for spiritual and angelic communication)

2. Environmental Conditions:

Ideal environmental conditions include:

- Brewing during a waxing moon, as it represents a time of growth and expansion.
- Planetary alignment with the sun, moon, and Jupiter, known for their amplifying effects on spiritual matters.
- A quiet, sacred space where the potion maker can connect with the ingredients' energies during the process.

3. Brewing Process:

- Begin with boiling the Aqua Aurum in a copper cauldron over a low flame.
- Once the water reaches a steady simmer, add the Moonflower essence while invoking the moon's energy.
- Add powdered Black Tourmaline, stirring counterclockwise three times.
- Recite an incantation for protection and cleansing, such as "Cleanse and purify, within and without; negative energies, be banished, no doubt."
- Add the flakes of Angelica root, stirring clockwise seven times.
- Incorporate the Dragonfly wing while reciting a chant for transformation, like "I embrace change and shift my sight to view new horizons with clear light."
- Add the Celestite powder, stirring counterclockwise nine times.
- Complete the brewing process with a final incantation, such as "Purified and mended, my aura shines bright; ethereal energy, renewed and full of light."
- Allow the potion to cool and pour through a fine mesh strainer to remove any solids.

4. Variations and Augmentations:

- For enhanced aura-strengthening effects, add 7 g of powdered Clear Quartz and chant an affirmation of empowerment.
- For heightened spiritual communication, use 5 ml of essential oil of Frankincense instead of Celestite powder.
- Those seeking more tranquility in their energy field can add 10 drops of Lavender essence in place of Moonflower essence.

5. Preservation, Storage, and Consumption:

- Preserve the potion in a dark amber glass bottle sealed with beeswax to prevent degradation from light exposure.
- Store it in a cool, dry place, where it remains undisturbed except during intentional use.
- Consume the potion in small doses; begin with taking 5 drops under the tongue during morning meditation.
- Monitor the effects on your aura via visualization, energy work, or aura photography. Adjust dosage and frequency as needed.
