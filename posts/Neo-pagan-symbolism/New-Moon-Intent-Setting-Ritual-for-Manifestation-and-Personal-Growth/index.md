New Moon Intention Setting Ritual with Neo-Pagan Symbolism

1. Preparation
Begin by choosing a quiet, clean space where you can perform the ritual without interruption. ****Prepare the altar with a traditional pentagram layout, using elemental correspondences for each point****: Earth at the top left, Air at the top right, Fire at the bottom left, Water at the bottom right, and Spirit at the center top.

2. Ritual Tools
For this ritual, you will need the following:

- A small bowl of sea salt to represent Earth
- A stick of incense or handheld fan to represent Air
- A red or orange candle for Fire 
- A bowl of water or chalice for Water
- A small quartz crystal or clear crystal sphere for Spirit

You should also gather specific crystals and herbs that resonate with lunar energy. **Some examples are**:

- Crystals: Moonstone, selenite, and labradorite
- Herbs: Jasmine, mugwort, and chamomile

Incorporate sacred geometry into the altar layout by arranging your tools in circular or spiral patterns, representing the cycles of the moon and the interconnectedness of all things.

3. Invoking Deities or Spirit Guides
Begin by meditating quietly and grounding yourself in the ritual space. **When you feel centered, call upon the deities or spirit guides that resonate with your intention for the New Moon. Here are some examples**:

- For abundance and prosperity, invoke the Norse goddess Freyja or the Hindu goddess Lakshmi.
- For personal growth and transformation, call upon the Egyptian god Thoth or the Greek goddess Persephone.
- For healing and protection, turn to the Celtic goddess Brigid or the Sumerian goddess Inanna.

4. Personalized Sigils
To amplify the ritual's potency, create a personalized sigil. A sigil is a symbol that represents your intention. Start by writing down your intention in a clear and concise manner. Then, remove any repeating letters and vowels from the written phrase. Using the remaining letters, begin forming a unique symbol that embodies your intention. Charge the sigil by focusing your energy on it, then place it prominently on your altar.

5. Meditative Practices
Incorporate meditation throughout the ritual process to enhance connection with the collective unconscious and strengthen manifestation. Begin and end the ritual with grounding meditations to establish a solid foundation and to close the connection with the energies invoked. During the invocation of deities or spirit guides, practice deep breathing and visualizations to attune to their energies.

As you empower your sigil, use visualization and breath work to channel energy into the symbol. Imagine the energies of the New Moon and the deities you have invoked flowing into the sigil, infusing it with power.

6. Closing the Ritual
To close the ritual, thank the deities or spirit guides you invoked, and release their energies back to the universe. Snuff out the candle, let the incense burn out, and dispose of the remaining herbs in an environmentally-friendly manner. Spend some time reflecting on your intention and the energies cultivated during the ritual. Carry the charged sigil with you or place it somewhere meaningful to remind you of your intention and the lunar energy surrounding it.

As you continue on your path, revisit your intention at the subsequent Full Moon and assess your progress. Regularly engaging in this intention-setting ritual can strengthen your connection to the Divine and enhance your manifestation abilities while incorporating Neo-Pagan symbolism and practices.
