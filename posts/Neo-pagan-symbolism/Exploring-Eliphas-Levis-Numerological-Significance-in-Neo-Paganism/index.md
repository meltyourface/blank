Eliphas Levi, born Alphonse Louis Constant, was a French occultist, magician, and influential author in the magical tradition. **His works, especially "Transcendental Magic**: Its Doctrine and Ritual," have been deeply influential on the development of contemporary Neo-pagan practices and symbolism. In order to investigate the numerological significance and mystical connections within his name, we will break down his pseudonym, Eliphas Levi, into its individual components and apply various numerological systems to draw connections with Neo-pagan symbolism and principles.

Individual Components of Eliphas Levi:

1. **Eliphas**: This name is derived from Hebrew and signifies "God is my judge." It is composed of six letters, which in numerology corresponds to harmony, balance, and responsibility. **The Pythagorean system assigns the following numerical values for each letter based on their position in the alphabet**:
E = 5, L = 3, I = 9, P = 7, H = 8, A = 1, S = 1.
The sum of these values is 34 (5+3+9+7+8+1+1). **Since numerology operates with single digits, we further reduce this number**: 3+4 = 7. Thus, the Pythagorean number for "Eliphas" is 7.

2. **Levi**: The name Levi comes from Hebrew and means "joined" or "attached." It is also the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. **It comprises four letters, which corresponds to stability and practicality in numerology. The Pythagorean values for these letters are**:
L = 3, E = 5, V = 4, I = 9.
Adding these values together results in 21 (3+5+4+9), further reduced to single digit: 2+1 = 3. Hence, the Pythagorean number for "Levi" is 3.

Esoteric Associations of Numerals:

1. **Tarot Cards**: The number 7 in Tarot corresponds to "The Chariot" card, signaling willpower, triumph over obstacles, and self-confidence. The number 3 is associated with "The Empress" card, symbolizing fertility, creativity, and nurturing. As a synthesis of both 7 and 3, Eliphas Levi's name embodies the balance of the intellect and discipline of the Chariot with the creative and nurturing aspects of the Empress, indicating his role as a teacher and guide in the magical tradition.

2. **Runes**: In the Elder Futhark, the 7th rune is Gebo, signifying the theme of partnership and balance, while the 3rd rune is Ansuz, associated with divine communication and wisdom. The combination of these two runes in Eliphas Levi's name reflects the communication of divine wisdom, which is often at the core of esoteric practices and Neo-pagan symbolism.

3. **Sacred Geometry**: The number 7 is associated with the heptagon and heptagram, symbolizing an integration of the spiritual and material worlds. The number 3 represents the triangle and trinity, signifying mind, body, and spirit in harmony. Together, these numbers emphasize Levi's focus on uniting spirituality and materialism as part of his magical practice.

Interpretation of Insights in Terms of Neo-paganism:

Eliphas Levi's major influence on the development of Neo-pagan practices and symbolism is evident from the numerological and esoteric associations found in his name. The balance between the spiritual and material worlds, the emphasis on the divine wisdom, and the harmony between mind, body, and spirit are all concepts that have significantly impacted contemporary Neo-pagan thought and practice. It is through these key elements that Levi's contributions have resonated deeply within the Neo-pagan tradition, shaping it into the rich and diverse spiritual path it is today.
