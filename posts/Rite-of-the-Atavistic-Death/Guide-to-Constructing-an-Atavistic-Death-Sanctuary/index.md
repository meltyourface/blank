## Consecrating the Atavistic Death - A Guide to Constructing a Ritualistic Sanctuary

**Introduction**:
The Rite of the Atavistic Death is an ancient and arcane art, requiring mastery in both the manipulation of shadowy energies and employment of intricate rituals. The purpose of this manual is to provide practitioners with a comprehensive guide to constructing a consecrated sanctuary or sacrificial altar, ultimately allowing them to perform the Rite to its utmost efficacy. This manual delineates the selection of mystical artifacts, incorporation of enigmatic symbols and sigils, as well as the invocation of primordial forces associated with the Rite. Moreover, it illustrates vital preparatory steps required to attune oneself to the otherworldly essence of the Atavistic Death.

### Chapter 1: Selecting the Sacred Site
Choose a secluded location, shrouded in tranquility and mystery - be it dense forest, deserted ruins, or a hidden cavern. The site should resonate with the energies of death and rebirth, where the veil between our world and the spirit realm is at its thinnest.

### Chapter 2: Gathering Ritualistic Artifacts
Acquire a variety of esoteric objects that emit powerful energies, essential for the potency of this rite, including:
a) An obsidian athame, for etching sigils and severing etheric cords;
b) The skull of a revered ancestor or wise one, to serve as a conduit for primal wisdom;
c) A chalice made of human bone, in which to hold sanctified blood or libations;
d) A runic talisman, imbued with protective energies, safeguarding against malevolence;
e) Censer with incense, combining myrrh, frankincense, and wormwood for spiritual purification;
f) Black candles of beeswax, to summon the shadows.

### Chapter 3: Arranging the Sacred Space
Carefully position the ritualistic artifacts with precision, imbuing them with intent and purpose. The skull must face the North, the athame and chalice together to the East, and the runic talisman to the West. The censer should reside in the center, with candles forming a circle that encloses the entire sanctuary.

### Chapter 4: Drawing Sigils and Symbols
Adorn your sacred space with austere symbols of the Rite of the Atavistic Death. Upon the surface of the altar, inscribe the Sigil of Mortifer, an emblem connecting the living to the realm of spirits. The walls should bear an intricate network of occult runes and glyphs, each pulsating with potency and purpose.

### Chapter 5: Invocation of Archetypal Energies
Silence the chattering mind and attune oneself to the natural rhythms of the environment. Beseech the ancient forces resonating with the Rite of the Atavistic Death. Summon the primordial spirits of necromancy, offering the chalice filled with libations or blood, as tribute and sustenance.

### Chapter 6: Preparation and Attunement
In solitude, fast for three days to purge oneself of impurities. Meditate upon the inevitability of death and the depthless cycles of rebirth. Immerse oneself in the words of time-honored texts and explore the subconscious through dreams and trances.

### Chapter 7: Purification and Sanctification
To cleanse the sacred space, cast a circle with a purified salt mixture, encompassing the entire sanctuary. Perform the Ritual of Shadows to dispel malevolent entities. Light the black candles, reciting powerful incantations to imbue the space with protection and renew the primordial energies of the Atavistic Death.

**Conclusion**:
This manual provides a systematic, in-depth guide to constructing a consecrated sanctuary or sacrificial altar. It encompasses the selection and arrangement of occult artifacts, the incorporation of enigmatic symbols, and the invocation of archaic energies. Ultimately, it enables the practitioner to master the Rite of the Atavistic Death, reaching beyond the mortal plane and delving into the mysteries of life, death, and rebirth.
