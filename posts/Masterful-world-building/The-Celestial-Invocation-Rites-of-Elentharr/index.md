1. The Lore and Cosmology of the World

In the vast, immersive world of Elentharr, there exists the powerful pantheon of celestial beings known as The Eterna. **The Eterna are divided into three primary tiers**: 

a. **The Ruling Triumvirate**: Supreme beings governing creation, balance, and destruction—Eolaris (creation), Ozymab (balance), and Intheris (destruction).
b. **The Ethereal Court**: Twelve celestial entities who preside over various aspects of the mortal realms, phenomena, and emotions.
c. **The Celestial Choir**: Countless lesser spirits and elemental forces who aid The Ethereal Court in maintaining the stability of Elentharr. 

2. The Magical System

The magic system in Elentharr is built on the manipulation of the mystical energy known as Celestial Essence. The Celestial Essence forms connections and commands with the divine powers of The Eterna. It permeates the world and binds all living beings, inanimate objects, and even intangible concepts together. Historically, the study and application of Celestial Essence have evolved over thousands of years, expanding from the cradle of the First Magi of Elentharr, who tapped into the energy flows using sacred words. Over time, the discipline diversified into different branches and magical societies, with their specific practices and incantations. 

3. Components of the Invocation Ritual

The invocation of celestial entities requires a deep understanding of the intricate complexities within the Celestial Essence and an array of sacred tools and materials:

a. The Sacred Text of Eterna, an ancient tome providing knowledge on the invocation rites, phrases, and connections to the pantheon.
b. The Orb of Celestial Channels, a mysterious artifact that can focus the energies emanating from celestial bodies to form divine connections.
c. Symbols of the pantheon drawn with consecrated dust (derived from the ground remains of divine crystals) to signify the particular celestial being one wishes to invoke.
d. The Robes of Invocation embedded with precious gems and intricate embroidery, each symbolizing different celestial beings and their domains.
e. The Chalice of Profound Devotion, a goblet containing a blend of rare herbs, sacred waters, and the invoker's blood, symbolizing their commitment to the invoked celestial entity.

4. The Ritual Process

To perform the invocation rite, the invoker must follow these precise steps:

a. The ritual must take place during a new moon, signaling the birth of new energies and opportunities.
b. The invoker must be in a sanctum, a dedicated space with precise astronomical alignments and—where possible—an open view to the celestial bodies.
c. The invoker starts the ritual by donning the Robes of Invocation and consuming the contents of the Chalice of Profound Devotion.
d. The invoker, armed with the Sacred Text of Eterna, lays out the consecrated dust symbols, activating them by reciting phrases from the text.
e. Lighting ceremonial incense and positioning the Orb of Celestial Channels in the center of the sanctum, the invoker begins to chant the incantations and perform the specific physical movements outlined in the Sacred Text of Eterna.

5. Risks, Rewards, and Consequences

Invoking celestial entities from The Eterna is fraught with risks and potential rewards, impacting the individual and the world at large. Successful invocation could grant the invoker divine favors, arcane knowledge, or miraculous powers. However, improper preparation or impure intentions may attract wrath and punishment from the invoked celestial being, ranging from severe mental anguish to physical harm or oblivion.

The broader narrative of Elentharr continues to evolve, with the consequences of these celestial invocations shaping the precarious balance between chaos and order. The outcomes of these mystical rites may ripple throughout the world, resulting in wars, alliances, or the awakening of ancient and unknown forces yet to reveal themselves in the sprawling and wondrous world of Elentharr.
