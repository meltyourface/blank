description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Sacrifice, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Compose a profoundly evocative soliloquy, uttered in a hushed tone by a tormented Aztec high priest who, amidst the grandiosity of a sacrificial ceremony, delves into a heart-wrenching exploration of the moral implications of their current practices. Let the priest question the legitimacy of tradition, wrestle with the balance between appeasing the gods and preserving human lives, and reflect upon the unforeseen consequences that might be incurred as a result of perpetuating the sacrificial customs. Make the soliloquy replete with vivid imagery of blood-streaked temples and beaten hearts, alluding to the dark nature of sacrifice, while also instilling an undercurrent of crippling doubt that threatens to shatter the foundations of the Aztec empire.

Beneath the almighty sun, amidst the clamor of this ancient rite, its skies yet host to a splendor the likes of which cannot be subdued, I beseech thee, dreadful Quetzalcoatl. Bear witness to the echoes of my lamentations; harken thy countenance to the murmurings of a tortured heart. Canst thou hear it? This lowly whisper escapes from the altar of crimson stones, where the blood of the chosen doth flow like rivers of anguish. Does its sustenance appease the divine throats of you, O great Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli? Or do you hear only the cries of mortal woe?

For what purpose was this venerated arrangement conceived, handed down from generation to generation? Upon what pedestal of eternal honor do we rest the sanctity of our destiny and our allegiance to the Spirit? To dance and sing amidst the bounties of nature, heartily bestowing blessings upon shepherds and farmers alike, we bear witness to that which is no longer our choice, but a yoke that binds soul upon soul.

Stand I within a chasm of immaterial angst, I beg of you, grant reprieve to this solemn heart! Lend your voice, if only once, to alleviate the torment that deranges a once-devout servant. Your silence ravages the sanctum of my spirit, filling its halls with a thick darkness that cannot be scoured by sacrificial offerings.

Question I now, these rites and rituals ingrained within the very fabric of this boundless empire – are they the fruits of divine decree, or the machinations of mortal men? To slaughter in the name of the gods: are we delivering fragrant incense to the throats of heaven, or do we condemn ourselves to bear the burden of endless sorrow? How many hearts must be torn and rendered asunder before the divine scales find balance and grant our survival?

Ah, yet doubts fester like shadows in the recesses of the temple, eroding the very foundation we have built upon the corpses of our brethren. In clouds of incense and ritual smoke, questions begat questions, offering no redeeming respite or answers; the cycle unbroken. Can one, in earnest conscience, silence the whispers that fracture an already fractured soul?

Mightier than jaguars, yet affording a less merciful bite, these truths tear the flesh of the empire as it lies shackled within bars of ignorance. The cries of the fallen echo like relentless drumbeats against the walls of my slumber; will no dawn arrive to ally with the silence? The sun rises and sets, not dispensing its blinding light to lead the way out of this labyrinthine guilt.

O glorious Tezcatlipoca, hearken unto me, your loyal servant, who trembles beneath the weight of a thousand sacrificed souls, seeking solace that may never come! If the answer is to be found within the cloister of my heart – the culmination of all this torment – purge me, and cast me into the darkness of the sacrificial pit, that bone and blood may adorn the key to our everlasting salvation.
