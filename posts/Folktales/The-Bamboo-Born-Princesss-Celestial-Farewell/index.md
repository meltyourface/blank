Folktale: The Bamboo Princess (竹取物語, Taketori Monogatari) - 10th century, Japan

Original summary:

In ancient Japan, an old man finds a shining stalk of bamboo and discovers a tiny baby inside. He and his wife, having no children of their own, raise the girl as their daughter. Over time, she grows into a radiant young woman and attracts the attention of royal suitors. She never falls in love with any of them, and gives them impossible tasks to discourage them. When one suitor dies attempting a task, the girl is heartbroken and reveals she is from the moon, and must return someday. Eventually, heavenly beings come to take the princess back to the moon and she says farewell to her earthly parents.

Modernized Rendition:

Once upon a time in rural Japan, an elderly bamboo cutter named Takahashi was scrolling through his smartphone when he stumbled upon an Instagram post of a glowing, majestic bamboo stalk. Drawn by the mesmerizing image, Takahashi ventured into the forest and found the bamboo stalk from the post. To his astonishment, he discovered a small, shining baby girl inside the bamboo.

Takahashi and his wife Yumi, who had long wished for a child, decided to raise the baby as their own. They named her Hikari, which means light, for her incredible glow. Hikari grew up to be a captivating, beautiful young woman with perhaps the most influential Twitter account in all of Japan.

As her fame grew, many affluent suitors emerged, hoping to win Hikari's affection. Among them were Elon Musk, the tech mogul, and a popular musician known as Lil Jon. But Hikari never truly fell in love.

To discourage her suitors, she gave each of them seemingly impossible tasks to impress her with. Elon was to create a flying car, and Lil Jon was asked to compose a song that conveyed the profundity of life without using his trademark phrases.

During this time, Hikari grew increasingly fond of Neil Armstrong, a retired astronaut she'd met online. They shared long conversations about space, and Hikari found herself attached to him. But one day, she received news of his passing and was consumed with grief.

In the depth of her sorrow, Hikari confessed to her earthly parents that she was a celestial being from the moon. She had been sent to Earth to experience life on the planet, but knew she would need to return someday. As tears streamed down her face, she told them that the time for her return was upon her.

No sooner had Hikari revealed her truth that an angelic celestial entourage appeared before them. Though it broke her heart into a million shimmering pieces, Hikari bid farewell to Takahashi and Yumi, the wonderful souls who had loved her as their own.

Ascending to the heavens, Hikari looked back upon her past life on Earth – the friendships she had made, the beauty she had encountered, and the family she would forever cherish. It was then that she fully understood the bittersweet essence of the human experience: that love’s brilliance was mingled with the inescapable loss endured by all.

Embraced once more by the glowing moon above, Hikari dedicated herself to guiding those who struggled in the darkness below. For she was bound to the Earth by a love that transcended time and space, and an eternal promise to remain a beacon of hope for the lost souls traversing the mysteries of life.
