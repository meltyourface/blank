Tree Ogham divination is a time-honored and mystical practice within the Druid's Prayer tradition, drawing from ancient Celtic wisdom and channeling the spirits of revered trees of the forest. Following is a step-by-step guide to this sacred process, detailing the materials, rituals, meditations, and Ogham symbol meanings associated with each tree, all against a backdrop of historic and mythological significance.

Materials:
1. Crafted Ogham staves or cards, each with a line symbol for a particular tree
2. Cloth to spread the staves or cards
3. Notebook to record observations and insights
4. **Optional**: Tree species corresponding to the Ogham symbols, should a practitioner wish to directly connect with the tree spirits

Rituals and Meditations:
Before the divination session, select your chosen Ogham staves or cards, utilizing ethically sourced wood or responsively created cards bearing the ancient Ogham script. Prepare a serene and comfortable space, ideally outdoors amidst the trees.

1. Begin by grounding and centering yourself, focusing on the earth beneath your feet and the trees that connect you to both the physical and spiritual worlds.
2. Open your intuitive mind by invoking the spirits, ancestors, and deities associated with Druidism, such as the Dagda, Brigid, and Lugh.
3. Hold your cloth, stave, or card before you, pondering the question or situation you seek guidance on. Close your eyes, center your thoughts, and take a deep breath.
4. Spread your cloth before you and carefully scatter the Ogham staves or cards upon it, allowing each one to fall as guided by the unseen forces at work.
5. Observe the Ogham symbols and the direction in which they fell. Consider the meaning each symbol holds and the message it imparts.

Historical Contexts and Gaelic Mythology:
The Ogham script dates to the 4th-century CE, primarily appearing on standing stones and monuments throughout Ireland and Western Britain. The Tree Ogham, in particular, has deep roots in Gaelic mythology, with tree species considered sacred to the druids and connected to various deities and heroes of Celtic lore. Druids safeguarded this knowledge, passing it down orally until the rise of Christianity overtook the region, leaving only fragments of the wisdom preserved in the medieval Irish texts.

Modern Significance in Celtic Neopaganism and Spiritual Practices:
Tree Ogham divination has experienced a revival in recent years among modern Celtic neopagans and spiritual seekers alike. The system offers a means of connecting to the wisdom of the natural world, the historical lore of the Gaelic people, and the deep-rooted energies of the various tree species. Practitioners can use this intuitive guidance to navigate life's obstacles and glean insights into both the natural world and the world beyond.

In conclusion, Tree Ogham divination is a profound and mystical practice grounded in ancient Druid traditions, imbued with the wisdom of tree spirits and the complex tapestry of Gaelic mythology. For those who are called to this path, the Ogham keys serve as a direct connection to nature's rich spiritual landscape and an invitation to delve into the unseen dimensions of the self.
