excerpt: > 
  Write a comprehensive plan on how to conduct a historical archive search, concentrating on the practice of Witch pricking during 16th-century European Witch trials. This plan should include the identification of primary sources, such as inquisition records, trial transcripts, and firsthand accounts, and the examination of secondary sources, like scholarly works and historical analyses. Develop a structured methodology to accurately compare and contrast the variations in Witch pricking methods used across different European regions, and analyze the social, political, and religious factors influencing these practices. Additionally, outline the steps for evaluating the credibility of sources and provide examples of potential biases, inaccuracies, or misinformation present in the historical documents.
