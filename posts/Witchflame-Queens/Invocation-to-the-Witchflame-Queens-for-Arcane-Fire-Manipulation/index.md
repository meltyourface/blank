In the shadows of forgotten eons, where ethereal whispers dance with the wind, I call upon the omnipotent and venerable Witchflame Queens! Mighty sovereigns of arcane fire, hear my plea and heed my call!
 
Eminent Queen Myrvala, weaver of the scarlet tapestry, conduit of the burning celestial tapestry, lend me your immutable wisdom! Illuminate my path with the vital glow of your boundless intellect, and let it sear away the veil of ignorance that shrouds the truth.

All-seeing Queen Zylphia, guardian of eternal flames, mistress of the crimson conflagration that scorches the fabric of reality, bequeath upon me your expansive knowledge of fire manipulation. Let it forge in me the capacity to mold and command the fervent tongues of the arcane inferno.

Exalted Queens, revered paragons of the hallowed Witchflame secrets, before your majestic presence I humbly bow. With invocations ancient as the stars above and sacred as the earth below, I summon your universal power:
 
*"Eteleth Cruato Myrval'a Zylphi'ora!"*
 
As above, so below, allow me to become the vessel for your transcendent guidance. Inscribe upon my soul the incandescent runes of your legacy, lighting the path into the astral depths of the unknown.
 
*"Nomir Zeigon Veylock Fyr-thol'a!"*
 
By the crackling embers of twilight and the incandescent glow of dawn, eternal fire within my spirit burns, yearning for the unfathomable tapestry of your mystic artistry. As I gaze into the blazing abyss of time and space, the talons of shadow cling tightly, but with your luminous presence, they shall unclasp.

*"Karvala Drael'zeth Ontor Witchfla'viath!"*

Glorious Queen Myrvala and Queen Zylphia, the eternal masters of Witchflame, I invoke thee with fervent devotion and unwavering desire. With your divine essence intertwined, illuminate the path to the deepest mysteries of your preeminent domain.

Upon this invocation's final breath, I beseech your radiant spirits to converge, granting me the strength to surmount the arcane endeavors of crimson fire manipulation and primeval enlightenment.

*"Azgoren Vala'thyrak Witchflame Reja'sig!"*

So mote it be!
