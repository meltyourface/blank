To create an intricate mystic sigil for the Dragon Witchflame Prince that spiritually synchronizes with his potent aura, fiery elemental prowess, ancient draconic wisdom, and realm-shifting capabilities borne from his witchflame lineage, we must delve into the intricate symbolism of arcane dragon runes and explore the depths of his tempestuous ethereal connection.

The sigil begins with the central symbol of the Dragon's Eye, representing the all-seeing wisdom and piercing gaze of the Dragon Witchflame Prince. This eye is encircled by three overlapping circles, symbolizing the unity of fire, air, and spirit – the primary elements incorporated in his witchflame lineage.

Next, the sigil bears four intertwining dragon forms, each with various distinct features. These dragon forms represent the deep connection to the four directions, as well as the cardinal elements present in the realm. They are positioned in a circular pattern around the central Dragon's Eye.

The first dragon represents the element of fire, depicted with vivid flames curling from its scales and nostrils. Its tail entwines with the second dragon, which is associated with air – signified by feathery wings and swirling mists surrounding its body.

The third dragon represents the element of earth, its body covered in dense foliage and stones, while its tail coils around the fourth dragon, which represents water. This final dragon is adorned with fluid, undulating scales and surrounded by flowing waves and currents.

Between each of the four intertwining dragons, arcane dragon runes are carved into the sigil's surface, imbuing the emblem with additional mystical properties and protection. These runes stand for Draconic power, sorcerous knowledge, elemental mastery, and spiritual transcendence - key traits that pertain to the Dragon Witchflame Prince.

Finally, to anchor the sigil's mystic energies and strengthen the magic conduit between the talisman and the Dragon Witchflame Prince, a series of interlocking pentagram shapes encases the entire design. These outer pentagrams symbolize the unity of all elements and the potent spiritual power that empowers the talisman and allows it to harmonize with the Prince's multifaceted energy.

With this intricate spiritual sigil, the Talisman of the Dragon Witchflame Prince synchronizes with the ancient prowess and mysteries of the Prince, providing a powerful connection to his overwhelming presence in the ethereal realms.
