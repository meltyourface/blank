Answer:

To fully grasp the connection between ancient Dutch vampire lore, their feeding habits, preferred environment, and the Dutch Golden Age, we must first explore the context of the Dutch Golden Age, the key aspects of Dutch culture and economic development, and the patterns of vampire feeding habits and preferences in ancient Dutch lore.

The Dutch Golden Age was a remarkable period in European history, spanning the 17th century, during which the Dutch Republic became a vibrant center of trade, art, and scientific discovery. This period saw rapid economic growth, a thriving merchant class, the establishment of the Dutch East India Company, the rise of great Dutch artists like Rembrandt and Vermeer, and advances in science and technology.

In ancient Dutch vampire lore, vampires were nocturnal and elusive creatures that fed on the blood of living beings, often selecting victims who were young and healthy to sustain their strength and vitality. In terms of preferred environment, Dutch vampires liked to live in urban areas, which allowed them to blend in among the human population and afforded them ample feeding opportunities.

Now, the key aspect of Dutch cultural and economic development during the Dutch Golden Age that became integral to the vampires' survival was the booming trade and the consequent prosperity of the merchant class. This economic prosperity led to the construction of elaborate, well-connected networks of canals and the development of densely populated urban centers, such as Amsterdam, where the vampires could easily find their prey and remain concealed from the general populace.

The expansive maze-like canals provided an ideal environment for the vampires to lurk, as they could swiftly navigate between their lairs and their hunting grounds under the cover of darkness, undetected by humans. Additionally, the bustling markets and crowded streets meant that vampires could more easily find their victims without arousing suspicion.

The Dutch Golden Age also gave rise to a surge of intellectual curiosity and scientific inquiry. Societal views on the supernatural and occult took on more complex and varied dimensions as the population grew more literate and educated. Interestingly, the prominence of the arts during this period also played a role in shaping these views. Depictions of supernatural beings and occult themes appeared frequently in the works of Dutch painters and writers, reflecting the inescapable influence of myth and folklore on the collective imagination.

However, the immense wealth that accumulated in the hands of the merchant class also contributed to an increasingly decadent and debauched lifestyle, which traditional religious authorities disapproved of. As a result, the societal view of the supernatural and occult became more closely linked to moral and social decline. 

This connection between wealth and decadence, combined with the fear of nocturnal, blood-sucking creatures, might have inadvertently served as a metaphor for the anxieties over the consequences of acquired wealth and the abandonment of traditional virtues. Vampires embodied the dark side of the societal transformation that occurred during the Dutch Golden Age, exemplifying the fears that were nestled into the hearts and minds of the people at the time.

In conclusion, the key aspect of Dutch cultural and economic development that became integral to the survival of ancient Dutch vampires during the Dutch Golden Age was the prosperous trade and urbanization. The resulting complex canal systems and densely populated urban centers provided an ideal environment for the vampires to hide and hunt. The era also affected societal views on the supernatural and occult, with the growing influence of the arts and scientific inquiry that created a complex relationship between wealth, decadence, and moral decline, with vampires standing as metaphors for these concerns.
