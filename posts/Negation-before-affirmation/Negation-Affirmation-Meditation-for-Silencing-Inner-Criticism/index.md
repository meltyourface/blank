## Title: Silencing the Inner Critic: Negation Before Affirmation Meditation
**Step 1**: Prepare the Environment
Choose a quiet and calm space where you feel secure and won't be disturbed. The environment should be clutter-free and have a comfortable position for sitting or lying down. Consider lighting candles or incense to create a soothing atmosphere. Dim the lights to promote relaxation.
**Step 2**: Posture and Breathing
Assume a comfortable position either sitting or lying down, ensuring your spine is straight and aligned. Close your eyes and relax your body. Focus on your breath, taking deep inhales through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Establish a slow, rhythmic breathing pattern.
**Step 3**: Visualization of the Negation Sigil
Begin the visualization process by picturing a vast, empty space representing your mind in its natural state of peace and clarity. In the center of this space, imagine a complex sigil imbued with the power to negate the negative thoughts and self-doubt that plague your mind. This sigil should be intricate, weaving negative symbols into a coherent structure, allowing you to focus on the specific negative aspects you want to remove.
**Step 4**: Mantra of Negation
As you maintain the visualization of the negation sigil, start reciting a complex mantra that embodies the negation process. The mantra should consist of words and phrases that represent the purification and nullification of self-doubt, inner criticism, and any limiting beliefs. Repeat this mantra aloud or silently, weaving it into your breathing pattern.

**Sample mantra**: "Aham Nirvikalpaam, Mukta Bandhanam, Swaha"
**Step 5**: Dissolving the Negation Sigil
Visualize the negation sigil being dissolved by the power of your mantra, the negative aspects vanishing as the sigil disintegrates. Allow the negation to occur slowly and thoroughly, symbolizing the release of limiting beliefs and self-doubt from your psyche. 
**Step 6**: Constructing the Affirmation Sigil
Upon the dissolution of the negation sigil, begin constructing an intricate mental sigil representing self-love and positive convictions. This sigil should be unique and personally meaningful, incorporating symbols, images, and patterns that hold emotional significance to you.
**Step 7**: Mantra of Affirmation
Recite a complex mantra that reflects your internal transformation. The mantra should manifest self-love, self-acceptance, and positive intentions. Repeat this mantra aloud or silently, weaving it into your breathing pattern.

**Sample mantra**: "Aham Prema, Aham Shakti, Aham Brahmasmi"
**Step 8**: Infusing Your Psyche with the Affirmation Sigil
As you continue to recite the affirmation mantra, envision the sigil of self-love radiating with the bright light of positive energy and penetrating deep into your psyche. Visualize the light merging with your true self, filling every corner of your mind and heart with affirmative intentions.
**Step 9**: Completing the Meditation
Bring your attention back to your breath, and take a series of deep, cleansing breaths. As you exhale, release any lingering negative energy. Gently open your eyes and take a moment to bask in the feelings of self-love and renewed positivity.
**Step 10**: Practice Consistently
Incorporate this esoteric meditation practice into your daily routine. Regular practice will ensure that the inner critic remains silenced while positive convictions take root and flourish.

Final Thoughts:
This esoteric meditation practice, grounded in negation before affirmation, will guide you in silencing your inner critic and fostering positive convictions. Visualization and mantra recitation are crucial in this process and the more elaborate your sigil and mantras are, the stronger the effect. The consistency of practice, suitable environment, proper posture, and breathing techniques will optimize your results and lead to a balanced and affirmative state of being.
