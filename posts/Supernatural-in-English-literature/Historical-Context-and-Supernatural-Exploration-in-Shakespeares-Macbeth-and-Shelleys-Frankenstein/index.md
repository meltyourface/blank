To delve into the representation of supernatural beings and elements in Shakespeare's "Macbeth" and Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," it is necessary to analyze these works within the historical context of their respective time periods. These distinct eras harbored unique beliefs, social structures, and moral values that shaped the portrayal of supernatural entities and their relationship with the natural world. Furthermore, analyzing how these works challenge or reinforce our understanding of the esoteric and its interplay with the natural world will provide deeper insights into their impact on society.

Shakespeare's "Macbeth" is a product of the Elizabethan era, characterized by a strong belief in the supernatural, particularly witchcraft and omens. This was institutionalized by the monarchy, as seen in King James I's involvement in witch trials and his treatise on demonology. In this society, the supernatural was often considered as capable of corrupting the natural order, generating fear and anxiety in the masses.

In "Macbeth," the presence of the three witches is a significant manifestation of the supernatural. Their prophecies set Macbeth on a tragic path driven by ambition and betrayal, reflecting societal anxieties about the corrupting influence of the occult on individuals. Moreover, the play also exhibits supernatural elements in the form of apparitions and omens, such as the ghost of Banquo and the bloody hands that Lady Macbeth perceives, underscoring the power and malevolence of otherworldly forces.

Turning to Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," the novel was written during the Romantic period, a time that favored the exploration of human emotions, nature, and the ephemeral. Shelley's contemporaries were preoccupied with understanding the boundaries between the natural and supernatural, due in part to significant scientific advancements and feats, such as the studies in electricity and galvanism. This fascination drove humankind's desire to challenge the limits of their knowledge, treading into the realm of the esoteric.

"Frankenstein" follows Victor Frankenstein's attempt to create life using scientific methodsâ€”a process normally reserved for divine beings. This transgression blurs the line between the natural and supernatural, evoking anxieties surrounding humanity's growing technological capabilities and the potential pitfalls that may arise from playing God. The novel reflects its time period, where questions of morality and the implications of advanced science prompted society to confront limits.

In conclusion, the supernatural beings and elements in Shakespeare's "Macbeth" and Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" distinctly reflect societal anxieties, beliefs, and moral values of their respective time periods. "Macbeth" exhibits how the Elizabethan era viewed the supernatural as a malevolent, corrupting force capable of wreaking havoc on the natural order. Contrarily, "Frankenstein" showcases how the Romantic period grappled with the growing intersection of natural and supernatural forces, as technology and science threatened to overrun humanity's ethical boundaries. Thus, both works serve as crucial pieces of literature which challenge and reinforce our understanding of the interplay between the esoteric and the natural world.
