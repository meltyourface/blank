Tarot Card: The Hermit

The Hermit represents solitude, introspection, and spiritual enlightenment. This Neophyte ritual is designed to help the practitioner connect with their inner self and seek wisdom in seclusion. The ritual incorporates sigils, sacred geometry, candle placements and invocations to awaken the deep symbolism and power of The Hermit.

Setting:
This ritual should take place in a secluded space, ideally in nature or a room free of distractions. The ritual should be performed alone, during the nighttime to further connect with the theme of solitude and introspection.

Required Items:
1. A large, clean cloth (preferably white) to sit on during the ritual
2. The Hermit Tarot card
3. Seven white candles
4. Incense (sandalwood or frankincense)
5. Pen and paper
6. Sigil representing The Hermit (created beforehand)
7. Chalk or a string to draw a circle

Ritual Preparation:
1. Begin by cleansing the area and yourself. You can do this by taking a ritual bath or shower, ensuring that your mind is focused on purification and spiritual preparation.
2. Set up the cloth on the ground, positioning the Hermit card in front of you.
3. Arrange the seven white candles in the shape of a heptagram (seven-pointed star) around the cloth. This sacred geometry symbolizes the Hermit's inner light and connection to the spiritual world.
4. Use chalk or a string to draw a circle around the candles. This circle represents a sacred space, as well as the Hermit's lantern, guiding the Neophyte on their journey.
5. Light the incense and let the smoke cleanse the area.

Ritual Execution:
1. Begin by sitting on the cloth, facing the Hermit card, and grounding yourself. Take slow, deep breaths and focus your mind on the purpose of the ritual.
2. Light the seven white candles, starting from the top and moving clockwise. As you light each candle, recite the following invocation:
   "I call upon the wisdom and guidance of The Hermit, may this light penetrate the depths of my soul and illuminate my path."
3. Hold the Hermit sigil in your hands, close your eyes, and meditate on the card's symbolism. Focus on introspection, spiritual growth, and guidance.
4. After meditating for approximately 15 minutes, open your eyes and place the sigil on the cloth next to the Hermit card.
5. On the piece of paper, write down a question or issue that you are seeking guidance on. Be specific and concise.
6. Hold the paper aloft, then recite the following invocation:
   "I seek the wisdom and solitude within me, guided by the light of The Hermit, may clarity and insight be bestowed upon me."
7. Fold the paper and place it under the Hermit card. Leave it there for the remainder of the ritual.
8. Close your eyes and meditate once more. Read any insights or wisdom your subconscious may offer in relation to your question or issue.
9. Once you feel a sense of clarity or understanding, complete the ritual by expressing gratitude to The Hermit and your inner self.
   
Closing the Ritual:
1. Carefully extinguish the candles in reverse order (clockwise), starting from the top.
2. Thank the Hermit for the guidance provided.
3. Open the circle by erasing or removing the chalk or string.
4. Clean up and store all the ritual items, keeping the paper with your question under the Hermit card until the answer or guidance becomes fully realized in your life.

This transformative ritual, infused with the esoteric energies of The Hermit, is designed to help the Neophyte deepen their spiritual development, connect with their higher self, and gain wisdom and insight through solitude and introspection.
