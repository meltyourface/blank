description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Desperation, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a dark and haunting poem that evokes a sense of desperation, utilizing the mystical knowledge of Qabalistic numerology. Delve into the intricacies of the Tree of Life, Sephiroth, and their corresponding numerical values. Incorporate the numbers 3, 5, and 8 as they hold particular significance within the realm of desperation, forming the foundation of your poem. Experiment with the juxtaposition of light and shadow by weaving Da'ath, the hidden Sephirah, into your words, thus enriching the poem's symbolic depth and complexity.

In tenebris of Da'ath, shadows whisper veilèd truths,
I tread a path forsaken, through murky depths construed.
A Threefold flame of Desperation mounts, the night intrudes;
Five petals bloom in darkness, amid occultic broods.

Sephirotic spectres materialize— a ghastly sight!
Abyssal daemons haunting, souls of yore recite.
Emanaté from Three a sense of strife and deep despair,
This number births the captive's wail, upon the midnight air.

Quintessence unearths in Five, concealed within the tomb,
Devouring the fleeting solace, within the heart consumed.
Da'ath eclipses the shimmering splendour of Kether's crown,
Drags the luminous pathway to malms of forlorn I've found.

The screech of Eight resounds within, Chokhmah's grasp sublime;
Serpent writhes in mystic form, ciphers stalking like a crime.
With clamouring throngs of spectres, in shadowed depths does hide,
Their unrelenting yearning for release to life denied.

By hands unseen, the Sefer Yetzirah's ink did fade,
Its letters lost in time, on parchment's tear they played.
In secrecy, the text inscribed in desperation's thrall,
A testament of darkness in these haunted hallowed halls.

Lo! A symphony of spectral cries, cacophonic and complete!
Unbind thine chains of earthbound plight, to higher worlds retreat.
Upon the ash-kissed corners of the Tree of Life, they climb—
Emissaries of the Sephiroth, in search of truths divine.

Now, entwined within the tenebrous embrace of Da'ath,
I conjure forth the chaos of Three, Five, and Eight enwrapped.
To harness the eternal power of Qabalistic lore,
And alchemize the shadows, transcending evermore!
