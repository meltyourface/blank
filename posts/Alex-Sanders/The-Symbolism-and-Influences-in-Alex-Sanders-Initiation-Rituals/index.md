To fully understand and respond to the knowledge challenge, we must first provide some foundational context in regard to Alex Sanders and the core elements mentioned: Alexandrian Wicca, ceremonial magic, Qabalah, and the Tree of Life. 

Alexander Sanders (1926-1988) was an influential figure in the modern witchcraft revival movement and the founder of the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca. Alexandrian Wicca is a syncretic tradition that incorporates aspects of ceremonial magic, the Qabalah, and traditional British witchcraft as taught by Gerald Gardner. In many ways, Alexandrian Wicca differs from Gardnerian Wicca in its emphasis on incorporating more ceremonial magic and Qabalistic influences. 

Ceremonial magic is a broad term referring to various practices and rituals mostly designed to invoke or communicate with spiritual beings, such as angels or spirits. The Qabalah is a mystical Jewish tradition that explores the nature of divinity and creation through a symbolic and geometric framework, primarily through the use of the Tree of Life, a diagrammatic representation of the 10 aspects of the Creator, referred to as sephiroth, and the 22 paths that connect them.

Now that we understand the basic context, we can begin to discuss the symbolism and names used within Alex Sanders' initiation rituals in relation to the Tree of Life and the interconnectedness of his various influences.

The initiation rituals within Alexandrian Wicca have deep connections to the symbolism of the Tree of Life. From the use of god and goddess names that correspond to specific sephiroth to the utilization of ritual tools that represent the four Kabbalistic worlds, the integration of Qabalistic symbolism is evident. By combining the elements of the Qabalah and ceremonial magic with traditional witchcraft, Sanders sought to create a system that enabled initiates to explore and understand their spirituality more fully.

For instance, the initiation circle is designed to represent the manifestation of the entire Tree of Life within a sacred space marked by the practitioner. The circle is divided into four quarters, with each quarter aligning with one of the four Kabbalistic worlds: Atziluth (archetypal), Beriah (creative), Yetzirah (formative), and Assiah (material).

Within this complexity, each initiatory degree connects to different sephiroth on the Tree of Life and mirrors the aspirant's spiritual journey. The first-degree initiation focuses on the aspirant's connection to the material world, relating to the sephiroth of Malkuth (Kingdom). Through this degree, the initiate learns how to navigate the world, developing their spiritual practice and their connection to the divine.

In the second-degree initiation, the aspirant progresses along the Tree of Life, connecting to the sephiroth of Yesod (Foundation), Hod (Splendor), and Netzach (Victory), which represents the astral realm. The initiate here delves into the deeper mysteries of their spiritual practice and develops skills in astral work and divination.

The third-degree initiation brings the aspirant to the sephiroth of Tiphereth (Beauty), symbolizing spiritual attainment and the balancing of opposites. This degree is traditionally associated with the role of high priest or high priestess and represents the marriage of the divine feminine and masculine energies within the practitioner.

During each of these rites, the prominence of ceremonial magic is reflected through the use of tools, including the wand, athame, chalice, and pentacle, which represent the four elements and the four Kabbalistic worlds. The invocations and rituals aim to evoke energy from the Tree of Life and channel it into the sphere of the aspirant, as well as honoring and invoking entities corresponding to the Tree of Life, such as archangels and gods.

In summary, Alexandrian Wicca steeply incorporates the symbolism and names used within its initiation rituals to relate to the Tree of Life. Alex Sanders' profound affinity for ceremonial magic and Qabalah shaped the tradition by incorporating these influences into the core of its initiatory rites. The interconnectedness of these influences is observed through the Tree of Life's sacred geometry, sephiroth associations, and nuanced approaches to spiritual progression. This unique blend epitomizes the eclectic and dynamic nature of Alexandrian Wicca.
