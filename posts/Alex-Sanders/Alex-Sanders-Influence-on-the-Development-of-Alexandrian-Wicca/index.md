To answer this knowledge challenge, it is crucial to first understand the personal experiences and influences of Alex Sanders' upbringing, the esoteric concepts of the time, the development of the Alexandrian tradition, and how these elements come together in the practice and ethics of modern-day initiates. 

Alex Sanders, often referred to as "King of the Witches," was born in 1926 in Manchester, England. His upbringing was characterized by a strict Roman Catholic environment, which instilled in him a strong belief in the supernatural. Sanders claimed that his interest in witchcraft was sparked at a young age when he discovered a book on the subject in the attic of his grandmother's house. This revelation, combined with a challenging early life, compelled him to delve into the world of witchcraft and the occult, where he found solace, empowerment, and eventually, purpose.

The esoteric concepts prevalent during Sanders' lifetime were a melting pot of occultism, spirituality, and mysticism, infused with a healthy dose of secret societies and mystery teachings. This milieu was further shaped by prevailing religious and philosophical thought, as well as movements like Theosophy and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. As these esoteric concepts evolved and intermingled over time, they greatly influenced the foundations of contemporary witchcraft.

Against this complex backdrop, Alex Sanders, alongside his wife Maxine, was instrumental in the development of the Alexandrian tradition. This tradition grew out of influences from Wicca – specifically Gardnerian Wicca – as well as elements of Ceremonial Magick, Kabbalah, and Egyptian mythology. By incorporating aspects of ceremonial magick and esotericism into the practice of witchcraft, Sanders aimed to synthesize his personal experiences and influences, thereby forming a coherent and identifiable path that would later be known as Alexandrian Wicca.

This unique convergence of influences and concepts can be seen in several key elements of Alexandrian practice. For instance, the use of ritual tools, like the athame (ritual dagger) and chalice, demonstrates the incorporation of ceremonial magick and symbolism into witchcraft. Additionally, Alexandrian rituals often involve the casting of a circle and the invocation of spiritual entities, which draws from both ceremonial magick and traditional witchcraft practices.

Another manifestation of this synthesis between personal experience and esoteric concepts lies in the ethical principles of Alexandrian Wicca. In particular, the emphasis on discipline, responsibility, and self-mastery can be traced back to Sanders' difficult childhood and strict Catholic upbringing. Furthermore, the core principle of Alexandrian Wicca—'Do what thou wilt, but harm none'— echoes Sanders' desire to create a practice that empowers individuals without compromising their ethical integrity.

In summary, the key themes in this exploration are:

1. Alex Sanders' upbringing forged an early interest in the supernatural and served as the foundation of his future involvement in witchcraft.
2. Esoteric concepts present during Sanders' lifetime encompassed a wide spectrum of occultism, spirituality, and mysticism, which heavily influenced the development of modern witchcraft.
3. Alexandrian tradition – spearheaded by Sanders – combined elements of Wicca, Ceremonial Magick, Kabbalah, and Egyptian mythology, reflecting a culmination of his personal experiences and influences.
4. The practice and ethics of modern-day Alexandrian initiates continue to demonstrate the convergence of these foundational elements, through the use of ritual tools, magickal practice, and a strong ethical code that emphasizes personal responsibility.

In conclusion, the personal experiences and influences of Alex Sanders' upbringing converged with esoteric concepts throughout his life, leading to the development of the Alexandrian tradition. In turn, these foundational elements continue to manifest in the practices and ethics of modern-day initiates, weaving an intricate tapestry of spirituality, self-discipline, and magickal exploration.
