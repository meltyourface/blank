Answer: King of the Witches, Gardnerian Wicca

Explanation:

Alex Sanders (1926â€“1988) was a highly influential figure in the world of modern witchcraft and the Pagan revival that took place in the mid-to-late 20th century. He is most well-known for establishing the Alexandrian Wicca tradition, which is one of the major traditions within the umbrella of Wicca. Sanders was often called "King of the Witches," a title given to him by the press due to his dramatic flair and public persona.

The coven founded by Alex Sanders, known as the Alexandrian coven, claimed lineage from Gardnerian Wicca. Gerald Gardner's work was the basis for modern Wicca, with its structured ritual practices, degrees of initiation, and concepts of polarity and fertility at the center of worship. Gardnerian Wicca itself was inspired by a number of sources, both occult and traditional, such as ceremonial magic, folk magic, and the writings of Margaret Murray. 

Sanders' Alexandrian Wicca tradition built on these Gardnerian foundations, incorporating additional elements from the occult, ceremonial magic, and the Kabbalah. This innovative synthesis contributed significantly to the development and evolution of modern witchcraft as a diverse spiritual practice.

The other options listed in the question are not relevant to Alex Sanders and his contributions to the Alexandrian Wicca tradition. Orpheus and Blue Star Wicca, Maxine Sanders and Feri Tradition, and Verbius and British Traditional Wicca are either unrelated traditions or unrelated figures within the broader witchcraft movement.

In summary, the correct answer is "King of the Witches, Gardnerian Wicca" because it reflects both the spiritual name and the source from which Alex Sanders' coven claimed its lineage. This connection and inherited tradition highlights the various influences on Sanders' work, revealing how he and his contemporaries built on the foundations of Gardner's earlier work to create the diverse Wiccan traditions that exist today.
