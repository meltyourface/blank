To thoroughly respond to this challenge, let's break it down into three main sections: 

1. The detailed trajectory of Alex Sanders' life - focusing on his personal, educational, and magical aspects.
2. Analyzing his influence on modern neo-pagan witchcraft resurgence as a socio-political entity.
3. Reflecting upon the connections between his practices and any ensuing controversial figure or movement in the contemporary occult sphere.

### Section 1: The detailed trajectory of Alex Sanders' life

Born in 1926 in Manchester, England, Alexander Sanders experienced a rather difficult childhood. Raised in a deeply religious Christian family, he found solace in his spiritual explorations. As a teenager, Sanders discovered occultism, specifically the practice of witchcraft. He was fascinated by the teachings of prominent figures like Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, and Gerald Gardner, who each profoundly impacted his personal, educational, and magical life.

Sanders furthered his education in esotericism by joining a Gardnerian coven, where he rose to the rank of High Priest. Later, disillusioned with Gardnerian Witchcraft, Sanders forged his distinctive path, developing the Alexandrian Tradition. Through dedication and passion, he became a respected and prominent figure in the occult community, eventually earning the title "King of the Witches." 

### Section 2: Analyzing his influence on modern neo-pagan witchcraft resurgence as a socio-political entity

Sanders' charisma and dedication to the occult crafts significantly contributed to the neo-pagan witchcraft resurgence, popularizing esoteric practices and helping to transform them into socio-political phenomena. He brought witchcraft to the forefront of public awareness through media exposure, offering initiation ceremonies, and training others in the magical arts. By doing so, he helped to legitimize neo-pagan witchcraft.

His Alexandrian Tradition, blending elements of ceremonial magic, folk practices, and theosophy, attracted a diverse following, ushering in a new level of acceptability for neo-pagan witchcraft in society. In doing so, he helped create an environment where the broader neo-pagan community was more able to engage in dialogue with mainstream religions and political establishments. This dialogue allowed for more recognition, fostering acceptance and understanding of alternative spiritual paths.

### Section 3: Reflecting upon the connections between his practices and ensuing controversial figures or movements in contemporary occult circles

Sanders' relationship with the media and unquestionable impact on modern occultism inevitably led to controversy. For example, his well-publicized initiation ceremonies and magical rituals invoked moral panic, stoking fears around Satanism and occult practices. Despite the fears, the prominence of Sanders' work attracted many followers, also inspiring controversial offshoots and figures within the occult community.

His influence on modern paganism can be seen in the works of many leaders within the movement, such as Janet and Stewart Farrar, writers and practitioners who continued to build on Sanders' foundations. While his life and practices may have been the cause of controversy, the continued growth and acceptance of neo-pagan witchcraft today are indisputable legacies of his impact.

In conclusion, Alex Sanders' life offers a richly detailed trajectory of personal, educational, and magical experiences that contributed to the resurgence and legitimization of modern neo-pagan witchcraft as a socio-political entity. His influence has transcended esoteric circles, encouraging the expansion of the occult community and fostering acceptance of alternative spiritual paths by society. Through his work, various controversial figures and movements have emerged as part of the evolving landscape of contemporary occultism, further solidifying the indelible mark he left in the realm of magical practices.
