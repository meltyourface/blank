In answering this challenge, we will examine the initiation of Alex Sanders into the Gardnerian Wicca tradition, the development of Alexandrian Wicca, the key differences between these two traditions, the syncretic incorporations, and the philosophical implications for contemporary Wiccan practice.

Alex Sanders' Initiation into Gardnerian Wicca:
Alex Sanders, also known as the "King of the Witches," was initiated into the Gardnerian Wicca tradition in the early 1960s. The Gardnerian tradition, founded by Gerald Gardner in the mid-20th century, was one of the first modern Wiccan traditions and had a significant influence on the burgeoning Wiccan and Pagan communities. Gardnerian Wicca is often characterized by an emphasis on formal ritual practice, a hierarchical structure, and an adherence to the Book of Shadows, a collection of rituals, magical formulas and spells, and Wiccan lore.

Development of Alexandrian Wicca:
Sanders' dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the Gardnerian tradition, as well as his charismatic and somewhat controversial approach to public relations, led him to develop the Alexandrian Wicca tradition in the mid-1960s. Named after its founder, Alexandrian Wicca is an eclectic and syncretic tradition that incorporates elements from various magical traditions, including ceremonial magic, Qabalah, and various aspects of folk witchcraft.

Key Differences:
A few of the main differences between the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions lie in their approach to ritual, hierarchy, and secrecy. Gardnerian Wicca is known for being more formal and structured, with a rigid hierarchy and craft degrees, while Alexandrian Wicca is generally regarded as more eclectic and less hierarchical. Although both traditions maintain a degree of secrecy, Alexandrian Wicca is often considered to be less secretive than its Gardnerian counterpart.

In addition, Alexandrian Wicca tends to be more open to experimentation and innovation, whereas the Gardnerian tradition places more importance on adhering to established practices and the Book of Shadows. As a result, Alexandrian Wicca has a more diverse range of practices and magical techniques.

Syncretic Incorporations:
One of the defining characteristics of Alexandrian Wicca is its syncretic approach to magical traditions. Alex Sanders incorporated elements of ceremonial magic, particularly from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, into his practice. This includes the use of ceremonial tools such as the sword, wand, and dagger. Alexandrian Wicca also incorporates aspects of the Qabalah, with its symbolic and philosophical underpinnings woven into the tradition's rituals and teachings.

Furthermore, Alexandrian Wicca also blends elements of British folk witchcraft, including the use of traditional charms, folkloric mythology, and the veneration of regional spirits and deities. This eclectic mix of magical practices and ideas has contributed to the distinctiveness of the Alexandrian Wiccan tradition.

Philosophical Implications for Contemporary Wiccan Practice:
Alexandrian Wicca has had a lasting influence on contemporary Wiccan practice, particularly in its emphasis on experimentation, innovation, and syncretism. The openness of the Alexandrian tradition has allowed for a greater range of practices, beliefs, and ideas to be incorporated into modern Wicca.

Moreover, this syncretic approach has arguably encouraged practitioners to engage with other magical traditions and systems, fostering an atmosphere of dialogue, enquiry and growth across the wider Wiccan and Pagan communities. The pragmatic and creative ethos of Alexandrian Wicca has also shaped the way in which many modern Wiccans approach their craft, empowering them to adapt and innovate according to their personal needs and experiences.

In summary, Alex Sanders' initiation into the Gardnerian Wicca tradition and his later development of Alexandrian Wicca show a considerable shift in approach towards ritual, hierarchy, and secrecy. Alexandrian Wicca is characterized by its syncretic incorporations from various magical traditions, promoting experimentation, innovation, and a diverse range of practices and beliefs. The philosophical implications of Alexandrian Wicca for contemporary Wiccan practice continue to encourage dialogue and growth among practitioners, as well as shaping their approaches to the craft in both personal and group contexts.
