Answer: Alex Sanders is known for founding the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca, which draws upon both Gardnerian Wicca and ceremonial magic.

**Explanation**: Alex Sanders (1926-1988), also known as the "King of the Witches," was a prominent figure in the modern witchcraft and Wiccan movement. He is best known for founding the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca, which combines elements of both Gardnerian Wicca and ceremonial magic.

Alex Sanders was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca in 1962 but decided to develop his own tradition, based on his studies and experiences. Although he was deeply influenced by the Gardnerian tradition, founded by Gerald Gardner, Sanders sought to incorporate elements of ceremonial magic, Kabbalah, and other esoteric teachings into his new tradition. This unique blending of different paths became known as Alexandrian Wicca.

The main distinction between Alexandrian Wicca and Gardnerian Wicca lies in their ritual practices and emphasis on the use of ceremonial magic. Both traditions share a basic structure of rituals, initiation, and hierarchy, but Alexandrian Wicca tends to have a more eclectic approach, drawing from a wider range of sources.

It is important to note that Alex Sanders did not gain his notoriety primarily through authoring bestselling books on witchcraft. Rather, his fame was mostly due to his charismatic persona, his media presence, and his influence on the Wiccan community through the establishment of Alexandrian Wicca.

Although initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, Sanders didn't make his name solely because of this association. He went on to make significant contributions to the occult community with the founding of his unique path within Wicca.

Lastly, Sanders' influence extended beyond his role as a spiritual advisor to celebrities. His founding of Alexandrian Wicca and his role in expanding awareness of modern witchcraft practice left lasting effects on the occult community as a whole.

In conclusion, Alex Sanders' most significant contribution to modern witchcraft and the occult community was the founding of the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca. This path, which combined elements of Gardnerian Wicca and ceremonial magic, offered a unique and influential approach to the practice of witchcraft, establishing Sanders as an essential figure in the Wiccan and occult movements.
