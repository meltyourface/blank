To respond to the knowledge challenge, we will delve deeper into the initiation of Alex Sanders, the era in which he was active, his contribution to the development of Alexandrian Wicca, and the impact of his personal experiences on the practices and symbolism within the tradition.

Alex Sanders, born in 1926 and dubbed the "King of the Witches," was an influential figure within the modern Witchcraft and Wicca movement, particularly in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s. His initiation into Witchcraft - which is said to have happened in 1962 by his grandmother - marked the beginning of his journey towards creating his own strand of Wicca, known as Alexandrian Wicca. His initiation holds significance because it laid the foundation for the formation and evolution of Alexandrian Wicca and allowed him to draw from the various practices and experiences he had been immersed in throughout his life.

The context of the time period played a crucial part in creating the ripe conditions for Alexandrian Wicca to flourish. The 1960s and 1970s were characterized by cultural changes, the rise of feminism, sexual liberation, and the counterculture movement. There was an increased interest in the occult and alternative spiritualities, which allowed Sanders' teachings to gain popularity. The combination of the mystique surrounding Witchcraft and Wicca and the growing disillusionment with organized religion worked in his favor as many sought alternative spiritual paths.

The development of Alexandrian Wicca traces its roots to Gardnerian Wicca, founded by Gerald Gardner. However, Sanders incorporated elements from Ceremonial Magic, Kabbalah, and Egyptian symbolism, while still preserving much of Gardnerian Craft. Alexandrian Wicca placed a greater emphasis on ceremonial rituals and was more eclectic in its approach. This inclusion of various practices in Alexandrian Wicca led to an expansion of the Wiccan belief system and made it more accessible to a larger audience.

Sanders' personal experiences and background had a great influence on the practices and symbolism within the Alexandrian tradition. Born into a poor family in the UK, he was exposed to various psychic and spiritual practices from a young age, which shaped his own belief system. Throughout his life, Sanders was guided by spiritual experiences and was instrumental in developing a unique system that was based on his own understanding and interpretation of occult practices. The Alexandrian tradition thus became a synthesis of his own experiences and the teachings of various spiritual paths. For example, his experiences with ceremonial magic enhanced the strength and beauty of the rituals.

As for symbolism, Alexandrian Wicca is rich with both traditional and innovative imagery. Elements of the Kabbalah, such as the Tree of Life, feature prominently in the practice, while Sanders also incorporated unique symbols like the “Crook and Flail.” This blending of old and new symbology allowed for a vibrant and evolving tradition, which catered to a diverse range of practitioners. Sanders often encouraged personal interpretation and adaptation of symbolism, promoting individuality and creativity within the practice.

In conclusion, the initiation of Alex Sanders into Witchcraft played an important role in shaping not only his path but also the development of the Alexandrian Wicca tradition. The context of the time period, steeped in cultural change and growing interest in alternative spiritual paths, created favorable conditions for Alexandrian Wicca to gain popularity. Sanders’ contribution to its development is notable for his incorporation of multiple practices and belief systems, as well as his influence on the rich practices and symbolic aspects of Alexandrian Wicca. His personal experiences and background played an essential role in the evolution of the tradition, making it an eclectic and dynamic path that continues to inspire practitioners to this day.
