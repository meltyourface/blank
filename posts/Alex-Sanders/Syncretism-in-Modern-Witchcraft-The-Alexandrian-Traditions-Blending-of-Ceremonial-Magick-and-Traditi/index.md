The answer is: Incorporating aspects of ceremonial magick, alongside traditional witchcraft.

Alex Sanders, known as the "King of the Witches," was influential in the rise of modern witchcraft and the creation of the Alexandrian Tradition. His dedication to a syncretic approach in his practice was evident in his incorporation of aspects of ceremonial magick, alongside traditional witchcraft.

In order to understand the context of Alex Sanders' approach, it is important to first define the term "syncretic." Syncretism refers to the blending or merging of different belief systems, traditions, or religions to create a new, harmonious whole. In Sanders' case, he combined elements of various magickal systems, such as ceremonial magick, Kabbalah, and traditional witchcraft, in order to create the Alexandrian Tradition.

One of the reasons behind Sanders' syncretic approach was his belief that magick is a living and evolving entity that draws its power from various sources. He believed that, in order to harness the full spectrum of magical energies, one must be open to learning from diverse traditions and incorporating them into a cohesive practice.

Ceremonial magick, which Sanders integrated into the Alexandrian Tradition, is a form of magick that places a strong emphasis on elaborate rituals, tools, and symbols. It is rooted in Western esoteric traditions, such as Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and medieval grimoires. By incorporating ceremonial magick into the Alexandrian Tradition, Sanders expanded the scope of witchcraft beyond the more nature-based, folkloric practices that had been dominant up until that point.

The other answer choices do not reflect Sanders' dedication to a syncretic approach in his practice. Initiating Wiccan High Priestess Maxine Sanders as his partner speaks more to his personal relationships and leadership role in the witchcraft community. Authoring a grimoire based solely on ancient Egyptian practices would have limited the scope of his influences, which goes against his syncretic approach. Lastly, strict adherence to the Gardnerian Book of Shadows in his coven does not showcase his efforts to create a unique, innovative witchcraft tradition.

The Alexandrian Tradition, founded by Alex Sanders, reflects his dedication to a syncretic approach in the realm of modern witchcraft. The blending of ceremonial magick, traditional witchcraft, and other esoteric practices created a unique and influential tradition that has continued to have a significant impact on contemporary witchcraft.
