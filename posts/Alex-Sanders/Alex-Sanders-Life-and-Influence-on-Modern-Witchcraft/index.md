A. **Gardnerian Wicca**: The foundation of Alexandrian Wicca can be traced back to Gerald Gardner's work, which formed the basis of many modern Wiccan traditions. Sanders, who was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, synthesized its teachings with ceremonial magic, further evolving the tradition.

B. **Ceremonial Magic**: As a student of the Western esoteric tradition, Alex Sanders was deeply influenced by the works of noted occultists like Aleister Crowley and Eliphas Lévi. The incorporation of ceremonial magic, including Kabbalah, Tarot, and ritual tools, enriched the Alexandrian practice by giving it a more structured and systematic approach.

B. **Drawing Down the Moon**: This ritual involves the invocation of the Goddess into the body of the High Priestess, allowing the participants to experience the energies and wisdom of the Goddess in a direct and personal way.

C. **The Great Rite**: A central ritual in Alexandrian Wicca, the Great Rite is a symbolic sexual act representing the union of the God and Goddess. It can be conducted through actual physical contact or with a symbolic representation using ritual tools.

D. **Magical Tools**: Alexandrian Wicca makes use of various magical tools, including the athame (a double-edged knife used to direct energy), the wand, the chalice, the pentacle, and the scourge. Each of these tools holds specific symbolism and energy properties which aid in conducting rituals.
