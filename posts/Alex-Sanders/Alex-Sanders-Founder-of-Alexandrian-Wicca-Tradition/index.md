Answer: Founded the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca, which was primarily known for its focus on ceremonial magic.

Explanation: Alex Sanders, often referred to as the "King of the Witches," is best known for founding the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca. Born in 1926, Sanders was initiated into witchcraft in the early 1960s and went on to establish the Alexandrian Wicca lineage in the mid-1960s.

Alexandrian Wicca, named after Alexander the Great, is a blend of various magical practices, including British Traditional Witchcraft, ceremonial magic, and aspects of the Qabalah. It is a more eclectic and ceremonial form of Wicca in comparison to the earlier Gardnerian tradition, which was developed by Gerald B. Gardner in the 1950s.

The Alexandrian tradition's focus on ceremonial magic demonstrates the impact that Alex Sanders left on the field of the occult and esoteric. Ceremonial magic is a highly structured and systematic form of magic that uses rituals, symbols, and the invocation of spiritual beings to achieve specific goals. Sanders' emphasis on ceremonial magic reflects his desire to make magic accessible, disciplined, and practical for those who sought to learn his teachings.

While it is true that Sanders played a role in teaching and initiating students into the occult and esoteric, his impact stretches beyond the confines of specific individuals or courses. By founding a tradition of Wicca that incorporated ceremonial magic into its core practices, Sanders influenced a broad range of practitioners, fostering the growth and evolution of Wicca as we understand it today.

In this context, the establishment of the Alexandrian Wicca tradition had a more significant impact than Sanders merely being an influential occult teacher.

Though a prolific figure in the world of the occult, Alex Sanders did not write over 20 books or establish an international network of occult schools and covens to the same level that founding the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca had on his legacy and impact on the esoteric world.
