## Elixir of Stellar Sight

Ingredients:
1. 12 grams of Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - To stimulate psychic powers
2. 8 grams of Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) - To enhance visionary experiences
3. 5 grams of Blue Lotus (Nymphaea caerulea) - To deepen connection with the astral realm
4. 3 grams of Eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) - To promote clarity of the third eye
5. 1 small pinch of Ground Meteorite Powder - To attune to cosmic energies
6. 1 small piece of Moldavite (transformed into a fine powder) - To amplify spiritual vibrations
7. 600 ml of pure grain alcohol - As a base for the tincture
8. A glass jar with a tight lid, preferably opaque or dark-colored

Instructions:

1. Gather all herbs and ingredients during the waxing moon, when the moon is at its peak of growth and natural energy. This will harness the moon's potent energies to foster the development of psychic abilities.

2. Under the light of the full moon, blend the Mugwort, Wormwood, Blue Lotus, and Eyebright in a mortar and pestle until well-combined. While blending, envision the energy of the full moon permeating the herbs, supercharging their inherent properties.

3. Pour the herb mixture into the glass jar.

4. In a separate container, combine the ground meteorite powder and moldavite powder.

5. Add the meteorite and moldavite powder mixture to the jar containing the herbs.

6. Carefully pour the pure grain alcohol into the jar, ensuring all the herbs and powders are fully submerged. Seal the jar with its tight-fitting lid.

7. Infuse the tincture for a full lunar cycle (from full moon to full moon), storing it in a dark, cool place. Each day, gently shake the jar to mix the ingredients.

8. On the night of the next full moon, strain the tincture through a fine mesh cloth, retaining the liquid and discarding the solid remnants of the herbs and powders. Bottle the liquid into a new glass container with a dropper, sealing it tightly.

Ritual for Consecration and Charging:

1. Choose a sacred space where you can perform the consecration ritual undisturbed.

2. Cast a circle using your preferred method.

3. Light a white or purple candle to represent the opening of the third eye and invocation of higher vibrational energies.

4. Hold the tincture bottle in both hands, and focus your intention on activating the elixir's psychic powers.

5. **Speak the following incantation**:

    "Elixir of Stellar Sight,
    Conjure forth the astral light.
    Unveil what's hidden, amplify my sight,
    Awaken intuition, guide me right.
    By the power of moon, meteor, and stone,
    Charge this potion, make it known."

6. Close the circle and extinguish the candle.

7. Store the charged and consecrated elixir in a dark, cool place.

To use, take several drops of the Elixir of Stellar Sight under your tongue or in a small glass of water before meditation, astral travel, or any activity requiring enhanced psychic abilities. Always use the elixir responsibly and with positive intentions. The tincture's effects may intensify with repeated use, so use with care and adjust dosage accordingly.
