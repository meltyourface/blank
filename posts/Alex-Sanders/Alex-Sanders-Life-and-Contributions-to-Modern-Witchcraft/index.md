## The King of Witches: Life, Teachings, and Methods of Alex Sanders

Introduction

Alex Sanders, known as the "King of the Witches," was an influential figure in modern witchcraft. His contributions to the craft, specifically the founding of the Alexandrian tradition, have left an impact on contemporary practices. In this section, we will explore the life and teachings of Sanders and examine several notable rituals or spells attributed to him. This deep insight into his work will equip the occult student with a thorough understanding of his methods and their potential applications.

### I. Biographical Sketch of Alex Sanders

Born on June 6, 1926, in Manchester, England, Alexander Sanders grew up in a working-class family. He was first introduced to witchcraft and the occult through his grandmother, who was a hereditary witch. Sanders' interests expanded as he studied various magical systems, including ceremonial magic, the Kabbalah, and the works of Aleister Crowley.

In 1962, he met Maxine Morris. The couple eventually married, and Maxine became Sanders' high priestess. Together, they founded the Alexandrian tradition of witchcraft, named after Sanders himself. The Alexandrian tradition is considered one of the most prominent forms of modern witchcraft, drawing elements from Wicca, ceremonial magic, and other spiritual practices.

### II. Establishing the Alexandrian Tradition

As the name suggests, the Alexandrian tradition was primarily based on the teachings and practices of Alex Sanders. An eclectic mix of influences, it is characterized by its integration of Wiccan beliefs, high ceremonial magic, and other esoteric and folkloric elements. In contrast to the more nature-centered Gardnerian Wicca, the Alexandrian tradition places greater emphasis on ceremonial aspects and the use of ritual tools, with a strong focus on training and initiation.

### III. Key Contributions to Modern Witchcraft

Alex Sanders is credited with several notable contributions to modern witchcraft, specifically with regard to the foundational principles and practices of the Alexandrian tradition.

1. Integration of diverse, esoteric influences: Sanders was innovative in his approach to witchcraft, blending Wiccan principles, high ceremonial magic, Kabbalistic teachings, and other sources. This led to a dynamic, multifaceted tradition that has shaped the way in which occult students approach the craft today.

2. **Expansion of the Wiccan rituals and practices**: Sanders expanded Gardnerian Wiccan practice by incorporating elements of ceremonial magic, as well as rites from other sources, such as The Key of Solomon and The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.

3. **Development of a unique initiatory system**: The Alexandrian tradition practices a degree-based initiatory system, consisting of three primary degrees. This system enables practitioners to access deeper levels of knowledge and power as they progress through their magical training.

### IV. Notable Rituals and Spells

1. **The Drawing Down of the Moon**: This ritual, which Sanders adapted from Gardnerian Wicca, involves invoking the Goddess into the High Priestess, allowing her to embody the divine feminine. The goal of the ritual is to channel the energies of the Goddess, enabling the participants to receive her wisdom and guidance.

2. **The Great Rite**: As a fertility rite, the Great Rite in Alexandrian witchcraft involves the symbolic union of the God and Goddess through the High Priest and High Priestess. This rite seeks to celebrate the sacredness of sexuality, promote creative energy, and bring forth blessings to the coven or individuals involved.

3. **The Sabbat Rituals**: Throughout the Wheel of the Year, Alexandrian witches observe eight sabbats (festivals) that honor and celebrate the cycles of the earth and the divine. Each sabbat has specific rituals, practices, and spells associated with its particular significance. These rituals serve to connect practitioners with the flow of nature and the deities in their tradition.

### V. Significance and Applications for the Occult Student

For the aspiring occultist, understanding the life, teachings, and methods of Alex Sanders is essential in recognizing the historical and contemporary relevance of Alexandrian witchcraft. By exploring the rituals and practices attributed to Sanders, students are able to grasp the significance of his work and gain insight into the potential applications of his techniques.
