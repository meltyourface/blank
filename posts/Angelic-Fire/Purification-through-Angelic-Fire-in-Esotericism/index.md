The answer is: Purifying the soul and removing negative influences.

In the context of Angelic Fire and the esoteric tradition, the primary purpose of this divine energy is to purify the soul and remove negative influences from one's life. Angelic Fire is often seen as a manifestation of divine love and wisdom, serving as a transformative power that helps individuals advance on their spiritual journey.

One of the key concepts related to Angelic Fire is the idea of purification through spiritual alchemy. In ancient and medieval esoteric traditions, alchemy was a process through which base metals were transformed into gold. This concept was later adapted by spiritual alchemists to represent the transformation of one's soul from a less evolved state to a higher, more enlightened state.

The Angelic Fire is often associated with the energy of Archangel Michael, the epitome of divine will and strength. This energy acts as a purifier, refining the soul by helping individuals overcome negative emotions, harmful thought patterns, and subconscious blockages that can hinder spiritual growth.

Historically, various esoteric orders and mystery schools have employed spiritual practices and rituals designed to invoke the Angelic Fire. Examples of such practices include prayers, meditations, and visualization exercises. The intent behind these practices is to connect with the divine energy and direct it towards areas where purification, transformation, and healing are needed.

This energy, if harnessed properly, has the potential to help reveal an individual's true nature and promote spiritual growth. By eliminating negative influences, the soul is allowed to evolve and ascend to a higher state of consciousness.

Aside from the purification of the soul, the Angelic Fire also contributes to promoting healing and emotional well-being, enhancing psychic abilities and expanding consciousness, and assisting in the destruction of malevolent spirits. However, these are more like secondary benefits arising from the primary purpose of purifying the soul.

In conclusion, the primary purpose of the Angelic Fire in the esoteric tradition is to purify the soul, and help it transcend negative influences and spiritual blockages. By performing rituals and spiritual practices invoking the Angelic Fire, individuals can align their energies with divine love and wisdom, which are integral to the journey of spiritual evolution.
