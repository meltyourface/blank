In order to comprehend and respond to this knowledge challenge, I will not only provide a comprehensive answer covering the significance of Angelic Fire in terms of soul transformation and purification, but also elucidate on the understanding of angelic hierarchies, elemental correspondences and esoteric symbolism. Furthermore, the process by which an adept integrates and balances the Angelic Fire in their spiritual practice will be detailed, along with potential challenges that may arise during this journey.

Angelic Fire represents a divine spiritual energy associated with purification, transformation, and self-realization. It serves as a potential conduit between the human soul and the angelic realms, thus enabling spiritual growth and development. In achieving the integration and balance of Angelic Fire within one's spiritual practice, an adept must draw upon the knowledge of angelic hierarchies, elemental correspondences, and esoteric symbolism.

Angelic hierarchies represent the classification and ordering of angelic beings based on their proximity to the divine source and the degree of their spiritual illumination. The most widely recognized hierarchy is the one proposed by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in his work, "The Celestial Hierarchy". This structure consists of three triads or orders, with each triad containing three choirs. The first triad contains the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; the second consists of the Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; and the third triad is the Principalities, Archangels, and Angels.

Elemental correspondences refer to the association of various elemental properties to spiritual concepts, deities, and angelic beings. In the context of Angelic Fire, the primary corresponding element is Fire, which symbolizes spiritual transformation, purification, and illumination. Associated with the governing angels of each choirs, these correspondences also help in maintaining a sound equilibrium between the spiritual forces.

Esoteric symbolism is the use of allegories and symbols to convey deeper, hidden meanings behind spiritual concepts. Adepts must develop the ability to decipher these symbols and extract their deeper meanings to enrich their spiritual practice. Examples of esoteric symbolism in Angelic Fire include the flaming sword of Archangel Michael, which signifies protection and the removal of negativity, and the ascending phoenix, which represents transformation and rebirth through the embracing of Angelic Fire.

The integration and balancing of Angelic Fire within an adept's spiritual practice involves several steps:

1. Establishing a connection with angelic hierarchies: The adept should begin by invoking the guidance and protection of the angelic choirs to harness the power of Angelic Fire and create a conducive atmosphere for spiritual work.

2. Understanding and applying elemental correspondences: The adept should then discern the associations between angelic forces and elemental properties, applying them to their own spiritual work, meditation, and rituals.

3. Deciphering esoteric symbolism: By delving into the hidden meanings behind symbols and allegories, the adept can incorporate the profound teachings of Angelic Fire into their personal journey of self-discovery and spiritual evolution.

4. Maintaining equilibrium amidst the interplay of light and darkness: To preserve balance throughout their spiritual practice, adepts must recognize the coexistence and interconnectedness of light and dark forces within and without.

Potential challenges that an adept might face during this journey include the risk of delusion or misinterpretation of esoteric symbolism, the temptation to misuse Angelic Fire for personal gain or manipulation, and the potential for imbalance between light and dark forces, which could lead to spiritual stagnation or setbacks.

In conclusion, the integration and balance of Angelic Fire in one's spiritual practice requires a deep understanding of angelic hierarchies, elemental correspondences, and esoteric symbolism. The adept must learn to navigate potential challenges during their spiritual journey and maintain equilibrium amidst the interplay of light and darkness. Through perseverance and dedication, a seeker may harness the transformative energy embodied by Angelic Fire, ultimately leading to spiritual enlightenment and self-realization.
