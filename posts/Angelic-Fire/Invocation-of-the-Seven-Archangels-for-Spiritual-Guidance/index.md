In the name of the Divine, I call upon the sacred seven,
Masters of elements, guardians from high heaven,
Join me in this circle of power, virtue, and grace,
Archangels of Angelic Fire, to this sacred space.

In the East, I call upon Raphael, Mercurial sage,
Angel of Air, healer and guide through every age,
Name of God, YHVH, shines on your radiant brow,
Bring your wisdom and intellect, unite with us now!

In the South, I summon Michael, champion and sword,
Angel of Fire, protector of the celestial accord,
Name of God, Elohim, a blazing flame upon your crest,
Bring your courage and strength, stand by us in this quest.

In the West, I beckon Gabriel, lunar Queen of seas,
Angel of Water, emotional depths, and mysteries,
Name of God, El Shaddai, flows within your soothing tide,
Bring your intuition and clarity, with us confide.

In the North, I invoke Uriel, cosmic judge and force,
Angel of Earth, stability, a guiding light in our course,
Name of God, Adonai, upon thine earthen shield,
Bring your grounding energy, ensure our spirits yield.

In the center, I summon Zadkiel, gracious mystic ray,
Angel of Aether, wisdom and mercy, blessings to convey,
Name of God, Tzabaoth, in sacred alchemical streams,
Bring your grace and compassion, transcend mortal dreams.

Above, I call upon Raziel, cosmic secrets divine,
Angel of Time, guardian of the enigmatic design,
Name of God, Eheieh, enhances the celestial arch,
Bring your knowledge of the ages, illumination to embark.

Below, I invite Metatron, resplendent angelic king,
Angel of Light, unifier of realms, transcendent offering,
Name of God, YHWH, illuminates your golden crown,
Bring your celestial harmony, align with us on this ground.

Oh, sacred seven of Angelic Fire, lend us your celestial might,
Empower this invocation, protect us through day and night,
United in Divine purpose, our spirits now ignite,
The circle is complete, in harmony and light.
