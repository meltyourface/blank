description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Poetry, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Transform the lyrics of a chosen ballad into a sonnet, carefully weaving the original theme and evoking emotion within the refined structure of 14 lines of iambic pentameter. Employ a discerning selection of poetic devices such as alliteration, anaphora, and enjambment to intensify the imagery and elicit a profound reaction in the reader. Engage in a thoughtful exploration of the melody's metaphors and motifs, while preserving its essence through a harmonious union of elegant verse and a striking volta.

Upon a hill beneath a charmed moon gleams,
Amaranthine dreams are spun, so it seems,
In tapestry of twilight, whispered sighs,
Our hero weeps as his forlorn heart cries.

In dulcet tones, by mournful minstrel sung,
A fair maid's heartstrings tethered and hung,
An undying love beyond this mortal shore,
Oh, bind us once more with the vows we swore.

But radiant sun descends, its last refrain,
Tears not dried as sweet voices' shadows wane,
Must soulful lament in cold silence rest?
A ghost still inhabits this mortal breast.

Now distant silence echoes through the line,
In astral spheres our parted souls entwine.
