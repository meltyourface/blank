Combine elements of chanting, visualization, and the vibrational use of Thelemic sacred words or phrases to augment the meditation experience. Make sure to include a step-by-step guide for the practitioner that leads them through the necessary preparations, deepening relaxation, and subsequent astral journey, culminating in an encounter with the essence of Babalon and the empowerment of the individual's spiritual connection.
