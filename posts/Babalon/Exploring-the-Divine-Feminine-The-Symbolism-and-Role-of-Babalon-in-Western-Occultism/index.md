## Babalon: The Sacred Whore and Her Role in Thelema and Western Occultism

Introduction

Babalon, also known as the Great Mother or the Scarlet Woman, is a complex and enigmatic figure in the Western esoteric tradition. She has been described as the personification of divine feminine energy, embodying both the creative and destructive aspects of the divine. As a symbol of liberation and sensuality, Babalon has played a significant role in the practices and beliefs of Thelema and Western occultism as a whole.

1) Symbolism of Babalon 

Babalon is often represented as a beautiful, nude woman holding a chalice overflowing with the elixir of life. She rides upon a seven-headed beast, embodying the seven deadly sins and the seven realms of creation. The number seven is a recurring motif in her symbolism, as it represents the divine balance between the spiritual and the material.

In Western occultism, Babalon embodies the pure, untainted, and liberated feminine energy. She is a powerful symbol of female sexuality and stands in contrast to the patriarchal and restrictive forces often found in traditional religious structures. 

2) Babalon in Thelema 

Thelema, a spiritual and philosophical movement founded by the famous occultist Aleister Crowley, holds Babalon as a central figure in its cosmology and ritual practices. Crowley described Babalon as the source of inspiration for The Book of the Law, the foundational text of Thelema, which emphasizes the attainment of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and self-realization.

In Thelemic teachings, Babalon represents the divine feminine aspect of the supreme godhead, Nuit. She is the gateway to spiritual enlightenment and attainment, offering the aspirant the opportunity to unite with the divine through an ecstatic merger of the self and the spiritual realm.

3) Babalon and the Tarot

Babalon is closely associated with the Tarot, particularly the card of the Lust (in some decks, Strength). This card represents the driving force of creativity, desire, and power that is expressed through the divine feminine. It is a symbol of the integration of the spiritual and material worlds, as well as the transformation of base desires into enlightened aspirations.

In the Thoth Tarot deck designed by Aleister Crowley and Lady Frieda Harris, the Lust card prominently features a depiction of Babalon, symbolizing the culmination of the spiritual journey and the union of opposites. This card often signifies the need to assert oneâ€™s will and to find inner strength in the face of adversity.

4) Magical Workings and Rituals

In Thelemic and Western occult practices, Babalon plays a significant role in various magical workings and rituals. Some of the key rituals where Babalon is invoked or honored include:

a) The Star Sapphire: This ritual is inspired by the hexagram, representing the union of opposites and the balance between male and female energies. The practitioner invokes Babalon to aid in the attainment of spiritual enlightenment and personal transformation.

b) The Gnostic Mass: In this ceremony, Babalon is represented by the Priestess, who is the living embodiment of the divine feminine. She acts as the intermediary between the material and spiritual worlds, granting the congregation access to divine wisdom and power.

c) The Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel: Babalon is called upon to help the practitioner attain knowledge and conversation with their Holy Guardian Angel, a higher aspect of oneself that can guide and protect the aspirant on their spiritual path.

Conclusion

Babalon is an enigmatic and powerful figure in the Western esoteric tradition and the practices of Thelema. Acting as both a symbol for spiritual transformation and liberation, her presence offers a deep understanding of the divine feminine and its role in breaking free from restrictive societal norms. For practitioners interested in exploring Babalon's significance, there is a wealth of rituals, practices, and interpretations available to help develop a personal relationship with this compelling figure.
