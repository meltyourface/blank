The Thoughtless Crown of the Dragon, a term found in the esoteric and occult practices originating from John Dee's Spiritual Diaries, bears the mark of a deep-seated connection between Theurgy and the endeavors of Dee. This analysis aims to explore this intricate connection, shedding light on the characteristics of Theurgy, its effects on Dee's unique methods, and the historical context in which these practices took place.

John Dee (1527-1608) was a prominent British mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I. However, he is best known for his efforts in the realm of the occult, particularly in the study of angelic communication and the development of the Enochian language. Dee's Spiritual Diaries serve as a testament to his lifelong quest for wisdom and understanding of the universe by means of contacting higher, divine entities.

Theurgy, a spiritual practice that involves invoking and communicating with divine entities and forces, was instrumental to Dee’s work. Rooted in Neoplatonism, Theurgy aimed to achieve an intimate connection between the human individual and the divine, ultimately leading to spiritual enlightenment and salvation. Dee’s devotion to this practice can be seen throughout his diaries as a driving force behind his quest for occult knowledge.

In the case of John Dee, his Theurgical endeavors were focused on contacting angels to gain insights into the hidden workings of the universe. This undertaking gave birth to his scrying practices, wherein he made use of a "scryer" or medium, such as Edward Kelley, to communicate with angelic beings via a crystal ball or other reflective surfaces. These scrying sessions were meticulously recorded in his spiritual diaries, encompassing detailed accounts of the visions experienced and knowledge obtained.

The angelic communications were further facilitated by the Enochian language, which Dee and Kelley claimed to have received from the angelic beings themselves. This unique and complex language added depth to Dee's Theurgical practices, as it was considered the original language of the angels and could potentially grant more direct access to their knowledge.

The historical significance of Dee's work in Thoughtless Crown of the Dragon extends beyond his own endeavors. In the 16th century, the practice of Theurgy was not widely accepted and contemporaries often criticized his methods, labeling him a sorcerer or even a heretic. Despite this, John Dee's work laid the foundation for further exploration of the occult and influenced other notable occultists such as Aleister Crowley, Israel Regardie, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

In comparing the Theurgical philosophies of different occultists, it is evident that each carried their own interpretation of the divine and the methods to invoke or communicate with these divine beings. For instance, Aleister Crowley focused more on the self and achieving personal divinity, whereas Dee sought direct communication with the divine through angelic messengers. Yet, the underlying connections between their practices demonstrate a shared interest in the quest for transcendent knowledge and truth.

In conclusion, the Theurgical practices of John Dee and his Spiritual Diaries played an instrumental role in shaping the Thoughtless Crown of the Dragon, demonstrating a profound relationship between the two elements. By invoking divine forces and entities, Dee sought to attain a profound understanding of the universe, leading to the development of the Enochian language and his scrying practices. The historical context, comparisons with other occultists, and the significance of John Dee's work reveal the extent to which Theurgy contributed to the development of the Thoughtless Crown of the Dragon.
