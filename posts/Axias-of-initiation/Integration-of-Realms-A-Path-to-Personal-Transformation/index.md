In order to provide a comprehensive response to the knowledge challenge, we must first delve into the fundamental nature of the three primary axias of initiation and their specific roles in the context of an individual's personal growth and transformation. The axias of initiation are Mentality, Emotionality, and Physicality. These realms are inextricably linked, and their integration leads to a profound transformation in the initiate's self-awareness, spiritual growth, and relationship with the universe. 

1. ****Mentality****: This realm is concerned with the cognitive aspects of an individual. Mentality encompasses the intellectual faculties, such as reasoning, perception, memory, and intuition. This axia also covers the various systems of knowledge, abstraction, and synthesis that are used by the individual to form a coherent and logical worldview.

2. ****Emotionality****: The realm of Emotionality relates to the emotional life and the cultivation of emotional intelligence. It includes the various feelings, desires, and affections that influence our behavior, relationships, and sense of self. This axia covers the understanding and expression of emotions, emotional regulation, empathy, and other aspects of emotional intelligence.

3. ****Physicality****: Physicality represents the tangible and corporeal aspects of existence. It includes the physical body, health and vitality, as well as the range of actions, skills, and techniques that can be employed in the material world. This realm also extends to the various practices that individuals undertake to nurture and enhance their physical well-being and their relationship to the environment.

The Integration Process:

The key to a profound transformation in self-awareness and spiritual growth lies in the integration of these three realms. **The following elucidates the step-by-step process of achieving a harmonious balance between the axias of initiation**:
**Step 1**: Developing Self-Awareness: The initiate must first cultivate awareness of their own mental, emotional, and physical states. This involves constant self-reflection, introspection, and observation of the interplay between thoughts, emotions, and actions. This awareness allows an understanding of how the realms influence one another and, ultimately, the individual's existence as a whole.
**Step 2**: Balancing the Realms: It is essential for an initiate to find a balance between the three realms. This may involve developing underutilized faculties, channeling energy into previously neglected aspects of the self, and seeking equanimity between the mental, emotional, and physical dimensions of life. This balance fosters harmony, peace, and a sense of profound union with the self.
**Step 3**: Cultivating Inner Alchemy: Integration of the primary axias of initiation leads to an alchemical transformation in the individual. Alchemy here implies a process of conversion or transmutation through which the different aspects are transformed and blended into a unified whole. This inner alchemy enables an individual to experience a state of spiritual transcendence and informs their relationship with the universe.
**Step 4**: Expanding Consciousness: As the realms become more harmoniously integrated and the individual undergoes inner alchemy, their consciousness expands, and they develop a more profound understanding of the interconnected nature of existence. This heightened awareness allows the initiate to perceive the interconnectedness of the universe with greater clarity and wisdom, which subsequently deepens their spiritual growth.
**Step 5**: Transcending Limitations: The final step of the process involves transcending the limitations imposed by the un-integrated state. As the initiate evolves through the various stages of integration and consciousness expansion, they become capable of manifesting their spiritual potential and ultimately actualizing their highest aspirations.

In summary, the integration of the three primary axias of initiation - Mentality, Emotionality, and Physicality - is crucial for an individual's personal growth and spiritual evolution. The harmonious balance of the realms, fostering inner alchemy, expanding consciousness, and transcending limitations, collectively contributes to the profound transformation in the initiate's self-awareness, spiritual progression, and connection with the universe.
