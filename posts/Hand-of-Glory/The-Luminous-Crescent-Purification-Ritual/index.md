The Purification Ritual of the Luminous Crescent

**Purpose**: To cleanse and consecrate objects or areas affected by the malevolent powers of the Hand of Glory and to restore balance by counteracting its energies.

Materials required:

1. Four white circle-inscribed candles
2. Four onyx stones
3. Sage or palo santo bundle for smudging
4. Bell or chime
5. Consecrated water in a glass bowl
6. Athame or ritual knife
7. Salt
8. Olive oil
9. Sacred symbols and sigils, depending on personal faith

**Preparation**:

1. Clean the area where the ritual will be performed.
2. Place the four circle-inscribed candles in each cardinal direction (north, east, south, west).
3. Position the four onyx stones equidistantly between each candle.
4. Draw sacred symbols and sigils on the affected objects or in the affected area with olive oil or create sigil tokens to place around the affected object/area.

The Ritual:
**Step 1**: Begin by lighting the sage or palo santo bundle. Waft the smoke around the affected area or object, reciting the following incantation:

"I call upon the Luminous Crescent, guardians of light and balance, to purify this space of malevolence and darkness. As the smoke clears, may peace and purity prevail."
**Step 2**: Ring the bell or chime three times to symbolize the breaking of bonds created by the Hand of Glory.
**Step 3**: Mix a pinch of salt into the consecrated water, symbolizing the purification of the item or area. Sprinkle the salted water around the space or upon the object with the following invocation:

"By water and salt, I cleanse and consecrate this space, restoring harmony and balance to all it touches."
**Step 4**: Light the four white circle-inscribed candles, one by one, representing the triumph of light over darkness. As you light each candle, recite the following words:

"May the divine flame illuminate all shadows cast by the Hand of Glory and bring forth renewed strength and purity."
**Step 5**: Hold the athame or ritual knife and trace the sacred symbols or sigils, repeating the following prayer:

"By the power of the divine, and the strength of the symbols and sigils I've drawn, I seal this space from all malevolent energies of the Hand of Glory. May these symbols protect and shield, allowing only positive energies to pass."
**Step 6**: Allow the candles to burn until they extinguish themselves, signifying the complete cleansing of the area or object. Dispose of the remnants properly to symbolize the final banishment of the Hand of Glory's influence.
**Step 7**: Express gratitude to the Luminous Crescent and any other deities or beings invoked during the ritual, and close the circle.

Once the ritual has been successfully completed, the affected objects or areas should be cleansed of the malevolent powers of the Hand of Glory, with balance and purity restored. Remember to cleanse and banish regularly to keep the energies at bay.
