The Ecstatic God, a powerful figure that transcends simple myth and belief, permeates various cultures and their artistic expressions. For the purpose of this investigation, we will focus on one renowned artistic representation of the Ecstatic God and its influence on art and society.

One of the most iconic depictions of divine rapture can be found in the "Transfiguration" by the Italian High Renaissance master, Raphael in 1520. This painting is a striking scene that portrays the transfiguration and momentary reunion of Jesus with the divine. The upper part of the artwork shows Jesus floating above the apostles, basking in the light of the divine, while the lower section depicts the earthly chaos ensuing below.

The socio-religious context of this piece is deeply rooted in Christianity during the High Renaissance, a time when religion played a significant role in determining art and its themes. The Transfiguration not only captures a profound religious experience but also represents the typical artistic focus of the period, valuing harmony, balance, and idealized beauty. In this piece, the symbolic elements include the ethereal light surrounding Jesus, an indication of his divine nature, as well as the contrast between the calm radiance above and the turmoil below. Raphael's stylistic choice, characterized by precise composition and the use of vivid colors, effectively communicates the themes of transformation and spiritual rapture.

Raphael's connection to the divine is evident in how he skillfully captures the essence of religious ecstasy. The impact this painting had on society at the time is immeasurable, as it opened the doors for countless artists to depict moments of communion with the divine.

To contrast this work, we can examine two other artistic representations inspired by the theme of the Ecstatic God. Firstly, Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture "The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa" (1647-52) displays a life-like portrayal of the Carmelite mystic experiencing an intense rapture. The attention to detail and the choice of using marble as the medium further enhances the sense of divine intervention, emphasizing the power of the Ecstatic God's domain. Bernini's work effectively altered the Baroque art world's approach to religious themes, allowing for more emotive and dramatic interpretations.

Lastly, Frida Kahlo's "The Broken Column" (1944) provides an interesting variation on the notion of the Ecstatic God. While not a typical depiction of divine rapture, this painting offers an insight into Kahlo's personal struggles and her relationship with pain and transcendence. This modern interpretation of the Ecstatic God allows us to understand that spiritual experiences can also occur in times of hardship and adversity.

In summary, the influence of the Ecstatic God's domain on art is evident across history through various mediums and styles. Notably, Raphael's "Transfiguration" showcases a transformative moment of communion with the divine, influencing future generations of artists to redefine their relationship with religion and spirituality. Contrastingly, works like Bernini's "The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa" and Frida Kahlo's "The Broken Column" display different perspectives on the subject, creating a broad and multifaceted narrative on the themes of spirituality and transcendence.
