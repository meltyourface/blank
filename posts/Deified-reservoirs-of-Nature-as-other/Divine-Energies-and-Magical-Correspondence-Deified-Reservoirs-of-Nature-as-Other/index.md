In order to respond to the knowledge challenge, we must first understand the various components involved. The Deified reservoirs of Nature-as-other is a concept that refers to the idea that there are divine forces or energies within nature that originate from a higher realm or source. These reservoirs act as vessels through which these forces manifest and influence the physical world. This concept interconnects with the core principles of occultism, esotericism, and metaphysics in several ways, which will be explored in this response. Furthermore, we will discuss how this interconnection affects the practice and understanding of the magical axiom "As above, So below."

Firstly, let us delve into the core principles of occultism. Occultism is the study of secret or hidden wisdom and knowledge, which is often connected to spiritual or supernatural phenomena. The belief in Deified reservoirs of Nature-as-other can be seen as an occult concept because it posits the existence of hidden or elusive divine energies within nature that are accessible to those who seek to uncover and tap into them.

This idea also resonates with esotericism, which refers to the study or pursuit of knowledge that is meant for a select few, often involving complex, arcane teachings and symbolism. As the Deified reservoirs of Nature-as-other concept revolves around divine forces within the natural world, esotericism can be used as a tool to understand and decipher these forces' symbolism and meaning.

Metaphysics, on the other hand, is the branch of philosophy that deals with the fundamental nature of reality - including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, and potentiality and actuality. The Deified reservoirs of Nature-as-other concept aligns with metaphysics in that it posits the existence of a divine energy or force that transcends and shapes the physical world, thereby bridging the gap between the material and immaterial realms.

Taking these interconnected principles into account, we can now examine the implications of the Deified reservoirs of Nature-as-other concept on the magical axiom "As above, So below." This axiom, derived from the ancient text "The Emerald Tablet," asserts that there is a correspondence between the macrocosm (the greater reality) and the microcosm (the individual or local reality).

To illustrate how the Deified reservoirs of Nature-as-other concept impacts this axiom, let's consider an example: imagine a practitioner of magic seeking to tap into the divine energies present within a specific reservoir, such as a sacred grove. By understanding the esoteric principles and symbolism associated with this particular location, the practitioner can draw upon the reservoir's latent power to manifest change in the physical world, reflecting the divine energies from "above" (the metaphysical source of the power) into "below" (the physical realm).

In summary, the Deified reservoirs of Nature-as-other concept is deeply interwoven with the core principles of occultism, esotericism, and metaphysics. It postulates that divine forces or energies originating from a higher realm are present within nature and that these forces can be accessed and harnessed through esoteric study and practice. Moreover, this concept has significant implications on the understanding and application of the magical axiom "As above, So below." By tapping into the divine energies within these reservoirs, practitioners of magic can create a direct connection between the metaphysical and physical worlds, embodying and manifesting the axiom in their work.
