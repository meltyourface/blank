In this section, we shall delve headfirst into the captivating world of Silvaticae, exploring its origin, history, beliefs, rituals, and the roles of its practitioners.

### II. Origin and History of the Silvaticae Tradition

Silvaticae has origins in ancient pagan rituals and traditions that fostered respect and reverence for the symbiotic relationship between humans and the natural world. Rooted in animism, these early customs were built on the belief that all living entities — including trees, animals, and the natural elements — contained spiritual energy and intelligence. As civilizations evolved, so too did Silvaticae. Still, whether practiced by early tribal communities or later organized secret societies, the core principles have withstood the test of time, remaining closely intact.
