Invocation to the Keeper of Secrets: Thoth, the Sacred Scribe

(Symbol: Begin by inscribing the sacred Caduceus upon your altar or on parchment)

In the shadows of the sacred Tree of Wisdom, I call upon thee, Thoth, the Wise, the Keeper of Secrets, to heed my plea, and grant me thine sacred wisdom and knowledge.

(Sacred Numerology: 3, 9, 12, 21 - representing cycles of wisdom and rejuvenation)

In the name of the threefold path, the nine celestial spheres, the twelve sacred signs, and the ever-revolving cycle of twenty-one, I invoke thee, O Thoth, Grant unto me the knowledge of magic's eternal reign.

(Planetary Alignment: Align the ceremony with the Moon waxing crescent in Gemini)

By the waxing crescent rising in Gemini, I align our essences. Your essence, intertwined with the winds of wisdom and the seeds of knowledge, I invoke thee.

Great Thoth, O Ibis-headed God, the Divine Scribe, the measurer of Time, the Keeper of the Akashic Records, the Master of the Words of Power. We remember, in your sacred shades, that thou didst grant the gift of writing unto mankind, to transcribe the words of the Gods as messages of eternal wisdom.

O Thoth, I invoke thee by your sacred emblems of knowledge and unending memory, the papyrus scroll, and the palette, bestowing unto mankind the wisdom of the Divine.

The Desired Outcome:

(Incantation in Egyptian)

Am-khentet-nebeb r-khau rwntu setat-hi abw, Dedeq-k neferu sheru y-tu Au-tu her-t.

Translation: I seek the hidden knowledge of the ethers and the essence of universal truths, Guide me into the realms of wisdom and enlightenment.

(Chants and Rituals: Light a candle inscribed with the lunar symbol and intone the following chant)

By the sacred light of Seshat's guiding flame,
Within my mind, your sacred words shall claim.
Thoth, great teacher, whose voice resounds,
In mysteries deep, I seek thy hallowed grounds.

As I partake in the sacred actions of libation and incense (offer water and lit incense), grant unto me insight, inspiration, and understanding, O, Thoth, whose wisdom spans the sky like a great cosmic scroll.

In the spirit of the Tree of Wisdom tradition, bring forth your knowledge, that I may be initiated into the mysteries of the universe, mastering both the seen and unseen worlds, and walk in the footsteps of those who have gone before me.

I offer my deepest gratitude and honor, O Thoth, the Sacred Scribe. May your wisdom, your knowledge, and your power abide within me for as long as the stars hold their vigil above us.

Ankh, udja, seneb! (Life, Prosperity, Health!)

(Extinguish the candle, and meditate on the wisdom and knowledge desired)

So be it!
