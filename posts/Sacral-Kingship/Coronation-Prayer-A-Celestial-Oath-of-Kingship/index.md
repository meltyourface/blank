  I. Acknowledgment of the King's Divine Lineage
  
  O Sovereigns of the Eons and Architects of the Cosmos,
  Hear my words as I, (Name), King of (Kingdom),
  Descendant of the hallowed lineage of the Sacred Blood,
  Stand before you in humble recognition of my celestial ancestry,
  A vessel of your divine essence, forged through generations.
  
  II. Supplication to the Supreme Celestial Deities
  
  Eternal Lords of the Heavenly Sphere, I beseech thee:
  Bestow upon me the wisdom of the stars, the strength of the sun,
  And the grace of the moon, so I may reign in your image;
  Perceive my heart, hewed in devotion, with adoration, I call:
  (Acknowledge the names of the primary celestial deities) 
  
  III. Enumeration of the King's Virtuous Deeds
  
  In my kingly service, I humbly present thee my acts of virtue:
  I have ruled justly, guided by your divine principles,
  Protected my people, shepherd to their earthly sojourn,
  Fostered prosperity, planting bountiful seeds of abundance,
  And upheld honor, as a beacon of celestial morality in every choice.
  
  IV. Closing Plea for Spiritual Guidance
  
  Majestic Ones, as I ascend on this sacred rite,
  Continue to walk beside me, Illuminate my path;
  Guardians and Guides, in unity, we strive to preserve
  The harmony of the celestial and mortal domains,
  May your guidance keep me steadfast as your Sacral King.
  
  In closing, I pledge my unwavering fidelity,
  To uphold the cosmic balance, as a conduit for your divine light,
  On this hallowed ascension and through all the days of my reign,
  For the welfare of creation, your will through my hands,
  So be it, eternally intertwined, our fates aligned as one.
