To establish an intricate collection of divine artifacts and ceremonial attire for the Sacral Monarch, I have carefully researched and curated the following items, each possessing unique mystical properties and symbolic significance. These items will elevate and reinforce the otherworldly power and authority of the revered Sacral Monarch.

1. **The Enchanted Scepter of Divine Channeling**: This scepter, crafted from the ethereal metal, celestial gold, is engraved with ancient runes, each invoking the power of divine energies. When held by the monarch, the scepter acts as a conduit between them and the spiritual planes to channel divine energy. This empowers the ruler, granting them the ability to perform supernatural feats, such as controlling the elements and healing the afflicted.

2. **The Crown of Celestial Ascendance**: This ornate crown is set with rare and precious gemstones representing the nine spiritual planes: celestial ruby, lunar diamond, solar emerald, astral sapphire, ethereal amethyst, elemental garnet, abyssal opal, celestial pearl, and divine morganite. Wearing the crown heightens the monarch's frequency, connecting them on a deeper level with the spiritual world and allowing them to communicate with otherworldly beings.

3. **The Talisman of Psychic Heritage**: Passed down through generations, this ancient silver talisman is inscribed with the sacred symbol of the monarch's bloodline. When worn around the monarch's neck, the talisman enhances the ruler's psychic abilities, enabling them to foresee future events, influence the thoughts of others, and perceive alternate realities.

4. **The Robes of Sacred Sovereignty**: These ceremonial robes are woven from the threads of destiny, spun by the Fates themselves. The fabric of the robe holds the essence of the Sacral Kingship's transcendent divine purpose. Wearing the robe amplifies the monarch's inherent power and authority, ensuring that their decisions and actions are aligned with the greater cosmic plan.

5. **The Orb of Spiritual Harmony**: This luminous crystal orb, imbued with powerful, mystical energy, sits atop an altar at the heart of the monarch's sacred sanctuary. The orb serves as a conduit through which the ruler can connect with the spiritual realms, receiving guidance and wisdom from their otherworldly advisors.

Narrative: The legend of these artifacts begins with the birth of the monarch's ancestor, a divine progenitor who emerged from the celestial realm to guide humankind through its nascent stages. Bestowed upon the progenitor by the higher beings were the Enchanted Scepter, the Crown of Celestial Ascendance, and the Talisman of Psychic Heritage to lead humanity with divine wisdom.

Over generations, the Sacred Robes were woven by the Fates themselves as a testament to the monarch's divine purpose, while the Orb of Spiritual Harmony was a gift from the ethereal guardians, acknowledging the monarch's progression in spiritual mastery.

Each of these divine artifacts has been a vital part of the Sacral Kingship's legacy, reinforcing and preserving its otherworldly power for future generations. Today, they continue to grant their mystical blessings to the enlightened ruler, forging the way to a future guided by divine wisdom and celestial grace.
