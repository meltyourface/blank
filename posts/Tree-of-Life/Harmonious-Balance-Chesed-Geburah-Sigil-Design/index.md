excerpt: > 
  Design an intricate sigil that artistically merges the characteristics and energies of the two chosen sephiroth on the Tree of Life. Ensure that the sigil incorporates the corresponding Hebrew letters, colors, and planetary associations of the chosen sephiroth, while also reflecting their divine attributes and correspondences within the overall structure of the Kabbalistic Tree. Experiment with various geometric shapes and patterns to convey the harmonious fusion of these mystical energies in your exceptional creation.

As a AI language model, I cannot draw images, however, I can describe the concept, constituents, and symbolism of the sigil based on your requirements. The two chosen Sephiroth for this sigil design are Chesed (Mercy) and Geburah (Severity). 

Characteristics and energies to be incorporated in the sigil:
1. **Chesed (Mercy)**: Associated with the planet Jupiter, Chesed represents the divine energy of loving-kindness and mercy. Its Hebrew letter is ח (Heth), and its color is blue.

2. **Geburah (Severity)**: Associated with the planet Mars, Geburah represents the divine energy of strength and severity. Its Hebrew letter is ג (Gimel) and its color is red.

Concept of the Sigil:
The sigil will be designed as a double-layered hexagon with the inner hexagon symbolizing the harmonious fusion of Chesed and Geburah, and the outer hexagon containing the corresponding Hebrew letters, colors, and planetary associations. 

Inner Layer:
The inner layer comprises interlocking blue and red triangles representing Chesed and Geburah respectively. Chesed's blue triangle points upward, symbolizing the energy of Mercy rising, while Geburah's red triangle points downward, representing the energy of Severity descending. The points where the triangles intersect form a six-pointed star (Magen David), which epitomizes the harmonious balance of divine energies.

Outer Layer:
Each corner of the outer hexagon will contain the respective attributes of Chesed and Geburah in alternating order. **The following attributes will be placed clockwise, starting from the top corner**: Jupiter's planetary symbol, Hebrew letter Heth, Mars' planetary symbol, Hebrew letter Gimel, Chesed's blue color, and Geburah's red color.

As a visual representation, consider the sigil to consist of two interlocked triangles - one blue and one red - forming a hexagonal star enveloped by a hexagonal border with the esoteric attributes of Chesed and Geburah inscribed at each corner. The resulting sigil symbolizes the harmonious fusion of mercy and severity, displaying their individual characteristics while embodying their combined energies within the overall structure of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.
