Knowledge Challenge: Analyze the multidimensional influences of the Abyss' recurring motif as a void bridging creation and destruction on occultism, spiritual development, and metaphysical understanding, scrutinize the implications of crossing the Abyss on the aspirant's personal evolution, and discuss potential pitfalls they may face through this perilous journey.

Thorough Answer: 

To address this knowledge challenge, we will begin by identifying the recurring motif of the Abyss and its representation as a void that bridges between creation and destruction. We will then proceed to analyze its multidimensional influences on occultism, spiritual development, and metaphysical understanding, scrutinize the implications of crossing the Abyss on an aspirant's personal evolution, and discuss potential pitfalls that one may face through this perilous journey.

The Abyss is a concept found across various esoteric traditions, often symbolized as a vast and unfathomable void—an empty space—acting as the borderline between reality and the unknown. In the context of creation and destruction, the Abyss is situated in that delicate equilibrium where existence can dissolve into nonexistence and vice versa. This inherently unstable and chaotic nature of the Abyss plays a crucial role in many occult and mystical teachings as a challenge which an aspirant must confront in their spiritual journey. When crossing the Abyss, an adept may either experience an epiphany leading to enlightenment or face annihilation.

In occultism, the Abyss has been a pervasive concept serving multiple interpretations and applications. One such illustration is in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, where it acts as an intermediary between the supernal triad (Kether, Chokhmah, and Binah) and the lower sephiroth, reflecting the separation between the divine and terrestrial realms. This symbolic nature of the Abyss signifies the inherent limitation of human understanding and encourages aspirants to develop spiritual tools and practices to probe the depths of the unknown.

From a spiritual development perspective, facing the Abyss is often described as the 'Dark Night of the Soul,' an initiatory phase in which one must confront their deepest fears, doubts, and uncertainties, stripping away any remnants of preconceived notions and beliefs. This process pushes the aspirant to embrace a renewed sense of humility, intuition, and wisdom.

The metaphysical understanding of the Abyss involves acknowledging and embracing the ever-present dualism that permeates existence, such as the juxtaposition of consciousness and unconsciousness, matter and spirit, or order and chaos. By crossing the Abyss, one gains insight into the unity underlying these apparent dichotomies, fostering a more comprehensive grasp of reality's nuances and subtleties.

Despite its potential for personal evolution, crossing the Abyss is riddled with pitfalls. An aspirant may be prone to delusions of grandeur or divine entitlement, which can lead to egotism, dogmatism, and ultimately self-destruction. Furthermore, the process exacts a psychological toll on the individual, with the likelihood of experiencing confusion, despair, and ultimately the potential dissolution of their ego or sense of self.

In conclusion, the recurring motif of the Abyss as a void bridging creation and destruction holds immense significance in the realms of occultism, spiritual development, and metaphysical understanding. As an existential frontier, it presents both an opportunity for profound personal transformation and a perilous challenge fraught with pitfalls. Consequently, the aspirant must be mindful of the hazards while venturing across the Abyss, aiming to approach the passage with humility, wisdom, and perseverance in order to achieve a deeper understanding and connection with the hidden dimensions of reality.
