## The Rite of the Ecstatic Nexus

Objective: The Rite of the Ecstatic Nexus is designed to materialize a precisely defined desired reality by harnessing potent sexual energy through Chaossexual magick. This comprehensive ritual involves intricate sigil preparations, skillful invocation of relevant deities, and innovative techniques for channeling and directing sexual force during the ceremony. Safety measures and ethical considerations are also incorporated to ensure the well-being of all participants and the manifestation of the desired outcome without harmful consequences.

Preparation and Required Materials:

1. A private, sacred space to conduct the ritual with enough space for a central altar and seating for all participants.
2. Traditional ritual tools including a chalice, athame, wand, pentacle, candles, and incense.
3. Sigil materials such as parchment, ink, and a writing implement.
4. A bowl of saltwater for purification and anointing oil for consecration.
5. Comfortable and minimal clothing or ritual garb for all participants.
6. Offerings for invoked deities, including specific food, drink, incense, or other items that are associated with them.

Sigil Creation:

1. Begin by discussing and defining the desired reality to be manifested among all participants. Clarity and specificity are necessary. Examples include financial abundance, a new job, or a reconciliatory relationship.
2. Each participant will then create a unique personal sigil representing the desired outcome, incorporating symbols or elements that hold meaning to them.
3. Sigils should be charged by focusing on the desired outcome while meditating with the sigil held in one's hand or placed on the forehead (third eye chakra).

Cleansing and Purification:

1. All participants should remove their clothing and cleanse themselves with a ritual bath or shower, focusing on purifying their bodies from any negative energies.
2. Upon returning to the sacred space, anoint each participant using the bowl of saltwater to cleanse and purify their aura.

Invocation of Deities:

1. Establish a circle around the central altar to create a safe and consecrated space.
2. Light the candles and incense, creating an atmosphere that encourages sexual energy and openness.
3. Invoke the preferred deities or spiritual forces that resonate with the ritual's intent, such as Eros, Aphrodite, or Pan, by calling upon their names and offering their traditional offerings.
4. Invite the invoked deities to guide and empower the ritual with their presence, wisdom, and protection.

Ritual Performance:

1. Have all participants comfortably seated in a circle around the altar.
2. Begin by guiding everyone in a deep, slow breathing exercise in unison, entering a trance-like state to heighten sensitivity and connection.
3. Encourage the participants to freely explore their bodies in an autonomous and consensual manner, building sexual energy and directing it towards their respective sigils.
4. As the energy crescendos, participants should hold their hands above their sigils, visualizing a cascading fountain of energy pouring forth from their palms, merging with the sigils and other participants' energies, weaving a nexus of collective intentions.
5. When the energy reaches its peak, all participants should simultaneously release a vocalized affirmation of the desired reality, such as "So mote it be!"

Closure and Aftercare:

1. Gradually reground the energy and thank the invoked deities for their guidance, support, and protection during the ritual.
2. Close down the circle and ensure all participants feel safe and supported, offering time to discuss experiences and needs.
3. Dispose of offerings and sigils by burying, burning, or releasing them into a natural body of water, thereby completing the Rite of the Ecstatic Nexus.
4. Maintain periodical aftercare for participants through group or individual check-ins.

Safety Measures and Ethical Considerations:

1. Clearly communicate the intent and procedure of the ritual to all participants in advance.
2. Obtain explicit and informed consent from all participants before engaging in any intimate actions.
3. Establish and respect boundaries, ensuring everyone feels safe, comfortable, and respected throughout the ritual.
4. Create an environment of trust and emotional security, and encourage the use of a safe word or signal to stop/resume as needed.
5. Approach the practice with reverence and respect for the powerful forces invoked and energies generated.
