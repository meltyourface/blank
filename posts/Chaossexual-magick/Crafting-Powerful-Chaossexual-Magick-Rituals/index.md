In order to create a unique working of Chaossexual Magick, we need to understand the core principles of both Chaos Magick and Sexual Magick, as well as their connections to Sigil Magick. This will facilitate combining these seemingly divergent paths into a powerful synthesis that can be utilized for various purposes, from personal transformation to manifesting specific intentions.

Firstly, let's deconstruct the foundational elements of Chaos Magick and Sexual Magick and their relation to Sigil Magick.

Chaos Magick:
1. **Paradigm Shifting**: Chaos Magicians intentionally alter their belief systems, also known as "paradigms," to efficiently perform magick within those frameworks.
2. **Gnosis**: A state of no-mind or altered consciousness induced to perform effective magick.
3. **Pragmatism**: Chaos Magick is mostly result-oriented, focusing on obtaining desired results rather than adhering to strict traditional structures.

Sexual Magick:
1. **Sex as a Sacred Act**: Sexual Magick treats sexuality as a powerful manifestation of life force or divine energy.
2. **Transmutation of Sexual Energy**: Sexual arousal and orgasm are purposely cultivated, transformed, and channeled towards specific purposes, ranging from personal insight to manifesting specific goals.
3. **Union of Opposites**: The interplay between polarities, such as masculine and feminine energies, is often of great importance in Sexual Magick.

Sigil Magick:
1. **Symbolic Representation**: Sigils are glyphs or symbols encoding the magician's intention, created through various methods, such as the Spare Method, pictorial, alphabet of desire, etc.
2. **Charging the Sigil**: The sigil is infused with energy through different processes like meditation, visualization, and especially gnosis.
3. **Activation and Release**: Once charged, the sigil is "activated" or "cast" by intentionally forgetting its meaning, allowing the intention to manifest unconsciously.

Now that we understand the core principles of each practice and their interrelation, let's elucidate the steps to create a Chaossexual Magick working:
**Step 1**: Establishing Intent
Determine your specific intent or desire you wish to manifest or actualize through the working.
**Step 2**: Paradigm Shifting
Adopt a belief framework that is conducive to viewing sex as sacred and synergistic with magick. This could come from a variety of systems, such as Tantra, Western Esotericism, or even a self-created system of symbols and beliefs.
**Step 3**: Designing the Ritual
Develop a ritual or procedure that incorporates aspects of both Chaos Magick (such as gnosis or freeform structure) and Sexual Magick (arousal, union, or other sex-related elements). This can be as elaborate or simple as desired.
**Step 4**: Sigil Creation
Incorporate your intention within a sigil using your preferred sigil creation method. Place the sigil within the context of the ritual (e.g., on an altar or a focus point for visualization).
**Step 5**: Performing the Ritual
Engage in the ritual, with particular attention paid to reaching a state of gnosis. This could be induced through sexual arousal, orgasm, or other techniques like sensory deprivation, chaos mantras, etc.
**Step 6**: Transmutation and Projection of Sexual Energy
As you reach the climax of the ritual, consciously transmute and project the sexual energy built up within yourself towards the sigil, effectively "charging" it with the generated energy.
**Step 7**: Activation and Release
Once the sigil is charged, enter the stage of activation and release, letting go of your conscious attachment to the intention and allowing the Chaossexual Magick to work on an unconscious or subtle level.
**Step 8**: Banishing and Grounding
Post-ritual, perform a banishing technique to clear the space and residual energies. Rebalance and ground yourself.

In conclusion, combining the principles of Chaos Magick and Sexual Magick allows for the creation of a unique Chaossexual Magick working. This working taps into the power of paradigm shifting, gnosis, and the sacred nature of sexual energy to manifest the magician's intention. Sigil Magick is a crucial element, serving as the symbolic focus in which the generated energy is directed.

Through embracing the synergistic power of Chaos Magick, Sexual Magick, and Sigil Magick, a practitioner can create potent workings that facilitate personal growth, healing, and the realization of their intentions.
