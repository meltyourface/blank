description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Gods of Time, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a series of elaborate ceremonies to summon the four Eternal Temporal Deities representing each season within the realm of the Gods of Time. Ensure that each ritual incorporates unique, season-specific symbols, offerings, and incantations that resonate with the corresponding deity's energies. Lay out the intricate steps, invocations, and requisite tools required for the faithful to successfully commune with these divine entities. Additionally, describe how the alignment of celestial bodies during each seasonal shift bolsters the potency of these rituals, granting supplicants access to arcane temporal wisdom and blessings.
