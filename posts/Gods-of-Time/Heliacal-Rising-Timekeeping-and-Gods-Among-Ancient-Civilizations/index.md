In order to provide a comprehensive response to the knowledge challenge, let us break down the question into parts: (1) understanding the concept of Heliacal Rising, (2) exploring the connection between Heliacal Rising and gods of time in various cultures, and (3) analyzing the influence of these connections on the perception of time in ancient civilizations.

1. Concept of Heliacal Rising

Heliacal Rising refers to the first appearance of a celestial object, particularly a star, just before the break of dawn, after having been invisible for a length of time due to its proximity with the Sun. This event occurs annually and has been closely observed since ancient times as a marker of time, particularly the beginning of a new year or key agricultural seasons.

2. Connections between Heliacal Rising and gods of time in various cultures

The Heliacal Rising of celestial objects, such as stars and planets, was associated with gods of time in various cultures, being revered as divine symbols representing the cycle of life, time, and prosperity. Drawing parallels between different civilizations:

A. Egyptian Mythology: The Heliacal Rising of Sirius (known as Sothis in ancient Egypt) was of great significance. Sirius was linked to the goddess Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris, who was the god of the afterlife, resurrection, and fertility. The appearance of Sirius just before dawn denoted the beginning of the annual Nile flood, which was the source of fertility and abundance in the life of ancient Egyptians. This event marked the start of the Egyptian calendar year and was essential to their agricultural cycles.

B. Mesopotamian Culture: The Heliacal Rising of the star cluster Pleiades (known as Mul.Mul or "the star of stars" in Babylonian astronomy) held great importance in Mesopotamian mythology. As the rising of Pleiades marked the beginning of the agricultural year, this event was associated with the Sumerian deities Enlil, the god of wind, and Enki, the god of water and wisdom. It was seen the time when the balance was achieved between light and dark, thus connecting the cycle of life with the flow of time.

C. Mayan Civilization: In Mesoamerican cultures, the planet Venus played a major role. The Heliacal Rising of Venus had a strong association with various gods and aspects of time in Mayan mythology. Venus's appearance was often connected with the gods Kukulkan (the Feathered Serpent) and Quetzalcoatl. Its cycle symbolized life, death, and rebirth and served as an organizing principle for the Mayan understanding of time, as evidenced by the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.

3. Influence on the perception of time by ancient civilizations

The Heliacal Rising of celestial objects and its connection to gods of time deeply influenced the perception of time and worldview by ancient civilizations. This manifested in various aspects, such as:

A. Calendars: Many ancient cultures developed their calendars based on the Heliacal Rising of their revered celestial bodies. For example, the Egyptian calendar began with the rising of Sirius, and the Mayan Long Count calendar followed the cycles of Venus.

B. Agricultural cycles: The rising of celestial bodies marked seasonal changes that signaled crucial agricultural events, such as planting and harvesting. This connected the gods of time to the life-sustaining cycles of nature, influencing the society's agricultural activities and economy.

C. Symbolism: The cycle of Heliacal Rising represented the life-death-rebirth cycle, shaping cultural beliefs about time, life, and afterlife. This symbolism integrated gods of time into the essential fabric of reality, permeating rituals, tales, and religious practices.

D. Celestial events as omens: Heliacal Rising events were at times interpreted as omens or prophetic signs by ancient civilizations. The gods' representation in these events influenced how celestial occurrences were linked to human affairs, predicting a range of future events â€“ both positive and negative (e.g., prosperity or calamity).

In summary, the Heliacal Rising serves as a crucial phenomenon connecting gods of time in various cultures and influencing the perception of time by ancient civilizations. By examining the parallels between Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Mayan mythologies, it is evident that the Heliacal Rising of celestial bodies played a significant role in shaping calendars, agricultural cycles, symbolism, and beliefs in omens, shaping the very foundations of these societies.
