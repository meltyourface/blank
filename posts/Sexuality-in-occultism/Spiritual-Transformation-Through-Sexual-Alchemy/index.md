In responding to this knowledge challenge, we will delve into the complex interconnections between the sacred union, the alchemical concept of the "coniunctio oppositorum," and the traditional symbolism of the serpent in the context of sexuality in occultism. First, we will explore each of these elements individually before analyzing their interconnections and finally, proposing how they can harmoniously amplify an initiate's path to invoke spiritual awakening and transformation. 

1. The Sacred Union:
The sacred union, also known as the hieros gamos or sacred marriage, is an essential tenet in both esoteric and mystery traditions. This union represents the merging of dualistic principles, such as masculine and feminine, light and dark, and consciousness and unconsciousness to achieve a higher state of being and spiritual enlightenment. Sacred unions appear in many ancient mythologies - the union between Shiva and Shakti in Hinduism, Christ and Sophia in Gnosticism, and Osiris and Isis in Egyptian mythology.

2. Coniunctio Oppositorum:
The concept of "coniunctio oppositorum," Latin for "union of opposites," is a fundamental idea in alchemy, representing the process of spiritual transformation. This alchemical marriage entails the dissolution and subsequent synthesis of opposing principles, such as the masculine (Sol) and feminine (Luna), to form a unified, transcendent state. This process is commonly represented by the image of the "Rebis," a hermaphroditic figure embodying both masculine and feminine traits. The notion of "coniunctio oppositorum" is prevalent in other esoteric traditions such as Taoism (Yin and Yang) and Kabbalah (the harmonizing of Tiferet with Malkuth).

3. Serpent symbolism:
The serpent is a recurring motif in occultism, often representing wisdom, transformation, and enlightenment. In various spiritual traditions, the serpent appears as the symbol of Kundalini, the primal energy coiled at the base of the spine; this energy, once awakened, ascends through the chakras, leading to expanded states of consciousness. Additionally, the serpent is associated with the Ouroboros, an alchemical symbol representing the cyclical nature of existence and the continuous interplay between creation and dissolution.

Now, let's examine the interconnections between these elements concerning sexuality in occultism:

The sacred union, coniunctio oppositorum, and serpent symbolism all share a common thread: the transformative potential of sexuality. In sacred sexual practices, the act unites masculine and feminine principles, embodying the divine, and bringing about spiritual enlightenment. This union transforms the individual and leads to the realization of the self - a reintegration into the primordial whole.

Sexuality is also integral to the concept of coniunctio oppositorum, wherein the masculine (solar) and feminine (lunar) energies merge, creating a spiritual "child" that transcends duality. The sacred union also shares similarities with the awakening of Kundalini, as both processes depend upon the harmonious integration of opposites and the balancing of energetic polarities. The serpent is a symbol of this transformative process, embodying the potency of sexuality in the awakening of higher consciousness.

Finally, let us consider how these elements might harmoniously amplify an initiate's path to awakening and spiritual transformation:

1. Integration of Internal polarities:
An initiate must strive to achieve balance within themselves, integrating their masculine and feminine aspects, light and dark, and conscious and unconscious realms. This work of unification enables one to access the transformative power of the sacred union and coniunctio oppositorum, forgoing duality and transcending the limitations of the ego.

2. Cultivation of sacred sexuality:
By approaching sexuality with reverence and spiritual intent, an initiate can harness the ecstatic energy generated in sacred union to accelerate their spiritual growth. Engaging in conscious, consensual, and intentionally ritualized sexual practices can serve as a powerful tool in one's path towards enlightenment.

3. Kundalini awakening:
The initiate should work on activating their Kundalini energy through consistent practices such as meditation, yoga, and energy work. By cultivating the rise of the serpent energy, the initiate can experience heightened states of consciousness and improve their understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.

In conclusion, the sacred union, coniunctio oppositorum, and serpent symbolism are deeply interwoven in the context of sexuality in occultism, offering powerful avenues for spiritual awakening and transformation. By diligently working to integrate internal polarities, cultivating sacred sexuality, and awakening the Kundalini energy, an initiate can harmoniously amplify their path to enlightenment.
