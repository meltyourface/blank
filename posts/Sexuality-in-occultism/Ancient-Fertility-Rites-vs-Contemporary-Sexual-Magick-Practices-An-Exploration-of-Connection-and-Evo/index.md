The connection between ancient fertility rites and contemporary sexual magical practices is an area of deep intrigue in the study of occultism. Fertility rites, such as the rites of Dionysus and the Great Rite, represent the desire to celebrate and harness the creative powers of sexuality within a spiritual and ritualistic context. Contemporary sexual magical practices like tantra, karezza, and Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O) rituals serve to further establish this connection and build upon the fundamental principles rooted in ancient practices. 

Ancient fertility rites, such as those of Dionysus, emphasized the use of wine, music, and dance to induce a state of ecstasy and altered consciousness. Dionysus was the Greek god of wine, fertility, and divine madness. His rites were marked by enthusiastic revelry and an embrace of the sensual, uninhibited side of human nature. The Great Rite, primarily associated with Wiccan practices, symbolizes the union of the god and goddess, often represented by the athame (ceremonial knife) and the chalice (cup). The act of sexual intercourse is heavily implied, though rarely enacted.

Contemporary sexual magical practices, on the other hand, take a more focused approach to the application of sexuality within spiritual and magical contexts. Tantra emphasizes the union of opposites and the integration of masculine and feminine energies. Tantra practices aim to balance and align these energies in pursuit of spiritual transcendence and elevated consciousness. Karezza, derived from Italian "carezza" meaning "caress", is a form of non-orgasmic sex that focuses on cultivating intimacy, connection, and energy exchange between partners. 

The O.T.O.'s Ordo Templi Orientis rituals incorporate elements of sex magic and draw from the teachings of Aleister Crowley, an influential figure in the world of occultism. Crowley, who sought to synthesize various spiritual and magical traditions, developed the practice of sex magic as a means of harnessing and directing sexual energy towards specific intentions or goals. O.T.O rituals often involve the invocation of deities and the wielding of potent sexual energy to create transformative and empowering experiences for the practitioners.

There are a few overarching similarities between these ancient and contemporary practices:

1. The recognition of sexuality as a potent force in human life, capable of having a profound impact on the spiritual, emotional, and physical aspects of one's existence.
2. The ritualization of sexual acts, with an emphasis on creating sacred and intentional spaces to facilitate transformative experiences.
3. The underlying belief in the power of sexual energy as a means to connect with the divine and enact magical intentions.

The differences in these practices lie mainly in their specific aims, methods, and cultural contexts, which have evolved and adapted over time. For example, ancient fertility rites were often embedded in broader cultural practices that sought to ensure the fertility of the land, people, and animals, whereas contemporary practices like O.T.O rituals may be more narrowly focused on personal transformation and the attainment of specific magical or spiritual goals.

In contemporary occult circles, these sacred sexual practices continue to be adapted and integrated into the personal practices of individual practitioners and within larger spiritual movements. The resurgence of interest in ancient pagan traditions, goddess worship, and alternative spiritualities has resulted in a revival and reintegration of sexual magical practices within modern esoteric contexts.

In conclusion, the intricate relationship between ancient fertility rites and contemporary sexual magical practices highlights the enduring fascination with and reverence for the divine power of sexuality within the realm of esoteric and occult traditions. By investigating the similarities, differences, and adaptations of these practices, we can better understand their historical evolution and philosophical underpinnings, gaining valuable insights into the role of sexuality within the broader scope of human spiritual and magical pursuits.
