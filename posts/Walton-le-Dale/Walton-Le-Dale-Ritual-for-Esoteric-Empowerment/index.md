## The Whispering Ribble Convergence

**Objective**: To harmonize with the esoteric energies of Walton le Dale and unlock its hidden truths by combining ancient knowledge and local mythos.

Preliminary Preparations:

1. Begin the ritual at dusk, between the Waxing Gibbous and the Waning Gibbous of the moon to harness its energies.
2. ****Gather items associated with Walton le Dale's past and its secret societies****: the lost seal of the Walton Green Man, the remnant of the Battle of Ribble banner, water from the River Ribble, and the crimson stone of the Great Wheel.
3. Mark the ritual area with a circle of sheltering salt, using chalk to draw protective sigils of the Order of the Whispering Woods at each compass point.
4. Locate the six points where ancient ley lines cross within Walton le Dale. These will function as anchor points for the ritual's energy flow.

The High Serpent Conclave:
1. Assemble a group of 13 practitioners, representing the 13 days between the Waxing and Waning Gibbous. Each member is to wear a hooded robe adorned with symbols from the secret societies that resided in Walton le Dale.
2. Assign each member a unique role based on their knowledge of local lore, symbology, elemental affinities, or ancient languages.
3. Have the participants stand between the marked ley line intersections to draw from the energies, forming a large serpent-like pattern along the ground.

Invocation of the Walton Green Man:
1. Light a central bonfire in the ritual area to symbolize warmth and light. Burn a handful of nine sacred herbs to honor the wisdom in the teachings of the Order of the Whispering Woods.
2. Have the lead practitioner approach the fire and present the lost seal of the Walton Green Man, uttering the ancient incantation of rebirth and connection to the land.
3. Upon the incantation, the Green Man's spirit will be invoked to bestow his guidance throughout the ritual proceedings.

The Battle of Ribble Communion:
1. Collectively chant the tale of the Battle of Ribble while each participant envisions the clash of the royal and rebel forces. By doing so, a powerful connection to the past will be established.
2. Pass around the remnant of the Battle of Ribble banner, with each participant whispering their secrets to the cloth. This act represents the transience of earthly struggles.
3. Return the banner to the central fire and lay it upon the flames. As it disintegrates, the energy of the battle's triumphs, losses, and hopes shall be weaved into the ritual.

The Great Wheel's Echo:
1. Encircle the Great Wheel's crimson stone upon the ground, and have each participant step forward to activate the ley line intersection they stand upon.
2. Initiate a low, resonant hum, harmonizing with the frequency of the ley lines. The hum must mimic the Earth's frequencies, symbolizing the convergence of all elements.
3. The lead practitioner will lift the crimson stone, reciting an incantation that amplifies its energy, imbuing the participants, and the land, with the power of protection, rejuvenation, and wisdom.

The Ribble Waters Blessing:
1. Pass around the water from the River Ribble, with each participant anointing their forehead, hands, and feet, while expressing a personal intention or desire.
2. Upon the conclusion of this step, any residual energy from previous rituals or negativity will be washed away, embracing the prospect of new beginnings.

Closing of the Ritual:
1. Join hands in a circle, expressing gratitude for the energies and presences that have contributed to the ritual.
2. Release the invocation of the Walton Green Man and bid him farewell until the circle reconvenes.

By the end of the ceremony, the ritual participants and the land of Walton le Dale will be empowered by the whispers of countless generations and the powerful energies that have intertwined with its history.
