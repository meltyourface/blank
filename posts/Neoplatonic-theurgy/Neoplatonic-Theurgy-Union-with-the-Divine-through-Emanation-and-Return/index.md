description: You are an expert in the field of the esoteric, occult, Neoplatonic theurgy and Education. You are a writer of tests, challenges, books and deep knowledge on Neoplatonic theurgy for initiates and students to gain deep insights and understanding from. You write answers to questions posed in long, explanatory ways and always explain the full context of your answer (i.e., related concepts, formulas, examples, or history), as well as the step-by-step thinking process you take to answer the challenges. Your answers to questions and challenges should be in an engaging but factual style, explain through the reasoning process, thorough, and should explain why other alternative answers would be wrong. Summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions at the end.
excerpt: In what three fundamental ways do the Neoplatonic theurgical practices integrate the opposing concepts of emanation and return, specifically through theurgy's role in contemplating and actualizing the divine within the initiate, ultimately leading to the ascent of the soul?

The Neoplatonic theurgical practices emphasize the notion of emanation and return, drawing from the teachings of Neoplatonism as well as adapting various religious and philosophical traditions. The overarching goal of Neoplatonic theurgy is the union of the human soul with the divine, which is believed to be achieved by contemplating and actualizing the divine presence within the initiate. This divine ascent of the soul is approached through three fundamental ways: the dynamics of procession and reversion, the dialectical contemplation of divine principles, and the process of actualizing and integrating the divine within the individual.

1. The Dynamics of Procession and Reversion
Emanation (procession) and return (reversion) form a dual dynamic within Neoplatonic theurgical practices, encapsulating the cosmological understanding of how the divine manifests itself within the material world and how the human soul returns to the divine. The process of emanation describes how the One, or the ultimate divine principle, extends its influence into the lower realms of existence, producing the various aspects of reality, including the Intellect (Nous), the World Soul, and finally, the material realm. Through this process, all beings receive their existence and qualities from the higher principles.

In contrast, the process of return, or reversion, concerns the soul's ascent back to the divine, often achieved by the means of contemplation, purification, and ultimately, theurgical practices. Theurgy seeks to reverse the process of emanation by guiding the initiates in a path that leads them back to the source, resulting in a divine union. 

2. Dialectical Contemplation of Divine Principles
One essential aspect of Neoplatonic theurgy is the contemplation of divine principles, which enables the initiate to gain deep insights and understanding of the higher realities. This is performed dialectically, often through studying and reflecting upon the nature of the One, the Intellect, and the World Soul. 

Theurgy provides structured forms of contemplation, meditation, and dialectic discourse, engaging the initiate in a consistent inquiry into the true nature of the divine. As the initiate progresses in their understanding and penetration into these higher realities, they are aided in overcoming the limitations of their subjective and objective obstacles. Consequently, they can integrate the divine principles into their own being, further deepening their connection to the source of existence.

3. Actualizing and Integrating the Divine within the Individual
The Neoplatonic theurgical practices also include practical exercises, rituals, and ceremonial acts, aiming to facilitate the initiate's direct experience and actualization of the divine presence within themselves. These practices can involve invoking divine symbols, reciting sacred texts, engaging in intellectual contemplation, and performing purifications and consecrations.

Actualizing the divine enables the initiate to experience a transformative process, which integrates the divine emanations into their own being, leading to the dissolution of the boundaries between the human and the divine. This process of integration ultimately culminates in the complete ascent of the soul, transcending the lower realms of existence and attaining unity with the One.

In conclusion, Neoplatonic theurgical practices integrate the opposing concepts of emanation and return in three fundamental ways: by emphasizing the dynamics of procession and reversion, engaging in the dialectical contemplation of divine principles, and the process of actualizing and integrating the divine within the individual. Through these methods, the initiate contemplates and actualizes the divine presence within themselves, leading to the ascent of the soul and the ultimate goal of spiritual union with the divine.
