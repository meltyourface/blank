1. Hierarchy and relationship between the One, the Intellect (Nous), and the World Soul:

Porphyry, in his "Sententiae," presents a hierarchical view of the divine emanations, emanating from the One as the ultimate source and principle of all beings. The Intellect (Nous) emanates from the One and serves as the principle of thought. From the Intellect, the World Soul emanates, connecting the spiritual and material realms. According to Porphyry, the World Soul is indivisible and transcends individual souls.

Iamblichus, in his work "De Mysteriis," places greater emphasis on the complexity and multiplicity of divine emanations beyond the triad of the One, Intellect, and World Soul. He posits intermediary divine entities, known as the Gods, Demi-Gods, and Heroes, which provide a bridge for the theurgist to ascend through the hierarchy of being. Despite these differences, Iamblichus also acknowledges the emanations flowing from the One and recognizes the importance of the Intellect and World Soul in the Neoplatonic hierarchy.

2. Ritual practice and theurgical rites in achieving enlightenment and divine union:

Porphyry adopts a more intellectual and contemplative approach to achieving enlightenment and divine union. He believes in the efficacy of philosophy and mental purification in assisting the soul's ascent to the divine. For Porphyry, theurgical rites and rituals can be used as a means to purify the soul, but they are ultimately lower and less powerful than intellectual pursuits.

In contrast, Iamblichus emphasizes the crucial role of rituals and theurgical rites in achieving divine union. He contends that theurgic operations have the ability to draw down divine powers, aligning the practitioner with higher spiritual realities. Iamblichus stresses the importance of theurgy as an active, participatory engagement with the divine hierarchy, arguing that spiritual ascent is facilitated through the use of symbols, rituals, and divine intermediaries.

3. Impact and influence on the development of Neoplatonic theurgical thought and contemporary esoteric practices:

Porphyry's more rational and philosophical approach to Neoplatonic theurgy had a significant influence on later Neoplatonic schools, as his emphasis on intellectual contemplation resonated with philosophers and scholars alike. His perspective has left a lasting impact on Western philosophy, particularly in the way it regards the intellect and human rationality.

Iamblichus' theurgical ideas and practice-oriented perspective strongly influenced subsequent esoteric and occult traditions, such as Hermeticism, Renaissance magic, and modern Western occult practices. His assertion of the importance of divine intermediaries, symbols, and rituals in engaging with spiritual realities has provided a foundation for contemporary esoteric systems that integrate both philosophical reflection and practical ritual work.

In examining both Porphyry and Iamblichus' perspectives on divine emanations within the framework of Neoplatonic theurgy, one can appreciate the richness and nuance of their thoughts on the nature of reality, spiritual growth, and the relationship between human beings and the divine. Though they differ on the role of ritual practice and the hierarchy of emanations, their ideas have greatly influenced the course of Neoplatonic theurgical thought, esotericism, and occult traditions to the present day.
