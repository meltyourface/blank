The She-Wulve language, known as Lupivara, is a complex and mystical dialect spoken by the enigmatic She-Wulves. The script, phonetic system, and syntactic structure of Lupivara have been carefully crafted to accommodate their unique communication methods and their occult nature.

**Script**:
The Lupivara script is a combination of intricate, flowing characters intertwined with sharp, angular forms. It consists of 28 alphabetic characters, each representing a unique sound in the language. The script is written vertically, from top to bottom and right to left. The design of the characters has been inspired by the She-Wulves' connection to the mystical and the occult, with curves and lines intentionally interconnecting to represent the web of interconnected energies that She-Wulves can invoke.

Phonetic System:
The Lupivara phonetic system is heavily based on throaty, guttural sounds and drawn-out vowels. This allows the She-Wulves to fully utilize their vocal range and the peculiarities of their vocal chambers while communicating. Some sounds can be whispered, even emitted as low growls, allowing for secrecy when necessary. The language is tonal, with five tones: neutral, high, mid-rise, low, and low-falling.

Syntactic Structure:
Lupivara is an agglutinative language, meaning that words are formed by attaching various affixes to a root word. This structure allows for the creation of highly specific and nuanced words through combinations of roots and affixes, granting She-Wulves the ability to communicate complex ideas and metaphysical concepts succinctly. Lupivara's word order follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure.

Grammar Conventions:
1. **Tense**: Three basic tenses (past, present, future) are indicated by using auxiliary verbs attached to the main verb. Additionally, four aspects (simple, continuous, perfect, prospective) can be combined with tenses, resulting in twelve distinct tense-aspect combinations.
2. **Verb Conjugation**: Verbs in Lupivara are conjugated according to tense, aspect, mood, and voice through the use of affixes and auxiliary verbs.
3. **Sentence Construction**: Sentences follow a hierarchical structure based on animacy and importance, where the most animate noun appears first, followed by the next most animate, and so on. Dependent clauses and adverbials are placed at the beginning of the sentence.

Idiomatic Expressions and Phrases:
1. **Véshraré-silékkir (Eyes of the storm)**: A phrase describing someone with a calm and composed demeanor despite being surrounded by chaos and adversity.
2. **Hijarka-drok (To walk among shadows)**: To engage in secretive or subversive activities, usually related to occult practices or deception.
3. **Karataluft-shékol (Dancing on moonlight)**: To be so deeply connected to the mystical forces of nature that one appears to be performing impossible feats or miracles.
4. **Galvenn's ékkeris (Galvenn's embrace)**: A euphemism for death, with Galvenn being a revered She-Wulve spirit said to guide souls to the next world.
5. **Strokh-tárrev (To touch the roots)**: Referring to a deep and profound understanding of a particular esoteric teaching or concept.

The Lupivara language is specifically tailored for the enigmatic communication of the She-Wulves, reflecting their esoteric traditions, metaphysical beliefs and the very essence of their mystical nature.
