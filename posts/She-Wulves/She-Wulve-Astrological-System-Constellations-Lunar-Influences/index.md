In order to create an intricately detailed She-Wulve astrological system, it is essential to first establish the foundational components: constellations, a lunar calendar, and the prophetic influences on She-Wulve behavior, hunts, and rituals. The following constitutes a comprehensive and intricate She-Wulve astrological system.

The She-Wulve Constellations:

1. Lupus Sanguinis (The Blood Wolf) - representing aggression, vitality, and the warrior spirit
2. Ignis Cauda (The Fire Tail) - symbolizing change, transformation, and renewal
3. Lunaris Cervus (The Moon Stag) - embodying wisdom, intuition, and the nurturing spirit
4. Ventus Alas (The Wind Wing) - expressing freedom, exploration, and unrestrained movement
5. Terra Garra (The Earth Claw) - representing grounding, stability, and resilience
6. Aquae Spiritus (The Water Spirit) - symbolizing emotions, healing, and cleansing energy

The She-Wulve Lunar Calendar:

The She-Wulve lunar calendar follows the 29.5-day lunar cycle and is divided into four primary phases: New Moon, Waxing Moon, Full Moon, and Waning Moon. The moon holds significant influence over the She-Wulves throughout its monthly cycle.

1. New Moon - a time for new beginnings, fresh starts, and rejuvenation
2. Waxing Moon - a period of growth, learning, and building momentum
3. Full Moon - the peak of energy and a heightened sense of She-Wulve powers
4. Waning Moon - a phase for reflection, rest, and release of what no longer serves the She-Wulves

The Prophetic Influences and Relationships with She-Wulve Archetypes:

During each lunar phase, the alignment of the constellations with the moon may influence the behaviors, hunts, and rituals of the She-Wulves. The relationship between the constellations and specific She-Wulve character archetypes will further enrich the complexity and significance of the astrological system.

1. Lupus Sanguinis - during the vigorous Waxing Moon phase, the Blood Wolf constellation aligns with the Warrior She-Wulve, promoting ferocity, determination, and focus for successful hunts.

2. Ignis Cauda - aligned with the Full Moon, the Fire Tail bolsters the Rebirth She-Wulve. This archetype symbolizes shedding of old skin and embracing new beginnings while driving powerful transformation rituals.

3. Lunaris Cervus - intertwining with the Waning Moon's calming energy, the Moon Stag constellation complements the Sage She-Wulve, encouraging wisdom, spiritual guidance, and mentorship among She-Wulve communities.

4. Ventus Alas - as the wind of change sweeps through the Waxing Moon, the Wind Wing constellation enlivens the Explorer She-Wulve, instigating wanderlust, curiosity, and the expansion of territory through exploration.

5. Terra Garra - rooted in the grounding energy of the New Moon, the Earth Claw constellation anchors to the Guardian She-Wulve, deepening their role as the protectors and defenders of the pack.

6. Aquae Spiritus - during the introspective Waning Moon phase, the Water Spirit constellation resonates with the Healer She-Wulve, providing the emotional depth, clarity, and compassionate energy needed to restore well-being within the pack.

In conclusion, through the alignment of unique She-Wulve constellations and synchronization with the phases of the lunar calendar, a rich and intricate She-Wulve astrological system is established. This system offers both deep cultural connections and guidance for the diverse behaviors, hunts, and rituals observed within the She-Wulve communities.
