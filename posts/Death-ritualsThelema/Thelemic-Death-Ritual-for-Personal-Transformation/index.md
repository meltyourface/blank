Begin by finding a comfortable and quiet space where you can sit or lay down undisturbed. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling slowly. As you do this, feel your body begin to relax, releasing tension from your muscles and calming your mind.

Now envision a lush, green field, bathed in radiant sunlight. The sky above is clear and bright, providing warmth and illumination to the landscape below. Imagine yourself standing in this field, feeling the soft grass beneath your feet and the gentle breeze on your skin.

As your mind's eye scans the horizon, you identify a large, black marble doorframe without a door, standing alone amidst the verdant field. As you approach it, you see the symbols of the Death Tarot card inscribed upon the surface: a skeletal figure wearing a black cloak, holding a scythe aloft as it rides a white horse. You also observe the symbols of Alpha (Α) and Omega (Ω), representing the beginning and the end, or the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

Now, with the image of the doorframe in your mind, consider the symbology of Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, resurrection, and the underworld. Imagine his green, mummified figure wearing a tall, white crown with ostrich feathers attached on both sides. As you visualize Osiris beside the doorframe, recognize the representation of transformation and rebirth that he brings.

Gently allow the doorframe to open up in front of you, revealing a realm of glowing, ethereal light beyond. As you step through the threshold, feel yourself being cleansed and released from earthly attachments and energized with the power of transformation. You are now entering the realm of the infinite, where your soul can experience growth, change, and rebirth.

Allow your surroundings to dissolve into the shimmering, ethereal glow, experiencing a profound sense of connection with the universe and all living beings. Allow yourself to embrace the possibility of new beginnings, welcoming the transformative power of the Death Card and its Thelemic teachings.

As you continue to breathe deeply, feel the transformative energies of the Death Tarot card, the symbols of Osiris, and the afterlife's potential for rebirth, merging through your entire being. Picture these forces aligning your chakras, removing blockages, and balancing your energy centers, allowing your soul to soar free and unbound.

Now, slowly, begin to draw your consciousness back to your physical body, grounding yourself in the present moment. Take a few more deep breaths and, when you feel ready, gently open your eyes. Give yourself a moment to integrate the energies and experiences of the ritual before returning to your daily life.

You have now completed a Thelemic death ritual-inspired visualization for enhanced grounding and centering. You can return to this practice whenever you feel the need for personal transformation, renewal, or spiritual growth.
