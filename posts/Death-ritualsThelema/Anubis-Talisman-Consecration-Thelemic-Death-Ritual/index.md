Ceremonial Thelemic Death Ritual for the Consecration of an Anubis Talisman

1. Altar Setup:
The altar will be set up in the shape of a pyramid to represent Anubis' connection to the afterlife and the underworld. It should be placed in a room with little to no natural light, adorned with black and gold cloth to signify Anubisâ€™ power and royal status. The following items should be arranged on the altar:

  * A statue or image of Anubis, prominently displayed at the centerpiece. 
  * An offering bowl filled with a mixture of sacred herbs and earth from a burial site or graveyard, symbolizing the connection to the afterlife and Anubis' domain.
  * The Anubis talisman, placed at the feet of the Anubis statue, to be consecrated during the ritual.
  * The Unicursal Hexagram, representing Thelema's core beliefs and unity with Anubis.
  * The Book of the Law, opened to "Liber AL vel Legis" (Chapter 3) to signify Thelema's embrace of life, death, and transformation.
  * Ceremonial tools including an athame, wand, chalice, and censor.
  * A gold plate with offerings specific to Anubis, such as meat, onions, dark chocolate, or juniper berries.

2. Invocations and Prayers:
Begin the ritual by lighting incense and reciting the following invocations and prayers, integrating Thelemic and ancient Egyptian spiritual practices:

  * Start with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to cleanse the space and establish the right mindset.
  * Invoke Anubis with a declaration such as:
    "Anpu, Lord of the Sacred Land, Keeper of the Scales, we call upon You to consecrate this talisman, that it may serve as a bridge between the living and the dead, between the known and the unknown. So mote it be."
  * Recite the adoration to Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a key Thelemic deity, as a unifying invocation:
    "Unto Thee I burn incense, the smoke whereof shall reach unto the farthest corners of the earth. And Thou, Malachim, I invoke!"
  * Offer a traditional Egyptian prayer to Anubis:
    "Oh, Anubis, Guardian of the Dead, accept our offering of sustenance and guide our journey through the veil of darkness, that we may know the secrets of transformation and rebirth."

3. Ritual Performance:
The ritual should be performed following specific Thelemic laws and ancient Egyptian death customs, as outlined below:

  * Begin the ritual by summoning the four elements through the use of ceremonial tools (air/wand, water/chalice, fire/athame, earth/censor) while reciting the corresponding Thelemic elemental invocations.
  * Call upon Anubis, addressing Him as "Opener of the Way" and visualize the god entering the sacred space while focusing on the talisman to be consecrated.
  * Read aloud passages from "The Book of the Dead" (Papyrus of Ani) and "The Book of the Law" (Liber AL vel Legis) to evoke a sense of transition and emphasize the importance of the talisman in one's spiritual journey.
  * Place the talisman upon the offering plate and reverently present it to the statue of Anubis, reciting the following:
    "In the name of Anubis, Lord of the Sacred Land, by the power of the Unicursal Hexagram and the wisdom in the Book of the Law, I consecrate this talisman to aid me in the journey of life and death, transformation and rebirth."
  * Anoint the talisman with consecrated oil, representing Anubis' blessing and imbuing it with His divine power.

4. Closing the Ritual:
To express gratitude and create a lasting bond with Anubis and the consecrated talisman, follow these steps:

  * Offer a closing prayer of thanks to Anubis, such as:
    "Lord Anubis, Wielder of Life and Death, we thank You for Your guidance, protection, and power. May this consecrated talisman serve as a symbol of our bond and eternal connection."
  * Extinguish the incense and candles, symbolizing the end of the ritual and the return to the mundane world.
  * Carefully store the consecrated talisman on the person or in a vessel connected to the practitioner, maintaining the connection to Anubis' power.
  * Close the sacred space by banishing energies with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, ensuring the balance of energies and upholding the sanctity of the Thelemic death proceedings.

This Ceremonial Thelemic Death Ritual for the Consecration of an Anubis Talisman creates a powerful connection to the god Anubis and the realm of the dead, incorporating both Thelemic and ancient Egyptian practices for a profound spiritual experience.
