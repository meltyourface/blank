excerpt: Conduct a necromantic analysis on soil samples surrounding decomposed corpses to identify any trace occult energies or otherworldly residue, thus illuminating potential supernatural influences on the remains. Make sure to document soil types, any spiritual abnormalities, and employ the use of spectral detection equipment during the investigation.

Necromantic Analysis of Soil Samples Surrounding Decomposed Corpses

Objective:
To identify any trace occult energies or otherworldly residue in the soil samples surrounding decomposed corpses, thus illuminating potential supernatural influences on the remains. The analysis will involve documentation of soil types, spiritual abnormalities, and the use of spectral detection equipment.

Procedure:

1. Collection of Soil Samples:

a. Determine the location of the decomposed corpses and the areas of interest for the analysis.
b. Use a sterile spade or soil sampling device, ensuring the instrument is cleansed with a consecrated solution prior to use.
c. Collect multiple samples from various points around the remains, including beneath the corpse and at cardinal directions surrounding the body.

2. Preliminary Analysis:

a. Label each sample and record its collection point.
b. Examine each sample visually to determine the soil type (e.g., sandy, loamy, clay).
c. Note any irregularities, such as unusual coloring, texture, or foreign materials, as these may suggest supernatural influences.

3. Spectral Detection:

a. Employ a calibrated spectral detection device (e.g., an EMF meter, spiritual energy reader) to measure any latent energies.
b. Gently agitate each soil sample, then hold the device close to the sample, recording the readings as required.
c. Repeat this process for all samples and compare the results to uncover any anomalous readings that may indicate occult energies.

4. Detection of Spiritual Abnormalities:

a. Conduct a ritual invocation, summoning the assistance of spirits or entities knowledgeable in occult energies (take protective measures to ensure personal safety).
b. Introduce each soil sample to the spirits or entities, asking for their insight into any abnormalities.
c. Patiently await their input while maintaining a respectful and reverent demeanor.

5. Additional Analytical Processes:

a. Conduct tests using esoteric methods, such as scrying, runes, or pendulum dowsing, to detect any otherworldly residue.
b. Compare findings with the spectral detection equipment results.

6. Reporting Results:

a. Compile all findings into a comprehensive report.
b. Present soil type data, spiritual abnormalities, spectral detection results, and any other relevant findings.
c. Detail the locations of each sample and their connection to the decomposed corpses.
d. Provide interpretations and potential implications of the gathered data for those involved in related investigative processes.

By following these meticulous steps, we shall shed light on supernatural influences affecting the decomposed corpses and gain a deeper understanding of the circumstances surrounding their demise.
