Corpse-related necromancy, or the practice of communicating with and manipulating the dead, can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Although the specifics of these practices and beliefs shifted throughout the centuries, their influence on ritualistic practices, societal perceptions, and the development of esoteric magical orders cannot be understated.

The roots of necromancy can be found in ancient Sumeria, Babylon, and Egypt, where priests and magicians purportedly communed with the dead to gain knowledge and power. These ancient beliefs were accompanied by intricate rituals that often involved the presence or remnants of a deceased individual. Some of the oldest known such texts include the Sumerian "Descent of Ishtar" and the Egyptian "Book of the Dead." As civilizations evolved and merged, these ideas and practices spread and adapted to subsequent societies, such as the Greeks and Romans, where necromancy was associated with rites for the gods of the underworld, like Hades and Persephone.

Throughout the Middle Ages, grimoires and manuscripts exploring necromancy and dark magic began to emerge. Texts like the "Picatrix" and the infamous "Necronomicon" describe the summoning of spirits, raising of the dead, and the communication with the other side to obtain information, power, or influence. These widespread texts played an instrumental role in disseminating corpse-related necromancy and reshaping the rituals associated with it. Moreover, they contributed to a growing societal perception of magic as forbidden, dark, and malevolent.

The interconnection between the spread of corpse-centric necromancy and the development of esoteric magical orders is displayed in the formation of secret societies, such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons. These orders often adopted necromantic influences, integrating elements of the death and afterlife into their initiatory rites and belief systems.

Notable necromancers throughout history include individuals like Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, an influential German occultist, and John Dee, an English mathematician, and advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, both of whom studied and practiced necromancy to varying degrees.

Significant shifts in cultural attitudes towards necromancy occurred during the Inquisition, the witch trials in Europe, and the Salem Witch Trials in colonial America. These events symbolize heightened fear and persecution of witchcraft and necromancy practices, driven by religious and social tensions.

Geographical hotspots for necromancy and its associated practices can be found in locations such as Prague, a city renowned for its dark legends and underground alchemical laboratories; New Orleans, a modern hub for Voodoo and spiritual practices that involve communication with the dead; and the catacombs of Rome, where early Christian practices converged with remnants of pagan rites.

Overall, the evolution of corpse-related necromancy throughout history has been shaped by a confluence of religious syncretism, secret societies, infamous practitioners, and diverse cultural interpretations. The widespread dissemination of dark magical texts, coupled with the proliferation of ritualistic practices and the creation of esoteric orders, has played a significant role in establishing necromancy's enduring presence in our cultural imagination.
