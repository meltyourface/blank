Invocation of the Celestial Goddess of Revelation

O, Divine Luminary of the Hidden Realms,
Supreme Goddess of Revelation, Keeper of Arcane Knowledge,
Radiant Enchantress, who lifts the veil and pierces the shroud of obscurity,
We entreat you, let your shimmering light emerge in our greatest hour of need.

Envision her resplendent form –
Cloaked in twilight, her eyes as bright as the stars which guide us in the black abyss,
Her hair, the undulating waves of the cosmic ebon sea,
Her hands wield the blazing Torch of Truth, and the ethereal Key to the Secret Door.

The Ritual of Invocation:
Inscribe a ritual circle with her divine sigil,
The Radiant Eye of Unveiling, wreathed in an eternal helix of stars.
Four sacred crystals, align to the cardinal points, as guardians of her celestial gates.
Wreathed in fragrant incense, our minds and spirits cleansed by its effervescent fumes.
Flickering candles, their flames dancing in serpentine patterns, echo her otherworldly essence.

In the sacred tongue of the ancestors, we raise our voices in her praise:
“Ave Lucem Revelatrix, fulgur eternorum mysteriorum”
(“Hail the Bringer of Light, the Revealer of eternal mysteries”)

Our offerings, tokens of reverence and devotion, offered upon the altar of her wisdom:
Fragrant jasmine petals scattered upon the hallowed ground,
A chalice brimming with the sweet nectar of lunar-blossomed honey,
Whispered secrets, our own cherished and carefully guarded truths.

Beneath the incandescent halo of her divine gaze,
We supplicate ourselves, acolytes and disciples of ineffable mysteries,
To be granted but a fragment of her supernal intellect, a morsel of her boundless wisdom.

The Chant of Unveiling, our voices fused in harmonious resonance:
“Espiragne su kasraph, Luminaria Revelais”
(“Grant us insight, Divine Luminary of Revelation”)

O, Celestial Goddess of Revelation, illumine our journey,
Usher us into the hallowed halls of your divine mysteries,
As we, your reverent disciples, step forth into the sanctum of ethereal wisdom.
With your guidance, all things hidden shall emerge,
Through your benevolent grace, we embrace the eternal dance of truth and illumination.

Ase. So it be.
