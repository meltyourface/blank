To answer this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the key elements present within Gnostic teachings, the Book of Revelation, and the Tarot's Major Arcana, before delving into the specific archetypal figures and symbols that can be found within each and their representation of spiritual awakening, transformation, and transcendental wisdom.

Gnostic teachings primarily focus on the pursuit of divine knowledge or Gnosis, with an emphasis on wisdom acquired through direct experience with the divine. Central ideas include the desire to transcend materialism, as well as the revelation of one's true self through self-knowledge.

The Book of Revelation, on the other hand, is the last book of the New Testament in the Christian Bible, attributed to John the Apostle, and is a prophetic text portraying both the end of the world and the ultimate victory of good over evil, offering hope to believers in times of adversity.

Lastly, the Tarot's Major Arcana is a set of 22 cards representing significant archetypal figures and symbols associated with life's cycles, spiritual lessons, and deep psychological archetypes.

Now, let's examine some examples of archetypal figures and symbols prominent in these teachings and their connections to spiritual awakening, transformation, and transcendental wisdom.

1. The Demiurge & The Devil (Tarot's Major Arcana Card 15)
In Gnostic teachings, the Demiurge is the creator of the material world and is associated with ignorance and illusion. In the Book of Revelation, a similar figure can be seen in the Beast and Satan, who represent deception, falsehood, and evil. The Devil card in Tarot's Major Arcana embodies the same essence, signifying temptation, materialism, and bondage. In all these forms, the message lies in the realization and overcoming of these deceptive forces to aid spiritual awakening and personal transformation.

2. Sophia & The High Priestess (Tarot's Major Arcana Card 2)
Sophia is an essential figure in Gnostic teachings, embodying wisdom, the feminine aspect of the divine, and an essential counterpart to the Demiurge. In the Book of Revelation, a similar figure can be found in the Woman clothed with the sun (Revelation 12), representing the divine feminine and symbolizing protection, creation, and revelation. In the Tarot's Major Arcana, the High Priestess card embodies these aspects as well, signifying intuition, hidden knowledge, and divine feminine power. The connections between these figures emphasize the importance of seeking inner knowledge and embracing the divine feminine to achieve spiritual growth and understanding.

3. The Pleroma & The World (Tarot's Major Arcana Card 21)
The Pleroma is the totality of divine powers and the realm of spiritual fullness in Gnostic thought. It represents the ultimate goal of a spiritual journey - the complete and harmonious integration of the self with the divine. In the Book of Revelation, the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21) serves as a symbol for this divine unity, representing the perfect realization of heaven on earth and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. Both of these concepts are embodied by The World card in the Tarot's Major Arcana, which signifies completion, wholeness, and spiritual enlightenment. The connections between these ideas remind us of the ultimate aim of the spiritual journey - the union with the divine, self-discovery, and transcendental wisdom.

In conclusion, the key themes and ideas found within this analysis include:

- The pursuit of divine knowledge or Gnosis
- The interplay of feminine and masculine aspects of the divine
- Overcoming deception, falsehood, and materialism
- The importance of self-knowledge, intuition, and spiritual growth
- The ultimate goal of spiritual awakening and union with the divine

By examining and drawing connections between the archetypal figures and symbols in Gnostic teachings, the Book of Revelation, and the Tarot's Major Arcana, we gain a deeper understanding of our own spiritual journeys and the nature of spiritual awakening, transformation, and transcendental wisdom.
