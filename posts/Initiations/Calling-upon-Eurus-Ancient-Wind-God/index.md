description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Initiations, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a rhyming incantation for a ceremonial initiation, invoking a specific elemental spirit of your choice (such as air, earth, fire, or water). Utilize archaic language and mystical symbolism, incorporating the chosen elemental spirit's corresponding cardinal direction, ancient deity, and corresponding ritual tools or offerings. Ensure the incantation's complexity increases with each stanza, ultimately reaching a climactic crescendo of power and energy before sealing the summoning.

By air's breath and whispers of Eurus, I call,
From the East, where breaking dawn doth fall,
Zephyr carries on its breath the sacred word,
Onto your realm, the weary spirits spurred.

Anemoi, ancient gods of wind, descend,
With elemental forces poised to blend,
Sweet scents of thyme and lavender laid,
On altar where no mortal hand has weighed.

Through swirling gusts and tempests start,
Turan, Etruscan goddess, pure of heart,
Witness the wielder of air's domain,
With athame, the unseen realm contain.

Now, on the wings of the Eastern gales,
Each word, like a score of haunting tales,
The ritual tools, athame, wand,
Bind spirit to this sovereign command.

At once, the tempest shifts into a sigh,
Mighty wings whisper secrets from on high,
Eurus, tarry not, arise and merge,
Take flight, our mighty purpose to urge.

By the wrath of storm's embrace,
By feathers riding on wind's trace,
Binding chant, the final stanza toll,
Elemental spirit now to console.

Therias Aiolos, may thy winds gather and rise,
For we beseech thee, heed the summoner's cries,
Upon the altar's glowing flameless fire,
Bound and cast, thy essence now conspire.

From the Eastern horizon, now you are near,
Inhale the sacred incense burning clear,
By the sovereign might of ancient lore,
Eurus, I summon thee to manifest... forevermore!
