In order to address this complex and intricate knowledge challenge, we will first break down its components and requirements: 

1. Identify a specific inner alchemical transformation in a profound love affair.
2. Relate this transformation to tarot archetypes and celestial correspondences.
3. Elucidate the multilayered nature of the transformation.
4. Explain the significance of the transformation for spiritual growth and evolution.

Now, let us begin by identifying a specific inner alchemical transformation that may occur during a profound love affair.

Inner Alchemical Transformation: The Union of Opposites

The Union of Opposites, also known as the "coniunctio" or "sacred marriage," is a transformative process wherein two seemingly opposite elements or aspects of the psyche are integrated, leading to wholeness, healing, and psychological growth. This transformative process often occurs during a deep love affair, as the relationship becomes a mirror for self-exploration and understanding, ultimately leading to self-acceptance and integration of one's own shadow aspects.

Tarot Archetypes and Celestial Correspondences

Within the realm of tarot, the Union of Opposites can be symbolized by the Lovers card, which represents the harmonization of dualistic energies, such as the masculine and feminine, conscious and unconscious, and light and dark within the individual. Associated with the zodiac sign of Gemini, ruled by Mercury, the Lovers card expresses the themes of communication, choice, duality, and synthesis.

Celestially, the harmonious aspect between the Sun and Moon, as seen during the New Moon phase, is another symbolic representation of the Union of Opposites. The Sun signifies our conscious, ego-driven self, whereas the Moon embodies our emotions and subconscious mind. The New Moon becomes a symbol of emotional and solar alignment, integrating our energies and promoting inner growth.

Multilayered Nature of the Transformation

The Union of Opposites is a multilayered transformation, not only on a personal level but also in a broader, spiritual context. When engaging in personal relationships, we face our own duality by recognizing the traits and tendencies we share with our partners. As we confront and accept the contrasting aspects within ourselves, we forge a union that transcends duality, leading to growth and healing.

Furthermore, this transformation extends beyond the individual and impacts others, as the healing brought by the Union of Opposites allows one to facilitate healing for others by fostering empathy, understanding, and compassion.

Significance for Spiritual Growth and Evolution

The Union of Opposites is a vital component of spiritual growth, as it paves the way for a deeper connection with one's higher self, or spiritual nature. By acknowledging and accepting our darker aspects and transcending duality, we move closer to a state of spiritual wholeness. This wholeness can lead to a more authentic engagement with the world and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life.

In conclusion, the Union of Opposites is a powerful inner alchemical transformation that occurs through the course of a profound love affair. Symbolized by the Lovers tarot card and the New Moon's celestial correspondence, it represents a harmonious integration of opposing forces. By understanding this multilayered transformation and embracing the spiritual growth it offers, individuals can embark on a journey towards greater self-awareness, wholeness, and purpose.
