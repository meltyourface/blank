As a master of the esoteric, I will perform an in-depth analysis and prediction of upcoming global or personal events by employing a combination of advanced divination techniques. Below is the documentation of the process and findings from the different methods used, as well as a comprehensive interpretation of the outcome. Keep in mind that divination results are subject to interpretation and cosmic influences.

**Geomancy**:
Geomancy involves divining the future through the interpretation of figures formed by randomly generated dots. Twelve geomantic figures are produced, which are then combined to create a geomantic chart. Through this method, the following figures manifested:

1. **Acquisitio**
2. **Tristitia**
3. **Albus**

With these figures, the chart indicates potential growth and expansion, followed by a period of sorrow or hardship, and ultimately resulting in a sense of spiritual clarity and purification.

I Ching:
Throwing yarrow stalks or tossing coins, I interpret the hexagrams formed from a series of six broken or unbroken lines. **The hexagrams obtained in this process are**:

1. Hexagram 27 - The Corners of the Mouth (Nourishment)
2. Hexagram 47 - Exhaustion (Oppression)
3. Hexagram 58 - The Joyous (Lake)

This combination of hexagrams suggests a phase where proper nurturing of the body, mind, and spirit is critical, with a potential risk of exhaustion or draining circumstances. Ultimately, joy and a sense of peace will prevail.

Thoth Tarot:
Drawing three cards from the Thoth Tarot deck, I interpret the associations and meanings behind each card. **The cards drawn are**:

1. **The Empress**
2. The Ten of Swords (Ruin)
3. The Two of Cups (Love)

The series of cards points to a scenario where creativity and growth are initiated, but likely to be followed by a temporary collapse or failure. At last, healing and emotional fulfilment can be expected, signifying restoration and balance.

Astrological Data, Numerology, and Sigil Magick:
These additional systems corroborate and enrich the findings above. Numerology identifies the significance of number 7, suggesting a highly spiritual period with great wisdom to be gained through transition; however, it's essential to overcome illusions and embrace change.

Sigil magick involves the creation of a symbolic representation of the desired outcome, and in this instance, prominent symbols include a rising phoenix, juxtaposing themes of destruction and renewal.

From the interconnected divinatory practices, a pattern emerges â€“ one of growth and creation, followed by trials and potential collapse, culminating in healing and renewal. The key influences that arise encompass a need for adaptability, resilience, and embracing change. While the specifics of the events may vary, the pattern formed through the various methods holds lessons and insights significant to the upcoming global or personal events.
