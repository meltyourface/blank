Comprehensive Strategy for Harnessing Troll Formulae in Holistic Wellness

1. **Identifying and invoking specific malevolent and benevolent Troll spirits**:

a) Jorvulg the Painbringer - Specializes in easing physical pain. His sigil represents intertwined thorns that signify unbinding pain.

b) Helsdóttir the Mender - Heals emotional pain and trauma. Her sigil incorporates a chorus of melodious voices, symbolizing balance and harmony between emotions.

c) Grunntroll the Fortifier - Boosts the immune system and enhances resilience against diseases. His sigil is a mighty, unbreakable shield.

d) Fafnaglind the Nurturer - Promotes mental wellbeing and a balanced perspective. Her sigil is a flourishing, well-rooted tree, symbolizing mental growth.

2. **Delineating the intricate rituals and incantations**:

a) Begin rituals during new or full moons to maximize energy potency.

b) Create a properly cleansed, sacred space using sage, sea salt, or incense.

c) Inscribe the chosen Troll spirit's sigil onto a parchment or cloth using essential oils that correlate to the spirit's attributes (e.g., rosemary oil for Jorvulg, the Painbringer).

d) Recite incantations that invoke each spirit while maintaining visualization of their associated symbols. Repeat the incantation three times to seal the invocation.

3. **Blending esoteric Troll practices with alternative healing modalities**:

a) Enhance healing by incorporating crystal therapy into the ritual. Utilize intuitive, protective stones like black tourmaline, smoky quartz, or amethyst.

b) Through reiki, channel energy to and from the user, while invoking the Troll spirit's energies in a harmonious and balanced manner.

c) Conduct shamanic journeying during the ritual, enabling deeper exploration and understanding of the individual's ailment and empowering the healing process.

4. **Crafting bespoke energy-infused talismans**:

a) Use wood, copper, or clay to fashion talismans featuring the sigil of the summoned Troll spirit.

b) Incorporate the living energies of plants like fern, moss, or lichen as a potent source for the spirit's nourishment.

c) Charge the talisman during the ritual, and instruct the user to wear or carry it to extend the healing and protective benefits.

5. **Establishing methods for ascertaining efficacy**:

a) Implement quantitative metrics such as the comparison of pre-and-post treatment blood pressure or heart rate, and physiological indicators of stress and inflammation.

b) Utilize qualitative observations to gauge shifts in mood, energy levels, and subjective experiences of pain or emotions.

Example Case Study:

Laura, a 30-year-old woman, has been suffering from migraines and emotional stress. Under the proposed strategy, Laura would benefit from invoking both Jorvulg the Painbringer and Helsdóttir the Mender.

The ritual would commence during the new moon to harness lunar energies. Alongside the invocation, Laura would receive crystal therapy employing amethyst to soothe her pain and moonstone to help balance emotions.

In tandem, a reiki healer would channel energies to facilitate the healing process. Laura would then embark on a shamanic journey, further empowering her healing.

Finally, a moss-infused wooden talisman featuring both Jorvulg and Helsdóttir's sigils would be crafted and charged for Laura to carry. The treatment's efficacy would be measured both quantitatively and qualitatively, tracking Laura's progress through physiological indicators and her subjective experience.
