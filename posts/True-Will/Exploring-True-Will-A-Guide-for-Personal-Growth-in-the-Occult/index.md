## The Concept of True Will in the Occult

Origins of True Will

The concept of True Will emerged from the study and practice of the occult, particularly in regards to developing one's inner self and aligning oneself with the universe. This idea was most notably advocated by English occultist Aleister Crowley, who described it as the innermost essence of a person, their divine purpose, and the ultimate expression of their individuality.

True Will and Personal Growth

True Will plays a significant role in personal growth and self-discovery within the context of the occult. It is a journey to uncover and express one's genuine nature and desires, aligning them with their spiritual purpose. As we go deeper into our spiritual journey, understanding our True Will can bring us closer to achieving self-actualization and realizing our true potential. By recognizing our True Will, we clear away the illusions, distractions, and societal conditioning that may hinder our progress and success in life.

True Will can also be considered a form of self-mastery, wherein we gain control over our thoughts, emotions, and actions. By pursuing our True Will, we can achieve a sense of harmony and balance both within ourselves and with the world around us. This heightened state of awareness leads to greater personal power, confidence, and adaptability, which are essential qualities to navigate the complex landscape of the occult.

Step-By-Step Exploration of One's True Will

For initiates seeking to explore their True Will as part of their spiritual journey, the following steps are crucial in bringing this concept to life:

1. Introspection and Self-Reflection: Begin by examining your deepest desires, passions, and inclinations. Contemplate your past choices and the outcomes they've led to, what brings you joy, and what feels burdensome or inauthentic.

2. Meditation and Visualization: Regularly practice meditation and visualization techniques to quiet the mind and gain clarity on your innermost thoughts and feelings. Through visualization, imagine the person you aspire to become and the life you desire in alignment with your True Will.

3. Divination: Utilize divination methods such as tarot, runes, or astrology to gain insight into your spiritual purpose and receive guidance from your higher self or external forces.

4. Journaling: Document your self-discoveries, insights, and potential revelations related to your True Will. Journaling can help solidify your findings and keep you focused on your spiritual journey.

5. Ritual Work: Perform rituals and/or engage in regular magical practice to establish a deeper connection with your True Will and the energies that drive it. This may include spell work, invoking deities, or following specific occult traditions.

6. Seeking Guidance: Consider consulting with a teacher, mentor, or practitioner well-versed in the occult and the concept of True Will. Their wisdom and experience can provide invaluable guidance and direction.

7. Continuous Evaluation: Regularly reassess your progress and growth in understanding your True Will. Realize that this journey is an ongoing process, and you may encounter obstacles or make course corrections as your understanding deepens.

As you delve deeper into the mysteries of the occult and the concept of True Will, remember that this journey is a personal and transformative one. Stay true to yourself and embrace the pursuit of truth and understanding, as it will guide you to new heights of personal growth and mastery within the realm of the occult.
