To establish a connection between the symbology of the scythe, the esoteric concept of cycles, and the necessary mental state and environment during a successful invocation of the Lord of the Scythe, we first need to discuss each component separately and then draw the connections between them. This will involve understanding the symbology, the concept of cycles, the required mental state, and the ideal environment to invoke the Lord of the Scythe. Finally, we will also discuss why alternative interpretations may not yield the desired results.

1. **Symbology of the Scythe**:
The scythe, depicted as a long-handled agricultural tool with a curved blade, symbolizes several important ideas. Historically used for reaping and harvesting grain, it often signifies the concept of death and rebirth, as well as the cycles of nature. The Grim Reaper, a common personification of death in Western culture, is portrayed wielding a scythe. In the context of esotericism, the scythe also represents the process of transformation, change, and regeneration.

2. **Esoteric Concept of Cycles**:
Cycles are a crucial concept in the esoteric and occult world, representing the natural flow of energy and life. This can be seen in the cycles of nature, such as the changing seasons, the cycles of birth and death, or the cyclical manner in which energy transitions from one state to another. Cycles in an esoteric context often involve spiritual, emotional, or energetic processes that are necessary for growth, change, and spiritual evolution. The concept of cycles emphasizes the importance of balance and the inevitability of transformation.

3. **Mental State for Invocation**:
To successfully invoke the Lord of the Scythe, the practitioner must enter a specific mental state characterized by focus, intentionality, humility, and respect for the power being called upon. The practitioner must clear their mind of distractions and extraneous thoughts, creating a mental environment conducive to connecting with the Lord of the Scythe. This may involve meditation, visualization, or ritualistic practices that help hone the practitioner's mental focus and establish their intent.

4. **Ideal Environment for Invocation**:
Creating an appropriate physical environment for the invocation is equally important. This may involve ensuring a quiet and uninterrupted space, setting up symbolic items or landmarks related to the Lord of the Scythe, such as images or representations of the scythe and other symbolic items signifying cycles or transformation. The environment should also be clean and well-organized, invoking a sense of order and balance to promote the connection with the Lord of the Scythe.

Now, we must connect these concepts to establish a comprehensive understanding of how one would successfully invoke the Lord of the Scythe.

The symbology of the scythe and the concept of cycles are closely related; they both signify the ideas of death, rebirth, and transformation. Recognizing these connections allows the practitioner to focus their intentions more deeply on the power and energy associated with the Lord of the Scythe. This, in turn, strengthens the invocation and corresponding mental state. 

Moreover, by creating an environment that resonates with the symbology of the scythe and the concept of cycles, the practitioner can facilitate the proper mental state more easily, enhancing the connection to the Lord of the Scythe. By aligning their mental state and physical environment with these ideas, the practitioner heightens their ability to establish a powerful and fruitful bond with the Lord of the Scythe.

Alternative interpretations which do not take into account the importance of the symbology of the scythe, the concept of cycles, or misjudge the necessary mental state or environment for invocation may result in a weakened or unsuccessful invocation, or may even lead to unintended consequences as a result of invoking a different entity or power.

In summary, to establish a connection between the symbology of the scythe, the esoteric concept of cycles, and the required mental state and environment for a successful invocation of the Lord of the Scythe, a practitioner must understand the deep connections between these elements, focus their intentions with humility and respect, and create a conducive environment for the invocation. By understanding and implementing these components, the practitioner can maximize the potential for a successful invocation and establish a powerful connection with the Lord of the Scythe.
