Blueprint for the Development and Implementation of an Enchanted Solomonic Sigil

1. Connection with the Solomonic Tradition
To establish a connection with the Solomonic tradition, we will incorporate authentic primary sources such as the Lesser Key of Solomon (also known as the Lemegeton) and the Clavis Inferni. These grimoires contain valuable information on the crafting of sigils and the performance of rituals. By faithfully adhering to these texts' instructions, we can ensure that our practices are consistent with the ancient esoteric tradition.

2. Type of Entity and Esoteric Hierarchy
Given the multitude of entities that could be bound, we will focus on a malevolent spirit from the Goetia (a section of the Lesser Key of Solomon), specifically a Marquis-type spirit. These spirits are known for their deceptive and manipulative nature but can provide valuable knowledge when bound. The chosen spirit will be subordinate to one of the 72 demons of the Ars Goetia, and the hierarchy will be duly noted.

3. Magical Materials
Corresponding magical materials are essential to reinforce the power of the Solomonic sigil. For the chosen Marquis-type spirit, we will require:

- Herbs: Wormwood, mugwort, and vervain, all known for their protective and summoning properties.
- Gems: Onyx and obsidian. These stones are associated with grounding energies and can help in containing the spirit.
- Metals: Iron and copper. Both metals serve to strengthen the sigil.

4. Timing of Ritual
The timing for the containment ritual is crucial in enhancing the effectiveness of our Solomonic sigil. The following factors must be considered:

- Lunar phase: The spirit is likely to be most susceptible to entrapment during the waning moon, symbolizing the decrease of its influence.
- Planetary alignment: Align the ritual with Mars and Saturn, as the Marquis-type spirits often relate to war and obstacles.
- Days of the week: Perform the ritual on a Tuesday, the day ruled by Mars.

5. Sacred Space Layout
The layout for the sacred space should be prepared carefully:

- Area preparation: Cleanse the area with a mixture of salt, water, and the chosen herbs. Draw a large circle on the ground to serve as the boundary.
- Consecrate tools: Bless the ritual tools (such as knives and chalices) with appropriate consecration prayers.
- Talisman positions: Place talismans and seals on designated spots within the circle, following the grimoire's guidance.

6. Solomonic Sigil Drawing and Empowerment
To draw and empower the sigil:

- Incorporate sacred symbols: Include symbols related to Mars and Saturn; the Seal of Solomon is also vital.
- Mystical inscriptions: Add the spirit's name in an appropriate magical script, such as Theban or Malachim.
- Hidden associations: Weave astrological and numerological elements into the sigil as desired to heighten its power.

7. Incantations and Invocations
To activate the sigil and bind the entity:

- Recite prayers of protection: Pray to higher powers, such as Archangel Michael, to protect you during the ritual.
- Invoke the entity: Use traditional invocations, addressing the spirit by its name and rank.
- Conjure the binding: Recite a series of binding incantations, clearly articulating each word and emphasizing the tone.

8. Ethical and Spiritual Consequences
Entrapment and binding of otherworldly entities entails significant ethical and spiritual responsibilities:

- Control: Maintain strict control over the entity by periodically reciting the binding incantation and reinforcing the sigil.
- Service: Only bind the entity if its knowledge or abilities serve a higher purpose, without malicious intent.
- Release: Include a release clause in the binding process, allowing the spirit to be set free after accomplishing its tasks.

By following this blueprint, an enchanted Solomonic sigil can be created to entrap and bind malevolent spirits, thereby harnessing their knowledge and power for higher purposes. It is crucial to respect the intricacies of the tradition and acknowledge the responsibilities that come with such practices.
