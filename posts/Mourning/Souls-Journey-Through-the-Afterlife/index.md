In twilit realm where Mourning weaves,
A direful elegy enfolds each breeze,
There souls embark, bereft of breath,
On spectral odyssey beyond the veils of Death.

In unseen shrouds of spectral hue,
These mournful shades commence their journey through,
Across the plains of Stygian night,
Beyond the reach of mortal sight.

First, the River of Forlorn Deeps,
Where languished cries and secret whispers creep,
A passage oft by Charon led,
Who ferries souls to places oft untread.

To Asphodel, the dormant fields,
Where lost dreams rest, conceal'd beneath concealing veils,
Here wander souls untethered, free,
Yet linger still in muted reverie.

The soul, a flicker midst the gloom,
To deeper realms it ventures, enshrouded by doom,
Through thorny brambles of despair,
To Halls of Dissonance, a cursed lair.

Here dwell the Wraiths of Silence Thunderous,
Whose inky chains bind secrets ominous,
A whispered curse, heart's chamber fell,
The soul, benighted, craves to quell.

This quagmire vast, lament's embrace,
Yet shrouded deep within, lies Mortal Grace,
From caterpillar's dark cocoon,
Emerges offspring of the Moon.

A breath of calm amid the storm,
Enters the soul, transforming, reborn,
With silver wings, it takes its flight,
To enchanted planes, where mysteries alight.

The Astral Forest, ne'er before beheld,
Where Aethereal Royal Courts in ardor meld,
Attraction to the soul's own flame,
Their sigil draws, in patterns untamed.

Through tides of slumbering reveries,
As serpents dance 'round tree of memories,
The Tree of Essence comes awake,
And forth, deific presence breaks.

Arcane Entities, embodiment of Lore,
With voiceless tongues unlock the hidden door,
The soul, now scholar, sits and waits,
As cosmic wisdom through their scripture percolates.

The secrets held, now set ablaze,
A phoenix birthed from ashes of malaise,
Ascends the bridges to Celestial Halls,
To ever merge with One, whose call enthralls.

Oh, soul, so swift in mournful flight,
Embrace thy destiny 'midst unseen light,
Transcendent truths we may not see,
Yet woven deep, Thy poetry.
