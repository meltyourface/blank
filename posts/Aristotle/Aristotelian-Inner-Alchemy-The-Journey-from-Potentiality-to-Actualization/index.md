To respond to the knowledge challenge, we shall first lay down brief definitions of Aristotle's philosophy on potentiality and actuality, inner alchemy and its relation to the esoteric tradition. Subsequently, we will attempt to draw connections between these concepts, exploring how inner alchemy can be interpreted as an actualization process from an Aristotelian lens. 

Aristotle's Concepts of Potentiality and Actuality:
According to Aristotle, a metaphysical distinction exists between 'potentiality' (dunamis) and 'actuality' (entelecheia or energeia) within beings. Potentiality refers to the inherent capacity or possibility of a being to achieve a certain state or to perform a specific action. Actuality, on the other hand, denotes the realization of that capacity or the fulfillment of that possibility. For Aristotle, every being's primary goal is to actualize its inherent potential and to realize its purpose, or telos. This process is driven by the concept of the First Unmoved Mover, which exists in a state of complete actuality and inspires the movement within the cosmos as beings strive towards their actualization.

Inner Alchemy and Esoteric Tradition:
Inner alchemy is a concept that originates from the esoteric and occult traditions, particularly in disciplines such as Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and alchemy. It is a spiritual practice that involves a transformative process aimed at achieving wholeness, self-realization, and spiritual advancement. Inner alchemy is centered around the idea of refining one's energies, transmuting negative aspects of the self into positive, and awakening latent inner potential.

Now that we have established basic definitions, let's delve into establishing the connections between potentiality and actuality in Aristotle's philosophy and the esoteric concept of inner alchemy.

Aristotelian Actualization and Inner Alchemy:
The process of inner alchemy closely mirrors the Aristotelian concept of moving from potentiality to actuality. As an initiate embarks on the path of inner alchemy, they begin at a state of potentiality, or inherent capacity––their latent spiritual potential. 

As they engage in the transformative work of inner alchemy, such as meditation, visualization, and other esoteric practices, they gradually actualize their spiritual potential, experiencing states of higher consciousness, developing psychic abilities, and evolving in their understanding of themselves and the universe. It is also important to mention that the concept of telos plays a significant role in esoteric tradition as well, as the ultimate goal is to attain spiritual enlightenment, akin to achieving one's purpose.

Moreover, Aristotle's concept of causality, particularly the Final Cause (or the purpose/end for which something exists), can be seen as a driving force for the initiation of one's journey into inner alchemy. For example, the potential psychic or healer begins to unveil and develop their psychic abilities as they serve a higher cause. In this case, a connection can be established between the actualization of their potential and the pursuit of their telos.

It should be noted that while we can draw parallels between the Aristotelian view on potentiality and actuality, and the inner alchemical journey, there are fundamental differences in the philosophies. Aristotle's concepts are rooted in rationality, logic, and empirical observation, whereas inner alchemy is an experiential, spiritual discipline that transcends those frameworks.

In conclusion, the connection between Aristotle's philosophy of potentiality and actuality and the esoteric concept of inner alchemy demonstrates that both disciplines, although originating from different traditions, share a common theme: the transformation and evolution of a being towards the fulfillment of its inherent potential. In the case of inner alchemy, the spiritual initiate undergoes a process of self-discovery and spiritual growth, which echoes the Aristotelian ideas of realizing potential and fulfilling one's telos. This connection between philosophies illustrates the universal nature of human striving for progress and purpose across diverse frameworks of thought.
