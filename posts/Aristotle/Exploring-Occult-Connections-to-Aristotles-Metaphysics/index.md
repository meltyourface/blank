To thoroughly analyze Aristotle's metaphysical dichotomy between act and potency, essence and existence in relation to the mystery of the Prime Mover, and understand its connection to the fundamental tenets of occult symbolism and teachings, let us begin by disentangling these concepts individually.

1. ****Act and potency****: Defined by Aristotle in his work, "Metaphysics," act (actus) refers to the actualization of a certain state, quality, or existence, while potency (potentia) signifies the capacity, potential, or the possibility for that state, quality, or existence to be realized. In other words, act refers to the existence of a thing in its full completeness, while potency represents the potential for a thing to change or evolve.

2. ****Essence and existence****: Essence refers to the innate set of characteristics that define a particular entity and makes it what it is. It is the underlying nature of a thing that can be understood in isolation from its existence. Existence, on the other hand, is the state of being, the actuality of a thing's presence in the world. When essence and existence combine, they create the complete reality of a thing.

3. ****The Prime Mover****: One of the central principles of Aristotle's metaphysics, the Prime Mover, or the "unmoved mover," is the source of all motion and change in the universe. This principle states that there must be an eternal, unchanging cause responsible for the constant motion and change we observe in the natural world. The Prime Mover is not affected by the activity it generates and is purely actual, devoid of any potentiality.

Now that we have unpacked these fundamental concepts, let's connect them with occult symbolism and teachings.

Occultism, as a practice and belief system, focuses on exploring and understanding hidden knowledge, symbolism, and the various aspects of reality that are not readily apparent to the human mind. The ultimate goal of occult practices is to gain enlightenment, transform the self, and understand the true nature of the universe.

The dichotomies of act and potency, and essence and existence, bear close parallels with various aspects of the occult worldview. For example, act and potency can be connected to the concept of microcosm and macrocosm, which suggests that the individual (microcosm) contains within themselves the potential for the entire universe (macrocosm). In the context of spiritual alchemy and personal transformation, the individual begins with a state of potency and, through various practices and rituals, seeks to attain a state of self-actualization â€“ the full realization of one's inner potential and connection with the universe.

Similarly, the dichotomy between essence and existence resonates with the occult understanding of the relationship between the material and the spiritual planes. The material world is perceived as a reflection or manifestation of the spiritual plane, and the essence of a thing is seen as its spiritual reality, while its existence represents its outward form in the material world. Through occult practices, one aims to connect with the essential nature of all things, revealing a deeper understanding of the true reality beyond its material form.

The concept of the Prime Mover also holds great significance in occult thought. As the ultimate source of all motion and change, the Prime Mover is often identified with the concept of the Divine or the Absolute in various occult traditions. This identification reflects the aspiration to grasp and understand the nature of the ultimate cause, developing a relationship with the divine which aids in personal transformation.

In conclusion, Aristotle's metaphysical dichotomy between act and potency, essence and existence, and the concept of the Prime Mover, deeply connect to the fundamental tenets of occult symbolism and teachings. The principles of act and potency can be related to the microcosm and macrocosm, essence and existence to the material and spiritual planes, and the Prime Mover is often seen as a reflection of the Divine or Absolute in occult thought. All of these ideas form the basis for understanding the nature of reality and the self, which are central aims of occult practices.
