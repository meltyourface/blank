  Construct a consecrated sigil imbued with the ancient wisdom of a High Priestess of Antiquity, invoking the divine essence of a specified celestial entity or revered deity. Utilize a blend of cryptic symbology, timeless alchemical inscriptions, and potent metaphysical correspondences to intensify the power of the sigil and magnify its purpose.

To construct a consecrated sigil imbued with the ancient wisdom of a High Priestess of Antiquity, we will focus on invoking the divine essence of the celestial entity known as "The Watcher at the Threshold," a revered guardian of astral and spiritual realms. This sigil will serve as a conduit to invoke divine wisdom and protection from the entity. 

First, we shall gather materials that enhance the connection to the divine and channel the necessary energies, such as parchment, a quill pen, and ink infused with sacred herbs like frankincense, myrrh, and wormwood for their metaphysical properties.

1. Begin by drawing the Vesica Piscis, an ancient symbol of harmony and union, representing the sacred geometry of creation. The Vesica Piscis will serve as a foundation upon which the sigil will be built.

2. Inside the Vesica Piscis, draw the Alchemical symbol for Spirit, a circle with a centered cross and arrow pointing upward, connecting to the divine and celestial realms.

3. Integrate the protective symbol of the Pentacle within the Alchemical symbol for Spirit, allowing the intersection of these powerful symbols to serve as the primary focal point of the sigil.

4. Around the Vesica Piscis, inscribe the Theban alphabet, an ancient, cryptic script used for sacred writings and mystical incantations. This will strengthen the connection between the wearer and the celestial entity, The Watcher at the Threshold.

5. Surrounding the inscription, place eight points in the shape of an octagon symbolizing infinity, mirroring the alignments of celestial bodies in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. These points represent the harmony of cosmic energies and astral connections.

6. Lastly, encircle the entire sigil with the Ancient Egyptian Ouroboros – a serpent devouring its own tail – a representation of eternal renewal, protection, and the cyclical nature of the cosmos.

Consecrate the completed sigil with a ritual incorporating the elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Meditate to empower the sigil and visualize the divine essence of The Watcher at the Threshold radiating through the sigil.

The sigil can be carried, placed in a sacred space, or inscribed on an amulet or talisman for protection, spiritual guidance, and communing with the wisdom and guardianship of The Watcher at the Threshold. The sigil's powerful symbology, alchemical components, and sacred geometry serve as a masterful creation of a High Priestess of Antiquity, drawing upon the divine essence of a celestial entity, and magnifying the sigil's purpose.
