Answer: Her family's religious and mystical beliefs greatly influenced her literary work on the supernatural.

**Explanation**: Annette von Droste-Hülshoff was a German poet and writer who lived in the 19th century. She is best known for her Gothic poems and her novella, "The Jew's Beech." Her family's religious and mystical beliefs had a significant impact on her work, particularly in terms of her interest in the supernatural.

Annette's family was devoutly Catholic, and their home, the Hülshoff Castle, was steeped in religious and mystical traditions. The castle itself was filled with religious artwork and relics, creating an atmosphere that was conducive to fostering a fascination with the spiritual and the supernatural. Additionally, the family would often share stories of local legends and supernatural occurrences, further fueling Annette's imagination.

Annette carried this interest in the supernatural throughout her life, and it can be seen in her writings. Her poems, such as "The Spirit's Salute" and "The Dark Flute," often contain elements of the Gothic and explore themes of spirituality and the supernatural. While she may not have had direct, personal encounters with paranormal phenomena, her upbringing and the influence of her family's beliefs certainly contributed to her work in this area.

In relation to esotericism and occultism, although Annette's work does not specifically focus on the occult sciences or develop into a treatise on the subject, the mystical atmosphere surrounding her childhood and her family's beliefs serve as a backdrop for her literary exploration of the supernatural and the spiritual world.

Thus, it is important to consider the context of her life, upbringing, and the religious environment in which she lived when studying her fascination with the supernatural. Her family's religious and mystical beliefs played a significant role in shaping her literary work and provided her with a strong foundation for her interest in the supernatural.
