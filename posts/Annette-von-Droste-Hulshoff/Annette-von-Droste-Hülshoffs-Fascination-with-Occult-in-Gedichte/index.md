The inclusion of supernatural beings and themes in her poetry collection "Gedichte"

Annette von Droste-Hülshoff's fascination with the occult and esoteric can be seen most prominently in her poetry collection "Gedichte." As one of the earliest German female authors to examine these themes, her works demonstrate a deep connection with the nature, spirituality, and the mysterious realms beyond the known world.

The context of her interest in the esoteric and occult was influenced by her family, upbringing, and the social environment she was part of, which contributed to her unique perspective on these themes. Born into an aristocratic Catholic family, Droste-Hülshoff was exposed to a conservative environment that reinforced her fascination with themes of nature, religion, and the supernatural. German Romanticism also played a significant role in shaping her literary interests, as it was a movement that celebrated the mysterious, emotional, and transcendent aspects of human experience.

In "Gedichte," Droste-Hülshoff delves into themes like supernatural beings, death, and mystical experiences, which manifest in various poems across the collection. For example, in her poem "Der Geierpfiff" (The Vulture's Whistle), she explores the eerie legend of a vulture who feeds on human souls. Other poems, such as "Der Spiegel des Cyprianus" (The Mirror of Cyprianus) and "Der Knabe im Moor" (The Boy in the Moor), similarly engage with supernatural, mysterious, and eerie themes that reveal the author's interest in the unknown and unexplained.

It is essential to note that while Droste-Hülshoff's other works, such as "Die Judenbuche" and "Perdu!", also delve into various aspects of the supernatural, their primary focus lies on social commentary, morality, and human relationships. On the other hand, her interest in paranormal events and involvement with the Society for Psychical Research was more of an extracurricular curiosity, rather than a direct influence on her literary works.

In conclusion, Annette von Droste-Hülshoff's exploration of the occult and esoteric can be best observed in her poetry collection "Gedichte," which serves as a testimony to her prowess as a German author unafraid to explore new and unconventional themes in her work. By examining her poetry closely, readers can appreciate her ability to combine the mystical with the tangible, creating a unique, immersive experience that resonates with her audience to this day.
