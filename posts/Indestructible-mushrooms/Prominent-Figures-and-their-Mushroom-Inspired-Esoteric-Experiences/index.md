Merlin is said to have become intimately acquainted with the power of Indestructible Mushrooms during his time as the advisor to King Arthur. It is believed that the wizard used the mushrooms to enhance his magical abilities, allowing him to perform extraordinary feats that defied conventional explanation. Merlin's mastery of the mystic fungi is seen in the creation of Stonehenge, which he is said to have lifted and placed using only the power of his mind, fueled by the mushrooms.

Hildegard von Bingen was a Christian mystic and visionary, and the first recorded person to study the properties of Indestructible Mushrooms systematically. She is known to have incorporated them into her spiritual practices, using their power to access visionary experiences that she believed were divine revelations. These potent experiences led to her creation of an extensive body of esoteric knowledge centered around the mushrooms, which is still referenced today.

The Enochian system remains influential even today, with various modern occultists and magicians practicing its techniques.
