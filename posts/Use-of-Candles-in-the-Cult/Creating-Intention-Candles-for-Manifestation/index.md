## The Ritual of the Sacred Intention Candle

Materials needed:

1. A candle mold of desired shape
2. Natural beeswax
3. A braid of cotton wick
4. A double boiler
5. A wooden stirring stick
6. Essential oils specific to your intention
7. Sigil specific to your intention
8. Colored candle dye or pigment corresponding to your intention
9. A ritual knife or athame
10. A working space and altar

**Setting the workspace**: 
Prepare your sacred space by cleansing it and setting up the altar with a representation of each of the elements – earth, air, fire, and water. Place your materials in their corresponding elemental directions.
**Step 1**: Invocation
Invoke the deities or spiritual forces that align with your intention – address each force individually and ask for their presence and blessing. Light incense and a white candle to aid your connection with the spiritual realm.
**Step 2**: Candle Mold & Sigil
With the ritual knife, carve the chosen sigil onto the inside of the candle mold. As you carve, focus on the goal you wish to manifest and feel the energy being channeled into the mold.
**Step 3**: Preparing the Wax & Wick
Melt the beeswax in the double boiler, keeping your intention in mind. While the wax is melting, anoint the wick with a sacred oil that correlates with your intention. Place the wick in the center of the mold, letting the sigil touch the desired end.
**Step 4**: Coloring and Infusing the Wax
Add the color dye or pigment specific to your intention into the melted wax. A guideline for candle colors is as follows:

- White: divine protection and purity
- Black: banishing, removing obstacles
- Red: passion, desire, power
- Green: growth, abundance, prosperity
- Blue: healing, tranquility
- Yellow: intellect, creativity, success
- Purple: psychic abilities, spiritual growth
- Orange: motivation, courage, transformation
- Pink: friendship, love, self-care

As the color is blending, anoint a few drops of essential oil into the wax, keeping in mind their esoteric properties. Mix the wax with the wooden stirring stick, and chant your intention over it three times.
**Step 5**: Pouring the Wax & Sealing the Intention
Take a deep breath and visualize the energy surrounding your intention being drawn into your heart. Pour the wax into the candle mold, allowing the energy you've gathered to flow into it. Visualize your objective as a reality while pouring.
**Step 6**: Solidifying & Unveiling
Allow the candle to solidify for several hours. Perform any ritual actions or prayers that align with your intention during this period.

Gently remove the candle from the mold and examine the sigil on the surface. Hold it in your hands and thank the spiritual forces who assisted you, releasing them from the ritual. Extinguish the white invocation candle.
**Step 7**: Burning & Manifesting
Light the sacred intention candle in a safe space and meditate on the outcome of your desire. Allow the candle to burn for a specific number of days or hours that match your intention or until it burns out completely. Trust that the spiritual forces will guide the manifestation of your goal.

Remember to practice fire safety during this process and never leave a burning candle unattended. The Ritual of the Sacred Intention Candle is complete, and your goal is manifesting.
