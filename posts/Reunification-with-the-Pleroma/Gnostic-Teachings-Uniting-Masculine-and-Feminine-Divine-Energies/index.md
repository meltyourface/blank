Deciphering and Translating Passages from Ancient Gnostic Texts:

Focusing on the Nag Hammadi library, I have deciphered and translated a passage from the Gospel of Thomas (saying 22) that includes mention of Reunification with the Pleroma:

"Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his disciples, 'These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom.' They said to him, 'Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?' Jesus said to them, 'When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female one and the same, then you will enter the kingdom.'"

Cosmological Concepts: Aeons, Archons, and the Demiurge:

In Gnostic cosmology, Aeons are divine emanations or aspects of the true God ("the Pleroma"), containing pairs of masculine and feminine energies representing various divine attributes. Archons, on the other hand, are rulers subordinate to the Demiurge, a lesser god responsible for creating the flawed, material world. The Demiurge is often depicted as an ignorant or malevolent force who traps the divine sparks contained within human beings, preventing their reunification with the Pleroma.

The intricate relationship between divine emanations and the path to Gnosis:

To attain Gnosis (knowledge of the divine) and to achieve Reunification with the Pleroma, one must recognize the nature of the Archons and the Demiurge, and overcome the material world's limitations. By realizing one's true nature, which transcends the material realm, a seeker can gain knowledge and wisdom that lead to spiritual growth and transcendence.

Within the passage translated from the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus encourages his disciples to "make the two one," alluding to the essential Gnostic teaching of merging with both the masculine and feminine aspects of the divine. By harmonizing these aspects within oneself, spiritual growth, and ultimately (re)unification with the Pleroma is possible.

The process of spiritual development towards Reunification with the Pleroma entails discovering one's inherent connection to the divine, releasing attachments to the material world, and embracing a path of transformative knowledge. Understanding the intricate interactions between the divine entities and our place within the cosmos leads to the path of Gnosis, our ascent from this limited material world to the state of ultimate transcendence and fusion with the Pleroma.
