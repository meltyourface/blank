## The Rite of Ascension into Necromantia

Setting: The ceremony must be performed at the nexus of ley lines. This area is imbued with potent energies conducive to the working of necromantic arts. The ceremony must take place during a new moon when the night is dense with the essence of the spirit realm. Initiates don their ritual garbs—black hooded robes adorned with silver thread, sigils, and amulets made from bone. Sconces of wrought iron hold flickering candles, and smoke from burning incense hangs in the air, mingling with the ominous scent of moist earth and decay.

1. **Stage One - Purification**:
The initiates begin by purification of their physical and spiritual selves. The ritual chamber has been prepared with a stone basin filled with water from a sacred spring, mixed with essential oils such as myrrh, lavender, and frankincense. Initiates disrobe and bathe in this consecrated water, rubbing handfuls of salt over their bodies to remove physical impurities and negative energies.

Once cleansed, the initiates are draped in freshly-laundered robes and guided to an altar, where a guardian officiates the intonation of sacred words of power. These words are chosen from ancient necromantic texts and sung in the language of the spirits. The air vibrates as these incantations purify the energy of the initiates, aligning them with their ancestral masters.

2. **Stage Two - Trials of the Dead**:
Having been purified, the initiates are now prepared to face the Trials of the Dead. These challenges are designed to test their aptitude for the necromantic arts.

Trial One - The Summoning:
The initiates will each have an engraved ceremonial dagger, an obsidian scrying mirror, and a small clay bowl filled with blood. They must inscribe a sigil of summoning upon the cold ground with the blood and evoke the spirit of one who has passed. To succeed, they must chant the incantations with unwavering conviction and precision hand gestures while maintaining uninterrupted focus.

Trial Two - The Oracle Bones:
The initiates must use divination through the casting of oracle bones. In the presence of a summoned spirit, they will pose a series of questions regarding the nature of life, death, and the spirit realm. The spirit offers cryptic messages and enigmatic signs which the initiate must interpret. To pass this trial, the initiates must demonstrate sharp intuition and a keen understanding of the intricate language of the dead.

Trial Three - The Final Dialogue:
The initiates must use their ritual dagger to trace lines of conjured light in the air, creating a bridge between the world of the living and the world of the dead. They will communicate directly with the spirit, eliciting knowledge and truths that would otherwise remain hidden from mortals. Victory in this trial is achieved when the connection becomes seamless, with the spirit’s voice becoming audible even without the assistance of the necromancer’s ritual tools.

3. **Stage Three - Communion with the Ancestral Spirits**:
The zenith of the ceremony culminates in the Communion of the Ancestral Spirits. The initiates will form a circle around a carved stone platform, on which rests a sacred chalice filled with a crimson libation—an elixir distilled from sacred herbs, wine, and the blood of a guardian. 

The spirit of an ancient necromancer, the Initiation Master, is invoked. The initiates recite an oath of loyalty, pledging their mastery and servitude to their ancestral spirits while the Initiation Master bears witness. Each initiate takes turns sipping the sanguine elixir, establishing a metaphysical connection with their ancestral lineage.

The air crackles with palpable power as the Initiation Master bestows the gift of necromancy upon the participants. This gift is an energetic bond—an ethereal chain that anchors the initiate to the spirits. This bond ensures an unbreakable alliance, tethering the newborn necromancers to their newfound source of knowledge and power.

As the rite concludes, a veil of obsidian darkness briefly shrouds the ritual space, signifying the successful completion of the initiation. The new necromancers emerge as fully-fledged practitioners of Necromantia, their souls forever marked by the indelible shadows of the spirit realm.
