## Title: The Ethical Necromancer: A Treatise on the Moral Principles of Necromantia

Introduction

As a practitioner of Necromantia, a master of the esoteric and the occult, one must consider the profound implications of their craft. A proficient Necromancer is expected to have a deep understanding of the moral and ethical principles governing the practice, and the responsibility that comes with wielding such knowledge. This treatise aims to guide necromantic adepts through various aspects of the necromantic arts, the complexities of the ethical dilemmas they may encounter, and the delicate equilibrium that must be maintained to ensure harmony between the living and the dead.

### Section I: Summoning Spirits

The summoning of spirits lies at the core of Necromantia. It represents a direct communication with the departed souls, seeking guidance, wisdom, and insight. In pursuing this practice, one must be aware of several ethical considerations:

1. **Consent and Will**: Always respect the sanctity and autonomy of the spirit being summoned. Ensure that their presence is sought with their consent, and never force a soul to manifest against its will.
 
2. **Purpose and Intent**: A Necromancer must have clear and pure intentions when summoning spirits. It is paramount to uphold the dignity of the spirits and strive for the collective well-being of both realms. Exploit the knowledge of the departed neither for personal gratification nor for malevolence.

3. **Balance and Moderation**: Recognize that constant communication with the spirits may lead to an imbalance in the energies that keep both realms in harmony. Practice discretion and moderation. 

### Section II: Conjuring Revenants

The act of creating revenants is a powerful process that, if not approached with caution and respect, can generate havoc in both the living and the dead realms. **The following guidelines delineate the ethical standards in this practice**:

1. **Just Cause**: Only conjure a revenant for reasons grounded in cooperative assistance and not for means of control, coercion, or vindictiveness. The purpose should cater to the benefit of both realms and maintain their balance.

2. **Temporary Existence**: Understand that the existence of revenants should only be temporary. Prolonged animation can lead to unforeseen consequences in the living world and can torment the soul tethered to the revenant.

3. **Respecting the Deceased**: Exercising empathy and respect for the deceased and their loved ones is of the utmost importance. Obtain consent from the spirit and its surviving family members before raising their physical form, if possible. 

### Section III: Manipulating Souls of the Deceased

The manipulation of a soul is the most dangerous and ethically conflicting aspect of Necromantia. **We present the following recommendations to guide practitioners**:

1. **Preservation of Identity**: A Necromancer must uphold the sanctity of a soul's essence. Refrain from altering or erasing the foundational aspects of a soul's identity.

2. **Autonomy and Consent**: As with the summoning of spirits, a Necromancer must maintain respect for the autonomy of souls and avoid any manipulations without explicit consent.

3. **Avoiding Malevolence**: In manipulating a soul, never exploit it to inflict harm or suffering upon others, as this can lead to profound negativity and, ultimately, the degradation of both realms.

Conclusion

The practice of Necromantia is not a path to be taken lightly. This treatise provides a framework of ethical principles that every proficient Necromancer must adhere to in their pursuit of knowledge and mastery. By conscientiously following these guidelines, one can contribute to the greater good, exercise their powers responsibly, and maintain the delicate balance between the realms of the living and the dead. The art of Necromantia is one that requires empathy, wisdom, and restraint to be wielded effectively and ethically.
