To create a single transformative symbol that simultaneously incorporates archetypal sigils, planetary glyphs, and sacred geometry, it's essential to understand the foundations of each component and how they relate to one another. By combining these elements, the resulting symbol will convey an integrated magical intent that synthesizes elemental correspondences, astrological influences, and universal harmony for meditative contemplation by initiates.

Firstly, let's explore the key components required for this challenge:

1. ****Archetypal Sigils****: Archetypal sigils represent the abstract ideas and universal principles that govern and underpin the nature of reality. For example, a sigil may represent concepts like love, abundance, or protection. These symbols serve as focal points for the mind to tap into and unlock the energies associated with the archetype.

2. ****Planetary Glyphs****: Astrologically, planets are believed to hold specific energies and influences. Each planet corresponds to a different aspect of human experience and is generally associated with specific deities, mythologies, and archetypical qualities. Planetary glyphs are graphical representations of these energies and serve as links between the macrocosm (the cosmos) and the microcosm (individual).

3. ****Sacred Geometry****: Sacred geometry represents the underlying mathematical principles and patterns found in nature and the universe. This includes shapes like the Flower of Life, the Vesica Piscis, and the Platonic Solids. By incorporating these patterns into the transformative symbol, we establish a connection with universal principles and foster harmony with the cosmos.

Now let's dive into the step-by-step process of combining these components to create a transformative symbol:
**Step 1**: Define the Magical Intent
Before beginning, establish a clear magical intent. Determine the desired outcome, and identify any elemental correspondences, astrological influences relevant to that intent, as well as archetypal energies needed for the working.
**Step 2**: Choose an Archetypal Sigil
Select an archetypal sigil that corresponds to the magical intent. This serves as the foundation for the symbol and channels the energy of the archetype through the drawing.
**Step 3**: Identify Relevant Planetary Glyphs
Determine the planetary influences that align with your magical intent, and select the appropriate glyphs. Research the astrological associations to determine which planets are most relevant in terms of energy, mythology, and timing.
**Step 4**: Incorporate Sacred Geometry 
Choose a pattern of sacred geometry that resonates with your magical intent and aligns with the astrological and elemental aspects. This creates a powerful energetic foundation for the symbol, reinforcing the intentions of the working.
**Step 5**: Combine Elements in a Unified Design
Now, combine the archetypal sigils, planetary glyphs, and sacred geometry in a unified design that brings all the elements together. This may involve overlaying the glyphs and sigils on the sacred geometry, merging them within the design or creating a composite visual representation of all elements. Design the symbol to flow harmoniously while summarizing the essence of the desired magical intent.

In conclusion, to create a single transformative symbol that incorporates archetypal sigils, planetary glyphs, and sacred geometry, the requisite steps involve defining the magical intent, selecting the appropriate sigils and glyphs, and integrating them within a foundation of sacred geometry that resonates with the underlying philosophy of the working. The result will be a potent symbol of integrated magical intent that synthesizes elemental correspondences, astrological influences, and universal harmony for the initiate's meditative contemplation.
