Ritual Name: The Asmodean Ascendance

**Objective**: Invoke the formidable demon, Asmodeus, to seek his guidance in matters of lust and vengeance.

**Preparation**:

1. Choose an isolated location free from distractions and interruptions.
2. Cleanse the area with black salt mixed with dried mugwort and wormwood.
3. Place a black altar cloth on a table or platform to serve as your ritual space.

**Time**: The ritual must be conducted during the night of a full moon. **The most powerful hour is the Witching Hourâ€”midnight to 1**:00 am.

Sigils and symbols:

1. Draw the Sigil of Asmodeus upon your altar. The sigil represents his power and connection to the demonic realm.
2. **Emblem of the Seven-Pointed Star**: Mark this symbol on the ground to represent the seven deadly sins presided over by Asmodeus.

Incantation (pronunciation in parentheses):

"Adveniat Asmodeus, Princeps Infernalis. (Ad-ve-nee-aht As-mo-deigh-uhs, Prin-keps In-fern-al-ees)
Potestatem tuam invoco, Magister Libidinis et Ultionis. (Po-tes-taht-em too-am in-voh-koh, Mah-gees-ter Li-be-deen-ees et Ool-tee-oh-nees)
Per tenebras lunae plenae, te advoco. (Pair ten-ay-brahs loo-nigh play-neh, teh ad-vo-koh)
Sic fiat voluntati tuae, ab imis ad summa. (Seek fee-aht vo-lun-tah-tee too-ay, aab i-mis ad soom-mah)"

**Translation**:

"Come forth, Asmodeus, Infernal Prince.
I invoke your power, Master of Lust and Vengeance.
Through the darkness of the full moon, I call upon you.
So shall your will be done, from the depths to the heights."

Ingredients and offerings:

1. Six red candles - representing lust and passion.
2. Six black candles - representing vengeance and power.
3. Asmodean Incense - created by combining myrrh, frankincense, tobacco, and sultry essence.
4. A chalice filled with red wine - an offering to Asmodeus as a substitute for blood.
5. A plate containing a variety of aphrodisiacal foods - oysters, chocolate, figs, etc.

Ritual steps:

1. Begin by casting a protective circle around your ritual area using the black salt mixture, ensuring the circle is wide enough to encompass all required symbols, candles, and offerings.
2. Light the red and black candles, alternating between colors as you circle the Emblem of the Seven-Pointed Star.
3. Ignite the Asmodean Incense, allowing the aromatic smoke to fill the ritual space.
4. Stand at your altar and recite the incantation with conviction, focusing your intent on summoning the mighty Asmodeus.
5. Wait and observe. As the incense smoke swirls and dances, stay vigilant for Asmodeus's presence. He may choose to manifest himself in a variety of forms or speak through divinely inspired thoughts and ideas.
6. When you feel his presence, address your desires or questions and await his guidance.

**Closure**:

1. Once you have obtained his assistance and wisdom, humbly thank Asmodeus for his audience.
2. **Bid him farewell with the words**: "Vale, Asmodeus, Princeps Infernalis. Revertetur ad abyssos. (Farewell, Asmodeus, Infernal Prince. Return to the abyss.)"
3. Extinguish the candles, then close the protective circle by sprinkling a mixture of black salt and holy water or wine upon the circle's perimeter, repeating the words: "By my will, this circle is closed."

**Caution**: There is no guarantee for personal safety while dealing with these forces, always proceed with the utmost care and respect.
