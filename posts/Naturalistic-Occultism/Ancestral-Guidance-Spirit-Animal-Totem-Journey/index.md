description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Naturalistic Occultism, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose an intricate verse that weaves the principles of Naturalistic Occultism, calling forth the ethereal essence of one's totemic spirit animal. Include detailed descriptions of the elemental energies and ritualistic practices surrounding the summoning, as well as the mystical connection, guidance, and protection the spirit animal might bestow upon its chosen individual. To heighten the enchanting quality of the poem, incorporate complementary prose surrounding the symbolic representation of the spirit animal's habitat, attributes, and its role within the cosmic cycle.

In the shadowed grove where Selene's tears do tend,
An arcane rite takes shape, a mystic path begins.
There, whence orb√®d Luna holds her gleaming crescent,
The cast of ancient runes divines our spirits' essence.

By earthen sigil, water's vial, and the fire's mighty blaze,
The tap of sacred drum summons Nature's woven maze,
Oh, hearken now, ethereal spirits, are we still betwixt,
The winds that call the weeping trees, a whispered charm, a sacred tryst.

Our totemic vessel, unlocked, revealed,
Whilst our essence drawn in every worldly field,
For 'tis the hour when chaos turns to lore,
With earnest hearts, celestial whispers listen more.

As falling leaves of ashen bark part the veil of time,
The animal totem ascends, its celestial dance refines,
An essence brought forth from life's eternal spring,
The spirit animal's guidance, protection, truth doth bring.

In the aether of twilight's reverie grown untamed,
A luminal force reveals the depths of one's true names,
Circling 'bout the honored summoner, the spirit of grace,
Whose bonded wisdom firmly rooted in life's embrace.

And enter now the wisdom of the noble wolf drawn near,
His cavernous home has tales to tell, shared secrets yearning clear,
For bounding shadows that stalk the moonlit moors,
Hold the knowledge of survival as their sacred course.

Roaming oceans' deep embrace, the spirit dolphin's gleam,
Seen as guide in the ripples sweet, their echolocation dreams.
The clashing waves in cosmic tempo, their harmonies divine,
A wave of purpose carries forth as auroras do entwine.

Now, soar the astral wends upon the eagle's ancient wing,
Surveying sylvan vistas as a tribute to the king,
Circling 'midst the glowing stars in woven cosmic tapestry,
Divine communion takes its flight, eternities bending free.

So, in this ageless, boundless realm, the spirit animal's grace,
A pilgrimage of essence clings, the wisdom interchange,
With subtle breath and noble pulse, 'neath the night's enchanting veil,
We revere the cosmic life force of our totems' kingly trails.
