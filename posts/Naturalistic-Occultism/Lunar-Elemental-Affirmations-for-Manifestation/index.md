Seasonal and Elemental Affirmations:
As the seasons shift, integrate relevant elemental and energetical associations. Spring (Air), Summer (Fire), Autumn (Earth), and Winter (Water) align with the intent and goals related to growth, passion, grounding, and emotional healing, respectively. Create affirmations and choose corresponding sigils, herbs, and crystals that echo the elements and seasonal energies.

Adapt this framework by creating unique affirmations, sigils, and elemental correspondences to resonate with personal desires and goals. Meditate on the affirmation, sigil, and crystal and burn the chosen herb during each phase of the lunar cycle. Practice regularly, and harness the power of Naturalistic Occultism to manifest goals and desires.
