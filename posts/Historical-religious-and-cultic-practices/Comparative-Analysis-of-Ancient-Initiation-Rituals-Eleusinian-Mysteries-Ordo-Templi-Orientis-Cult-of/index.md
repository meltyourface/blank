In order to compare and contrast the Eleusinian Mysteries of ancient Greece, the rituals of the Ordo Templi Orientis, and the Egyptian cult of Osiris, we must first understand each of their historical backgrounds and the societies in which they existed. Once we have established that foundation, we will examine their initiation processes, symbolic deaths, and rebirths. Finally, we will discuss the similarities and differences of their goals and the overall effects that these practices had on their initiates and societies.

The Eleusinian Mysteries of ancient Greece were a series of religious initiations held each year in honor of the deities Demeter and her daughter Persephone. These rites were performed at the sanctuary of Eleusis, near Athens, and were a deeply secret and enigmatic series of rituals experienced only by the initiates. The exact details of the initiation process remain hidden in history, and scholars have pieced together knowledge primarily from the information that has survived in the form of artwork and literature. The mysteries aimed to provide initiates with transformative insights, and the assurance of a better fate in the afterlife.

The Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) is a modern occult organization with roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With connections to Freemasonry, its rituals have been influenced by a range of esoteric systems, most notably the teachings of the controversial figure Aleister Crowley and his spiritual system, Thelema. The OTO's initiation process is hierarchical, involving a series of degree-based rituals that emphasize the spiritual journey and development of the individual. The OTO rituals are meant to be experiential and transformative, guiding the initiate through the process of personal transformation and self-discovery.

The cult of Osiris was an important religious movement in ancient Egypt. Osiris was the god of the afterlife, the underworld, and resurrection. The cult was popular among various members of society and encompassed a variety of activities such as worship, burial rites, ceremonies, and initiation procedures. The primary goal of the cult was the assurance of a successful and positive afterlife, being connected to the deceased god-king Osiris and his anticipated resurrection.

Now that we understand the historical contexts of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Ordo Templi Orientis, and the Egyptian cult of Osiris, we can delve into their initiation processes, symbolic deaths, and rebirths.

Initiation:

Eleusinian Mysteries: This initiation process remains largely hidden; however, it is known that the ceremonies involved dancing, initiates enacting parts of a myth, and the ingestion of a sacred drink called kykeon. The Lesser Mysteries were preparatory, while the Greater Mysteries contained the core rituals of initiation.

Ordo Templi Orientis: The OTO initiation process is hierarchical, involving a series of stages that symbolize the spiritual journey from darkness to light. Each degree is a distinct ritual initiation, and each level is intended to impart different knowledge and wisdom to the initiate.

Cult of Osiris: The initiation process involved participating in various ceremonies and practices closely connected to the story of Osiris's death and resurrection. It fostered a strong sense of personal identification and connection to the god Osiris.

Symbolic Death and Rebirth:

Eleusinian Mysteries: The symbolic death and rebirth in these rituals involve the myth of Persephone's abduction by Hades and her eventual return to the world above - a metaphor for the agricultural cycle and the fertility of the earth.

Ordo Templi Orientis: Symbolic death and rebirth are central themes in OTO initiation, with Crowley's concept of "crossing the abyss" symbolically representing the death of the ego and subsequent rebirth as a spiritual being.

Cult of Osiris: Symbolic death and rebirth are depicted in the story of Osiris, who was killed and dismembered, only to be resurrected. This served as an allegory for the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

In conclusion, the Eleusinian Mysteries, the rituals of the Ordo Templi Orientis, and the Egyptian cult of Osiris share common themes in their initiation processes, symbolic deaths, and rebirths. Each group aims to facilitate a transformative experience for the initiate, resulting in a profound change in their understanding of the world and their place in it. However, the Eleusinian Mysteries were rooted in agricultural and seasonal cycles, the OTO rituals draw from a diverse range of esoteric systems and focus on individual spiritual transformation, while the cult of Osiris centers on the deity Osiris and the story of his death and resurrection. Ultimately, all three rituals sought to provide initiates with a sense of purpose, understanding, and the promise of a promising afterlife or spiritual progression.
