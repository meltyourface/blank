## I. Invocation
Hail, Saturn, King of Time, Provider of Grain,
Whose sovereignty traverses the draconian flame.
I call upon your heavenly eminence now,
With myrrh and dark crystal my humble vow,

Binding your resonance with this artful verse,
Into the tapestry of Cosmos, intertwine, immerse.

### II. The Emblematic Themes: The Golden Age
Once, a Golden Age under Saturn's reign,
Man and beast knew no strife nor pain.
Abundant harvests filled the Earth unbidden,
No toil, no labor, our needs were hidden.

In harmonious union, we sought the stars,
Astrologer's prophecies and dreams bore charge.
Alas, that time of prosperity waned,
The titan's rule faltered, creation strained.

### III. Attributes of Cronus
Cronus, ruler of Time's unyielding stride,
Many thanks for thy celestial guidance provid'd.
The scythe in thy hand, cuts the wheat and brings life,
Harvest deity, engendering abundance sans strife.

Yet, concealed by this faceted visage,
Resides the father who devoured his children in savage.

### IV. Hexagonal Storm of Saturn's North Pole
From wraithlike winds swirling, serpentine,
Formed a storm in your heart, great as divines,
A hexagonal maw, insatiable, immense,
Revealing Saturn's raging perplexed silence.

### V. Praise and Critique
In celebration of Saturn, the Golden Age's herald,
We praise that primordial peace, now imperiled.
Yet, the harsh reality of your defeat undeniable,
Ushered by Olympians, a new Pantheon viable.

Oh, father of gods, your eternal durance,
Foretold the subsequent cycles of recurrence.
In contemporary ages, we see your hand,
Cycles of power, fall of empires, rise and disband.

### VI. Merging Forms
(Time's cycle spins, ever onward, ever-flowing,
Galleries of masks worn, none truly knowing.)
[Harvest laden hands raise supplication to the skies,
Cornucopia's abundance betwixt veiled lies.]

### VII. Conclusion
Should we praise or censure Saturn's reign?
In each fiber we abide his undying claim.
For within our turbulent tempests inner,
Lie irrefutable imprints of the cosmic splinters.

Tick of the clock, bound by Time's grip
Yet, in the boundless Cosmos, mere ephemeral blip.
Thus,we weave reflection upon the macrocosmic stage,
Whence Saturn stands eternal, past the shatter'd cage.
