  Answer:
  
  Origins:
  
  1. Theban Alphabet: The Theban Alphabet, also known as the Witches' Alphabet or the Honorian Alphabet, finds its origins in the 14th century as an esoteric script attributed to the magus Honorius of Thebes. The alphabet is predominantly found in European magical traditions. It was initially utilized in magical texts like The Key of Solomon and later became popular in modern Wiccan and witchcraft traditions.
  
  2. Enochian Alphabet: The Enochian Alphabet, also known as the Angelical language, was supposedly channeled by the Elizabethan scholar and mystic John Dee through his medium Edward Kelley in the late 16th century. Dee believed that the Enochian Alphabet was the language spoken by angels and was the pre-human adamic language. The Enochian magical system eventually gained prominence through the works of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and later, Aleister Crowley in the 19th and 20th centuries.
  
  3. Celestial Alphabet: The Celestial Alphabet, or the Malachim Alphabet, is a script that appeared in the mystical grimoire known as the "Sword of Moses" dated around the 12th century. It is believed that the Celestial Alphabet was crafted by the angels and serves as a bridge between the divine and human realms, often used for talismans and magical inscriptions.
  
  Key Differences:
  
  1. Theban Alphabet: The Theban Alphabet is a substitution cipher consisting of 24 letters that correspond to the Latin alphabet, with the exception of the letters j and u. It is used primarily for inscribing magical sigils, talismans, and spells in the practice of witchcraft and Wicca.
  
  2. Enochian Alphabet: The Enochian Alphabet is a complete system of letters, associated with numerical values, unique geometric forms, and magical correspondences. It consists of 21 letters, each of which has an assigned phonetic value and elemental or astrological association. The Enochian Alphabet is the basis for the Enochian magical system which involves complex invocations, rituals, and scrying techniques to communicate with angelic beings.
  
  3. Celestial Alphabet: The Celestial Alphabet consists of 22 characters that correspond to the Hebrew alphabet. It is used for encoding and decoding messages and creating magical seals or symbols in various esoteric and occult practices.
  
  Distinct Usages:
  
  1. Theban Alphabet: As a script used primarily within Wiccan and witchcraft traditions, the Theban Alphabet lends itself well to creating written spells, sigils, and inscriptions on magical tools, amulets, and talismans.
  
  2. Enochian Alphabet: Used as a language for channeling divine wisdom, the Enochian Alphabet is crucial for engaging in Enochian Magick, which encompasses rituals, invocations, and scrying techniques to communicate with and potentially command angelic beings.
  
  3. Celestial Alphabet: The Celestial Alphabet is suited for constructing magical seals and symbols within various esoteric and occult practices. It is favored for its divine nature and angelic associations.
  
  Comprehensive Comparison:
  
  The Theban, Enochian, and Celestial alphabets share roots in esoteric and occult traditions, but their origins, key differences, and distinct usages within their respective magical practices make them suitable for different purposes in creating a well-rounded magical system or spellwork.
  
  1. In a well-rounded magical system, the Theban Alphabet could be employed when encoding spells, rituals, and inscriptions specific to witchcraft or Wiccan practices. It offers a simple substitution cipher for those who wish to keep their writings and workings concealed.
  
  2. The Enochian Alphabet is vital for practitioners of Enochian Magick, with its complex system of associations and divine connections ideal for those seeking communication and guidance from angelic beings. Additionally, this alphabet has a broader usage for ceremonial magicians seeking a rich and historically significant system.
  
  3. The Celestial Alphabet's compatibility with Hebrew and Kabbalah traditions makes it suitable for encoding messages that may benefit from this added layer of symbolism and meaning within various occult and esoteric practices.
  
  In conclusion, each alphabet has its distinct background, characteristics, and uses that make them unique choices for different aspects of a magical system or spellwork. Knowledge of these alphabets and their various implications allow a practitioner the flexibility to employ them either singularly or collectively, depending on their goals and the nature of the workings involved. Key themes include the importance of historical context, the differential uses, and the compatibility of these scripts within a wider magical practice.
