To understand the similarities and contrasts between Lovecraft's cosmic horror concepts and the traditional practice of necromancy, it is essential to first define both domains in their respective contexts.

H.P. Lovecraft is a pioneer of cosmic horror, a sub-genre of horror fiction that revolves around the insignificance and vulnerability of humankind in the vast, indifferent cosmos. In Lovecraft's literary universe, monstrous entities from beyond our comprehension, such as Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth, constantly threaten the sanity and existence of humanity. Central to cosmic horror is the idea that the fundamental nature of the universe is not only incomprehensible to humans but also actively hostile towards them.

Necromancy, on the other hand, is an ancient practice and a branch of the occult that focuses on communicating with and raising the dead. Its practitioners, known as necromancers, utilize rituals, spells, divination methods, and sometimes even alchemy in their pursuit of knowledge or to manipulate the dead to achieve particular outcomes. While necromancy has existed across various cultures throughout history, it is often associated with dark arts and black magic.

Now that we have established the definitions of Lovecraft's cosmic horror and necromancy, let us delve into the similarities and contrasts between them, as well as the connections between their themes, techniques, and underlying philosophies.

**Similarities**:
1. ****Perception of forbidden knowledge****: Both Lovecraft's cosmic horror and traditional necromancy revolve around the pursuit of knowledge deemed forbidden or dangerous. In Lovecraft's universe, protagonists and scholars typically perish or descend into madness as a result of their attempts to unravel the secrets of the cosmos, such as deciphering the ancient text "The Necronomicon." Similarly, necromancers seek forbidden knowledge by trying to communicate with the dead, even when confronted with the risks of dabbling in the supernatural.

2. ****Supernatural elements****: Both disciplines involve paranormal, supernatural, or otherworldly components that offer a sense of mystery and intrigue. Lovecraft's cosmic horror stories delve into the existence of unspeakable creatures and cosmic entities, while necromancy often features spirits, ghosts, and the afterlife.

**Contrasts**:
1. ****Scope and scale of the cosmic context****: While both cosmic horror and necromancy grapple with eldritch and macabre realities, the scope of the cosmic horror is vastly larger, both in literal geography and in philosophical terms. Cosmic horror focuses on humanity's cosmic insignificance amid an incomprehensible universe, while necromancy is rooted primarily in the earthly realm, dealing with the deceased and their connection to the living.

2. ****Human agency****: In cosmic horror, humans are often powerless against the overwhelming malevolence of unfathomable cosmic forces. In contrast, necromancers in traditional practices possess a degree of control and agency in their work, manipulating the dead and spirits through their rituals and willpower.

In conclusion, Lovecraft's cosmic horror and the traditional practice of necromancy share similarities in terms of their focus on forbidden knowledge and the supernatural. However, they contrast with regard to their respective scopes of cosmic context and the capacity for human agency within each discipline. Cosmic horror emphasizes humanity's vulnerability and insignificance in a hostile universe and the dire consequences of attempting to comprehend it. Meanwhile, necromancy empowers practitioners to manipulate the dead and gain forbidden knowledge, albeit at great personal risk. Despite their differences, both Lovecraft's cosmic horror and necromancy serve as powerful reminders of humanity's constant curiosity and the darker side of its desire to understand the seemingly incomprehensible.
