The Qlippothic Mirror is an esoteric and occult tool utilized in various forms of magick, particularly the Left-Hand Path and in working with the darker aspects of spirituality. The primary purpose of this tool is to facilitate a process of transformation by unveiling an initiate's inner darkness and facilitating their journey into the realm of Sitra Achra, the "Other Side" of existence, which stands in opposition to the divine aspect of Kabbalah's Tree of Life.

The process begins with active self-exploration and self-examination, in which the initiate investigates and confronts uncomfortable, often repressed, aspects of their being. This includes exploring one's individual desires, fears, and personal demons buried within their subconscious mind. Upon delving into the depths of their psyche, the initiate is then able to identify and isolate these aspects that have hindered their personal growth and spiritual progression.

The Qlippothic Mirror works as a catalyst for the transformation process. It is a metaphysical object that symbolizes the reflective psychic space where dark energies are confronted and grappled with. The active engagement with the mirror allows the initiate to observe their own reactions, projections, and triggers, as well as begin to disassemble and dismantle these aspects of themselves that have remained hidden or obstructed.

In the context of Sitra Achra, the Qlippothic Mirror helps the initiate establish a connection with the darker forces and energies within themselves, fostering a dynamic relationship with the qliphotic realms and entities. There are ten primary qliphotic spheres, each with its own corresponding realm and associated entities:

1. **Thaumiel - Dual Contending Force**: Corresponding to Kether on the Tree of Life, Thaumiel is associated with the dualistic nature of existence. It represents the forces of chaos and division, as well as the meeting point between the individual and the divine.
 
2. **Ghagiel - The Hinderers**: Linked to Chokmah, Ghagiel focuses on hindrances and obstacles in life, presenting challenges for initiates to overcome through self-knowledge and personal power.

3. **Sathariel - Concealment**: Related to Binah, it represents concealment, illusions, and the mysteries that shroud spiritual and personal truths.

4. **Gha'asthshaar - Destroying Demons**: Associated with Chesed, it symbolizes the destructive and chaotic forces that tear down societal rules and the established order, pushing the individual to break from the constraints of mainstream society.

5. **Golachab - Fiery Arrows**: Corresponding to Geburah, this realm deals with the transformative power of destruction, particularly in the form of fiery energies, anger, and the purging of unwanted aspects within oneself.

6. **Gamaliel - Obscene Ones**: Linked to Tiphereth, it is related to liberation from societal norms and taboos, embracing one's desires and passions.

7. **Harab Serapel - Burning Angels**: Connected to Netzach, it represents the transformation and purification through the forces of lust, love, and desire to fuel spiritual progression.

8. **Samael - Poison of God**: Related to Hod, it is about utilizing deception, cunning, and and illusions of reality to manipulate and control one's environment for personal gain.

9. **Gamchicoth - Devourers**: Corresponding to Yesod, it symbolizes the power of dreams, visions, and primordial, chaotic instincts, ultimately unearthing deeper truths regarding the nature of reality.

10. **Lilith - The Night Specter**: Linked to Malkuth, Lilith's sphere is connected to sexuality, passion, rebellion, and the desire to break free from restrictions and limitations to gain personal autonomy.

As the initiate journeys through these realms, working with the energies and entities of the qliphotic realms, they assimilate the lessons and power within each sphere, ultimately leading to increased self-awareness, personal power, and spiritual mastery.

In conclusion, the Qlippothic Mirror serves as a powerful tool for transformation and self-discovery through engaging with one's inner darkness. It is a significant part of the initiation process within the context of Sitra Achra, allowing the practitioner to form a connection with the darker aspects of reality and work with the ten primary qliphotic realms and their corresponding entities. This journey fosters an individual's growth, empowerment, and understanding of the complexities of both the light and dark elements of existence.
