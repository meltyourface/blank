Demon: Barbatos, the 8th Demon of the Goetic practice, Duke of the infernal realms

**Domain of Influence**: Barbatos is known for his abilities to understand animals, reveal hidden treasure, and assist in uncovering the secrets of the universe.

The Barbatos Invocation Ritual:

**Preparation**:
1. Select a conducive location for the ritual, preferably a quiet and secluded natural environment.
2. Determine the precise time and date to perform the ritual; the most potent being when the sun is in Sagittarius or when the moon is waxing gibbous.
3. **Gather the necessary materials**: a pentacle or talisman inscribed with the sigil of Barbatos, incense (sandalwood or pine), candles (green or gold), a chalice or cup filled with wine, a horn or musical instrument, and an offering (crystal or precious metals).

The Ritual:
1. Initialize the ritual by casting a protective circle. This can be done using salt, a wand, or even through visualization. 
2. Light the candles and incense, and place them in the appropriate cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West) around the circle to invoke the elemental powers.
3. Holding the pentacle or talisman, recite the following invocation to summon Barbatos:

"O mighty Duke Barbatos, hear my call
In your presence, the secrets of the universe shall be unveiled
Through your guidance, treasures long hidden shall come to light
Your powers align with the stars as I call upon you this night.

I call upon the spirits, guardians, and guides
To witness this communion at the sacred divide
Barbatos, I beseech thee, my humble request
Enlighten my path and grant me your manifest.

By the powers of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water
By the center within which all elements gather
I invoke thee, Barbatos, Duke of the Infernal Realms
Align with my energies and be present in this sacred space."

4. Play the horn or musical instrument to further invite the presence of Barbatos, as he is known to appreciate the harmonies of the natural world.

5. Once his presence is felt, present the offering and communicate your desires respectfully and confidently.

6. Thank Barbatos for his assistance, and raise the chalice high, drinking to his honor.

7. **Bid farewell to Barbatos and the elemental powers by reciting**:

"My gratitude abounds, O mighty Duke Barbatos,
For the revelations and wisdom, you have bestowed
As the elements disperse, my tribute has been paid
With reverence and respect, our communion shall not fade."

8. Extinguish the candles and incense, symbolizing the closing of the ritual.

9. Remove the protective circle and clear away all materials.

10. Spend some time meditating on the experience, integrating the knowledge and energies gained during the communion with Barbatos.

Remember, while performing the ritual, remain focused and respectful. This detailed invocation of Barbatos within the Western Mantic Skull tradition aims to maximize effectiveness while prioritizing the protection of the practitioner.
