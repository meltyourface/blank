To craft this talisman dedicated to invoking the mysteries of Babalon, follow these steps:

1. Gather materials: Firstly, gather the materials required for creating this talisman. This includes a metal or clay chalice to represent the divine feminine and union of duality, a suitable base for the talisman, tools for carving or etching symbols, garnet and carnelian gemstones, and materials for sacred offerings such as incense, candles, and libations.

2. Symbols and sigils: Once the materials are assembled, begin by carving or etching the distinct esoteric symbols attributed to Babalon onto the base of the talisman. These may include the Seal of Tiamat, representing primordial chaos and creation and the Holy Mark, which symbolizes the Great Mother Goddess. Place these symbols in a circular arrangement around the central chalice.

3. Incorporate the chalice: Choose or create a chalice that represents the divine feminine and the union of duality. The chalice can be made of metal, such as silver or gold, or a natural material like clay. Place the chalice at the center of the talisman as the focal point, with the various symbols surrounding it.

4. Add gemstones: Select garnet and carnelian gemstones, which resonate with the energies of passion, sensuality, and manifestation. Set them upon the talisman base, near the symbols and the chalice. Their arrangement can be symmetric, following the design of the talisman, or you may choose to set them intuitively.

5. Consecration ritual: Prepare for the consecration ritual with a clean and sacred space. Light candles and incense to set a suitable atmosphere.

6. Invocation: Begin by invoking the presence of Babalon, addressing her with names and titles relevant to her mysteries. Speak or chant your intention to dedicate the talisman to her, asking for her participation and guidance in the ritual.

7. Offerings: Present your offerings to Babalon, such as incense, candles, and libations. These could include wine, honey, or milk. Explain your intentions, asking that she blesses and empowers the talisman to connect with her energy.

8. Meditation: Meditate on the energies of Babalon, the divine feminine, and the union of duality. Visualize the talisman glowing with her power and ask that it serves as a conduit to her mysteries.

9. Activation: When you feel ready, pass the talisman through the candle flame, the incense smoke, and sprinkle it with the libations, symbolically cleansing and charging it through each of the elements. As you do so, say a prayer or affirmation confirming the completion of the talisman's consecration and activation.

10. Closing and storage: Thank Babalon for her presence and participation in the ritual. Close the ritual with an appropriate gesture or words and treat the talisman with reverence. Keep it in a safe and honored place when not actively using it for meditation or magical workings.

By following these steps meticulously and investing your focus and intention, you will have crafted and empowered a talisman that will become a powerful tool in exploring and invoking the mysteries of Babalon, the divine feminine, and the union of duality inherent in the cosmos.
