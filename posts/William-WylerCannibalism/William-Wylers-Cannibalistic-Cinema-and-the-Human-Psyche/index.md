In shadows cast upon the screen
A master's touch, William Wyler's scene
His tales unfolds as darkness weaves,
In cannibalistic rituals, his art perceives.

Oh, ye spectators, come and bear witness
From the depths of his twisted mind, unearth the abyss
Delve into the intricacies of the macabre
Your psyche changed, you cannot dislodge.

'Cannibalism,' whispered his voice so clear,
'A taboo hidden in the darkest sphere.'
As the camera rolls, and the frames unfold
Wyler's stories are grimly told.

An eerie dance of primal urge
Under the gory moon, strange beings emerge
In frenzied feasts of human flesh,
An ancient hunger for blood refreshed.

From the haunted halls of 'The Collector,' we speak
Human possession, a mystery so bleak.
A twisted desire, an urge to take,
A cannibalistic bond, none could break.

With 'Ben-Hur,' a rebellion filled with rage,
Not cannibals in flesh, but in action and stage.
Power-hungry mortals; devouring brothers
Feasting upon the defeat of others.

And what of the beasts in 'The Children's Hour'?
A web of lies, a taste so sour.
A cannibalism of reputation and heart,
Wyler's haunting gaze, a foreboding art.

In 'Mrs. Miniver,' a war waged within,
As families starve, a desperate sin.
An act concealed by hardships dire,
In desperate want, hidden desires lie.

The sociopolitical implications, they rise,
Horrifying truth staring into our eyes.
United as one, they tear down the charade,
A testimonial to the Wyler Cannibalism Parade.

From rituals to lies, the evolution of the taboo,
Wyler's vision, our collective prophecy, as a society, we must construe.
A cultural complexity, a shocking revelation,
The vicious cycle of self-consumption, our very foundation.

As we face our desires, irrational, innate,
Dare we unmask the monstrosity of our fate?
In Wyler's shadows, we must dare to tread,
For cannibalism in us all, a seed of dread.
