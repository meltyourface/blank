Delving into the enigmatic realm of Necromantic Goetic spirits, I have deciphered the hidden meanings behind cryptic phrases found in the ancient Goetic grimoires: Liber Samekh, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum.

1. Liber Samekh:
Liber Samekh is a ritual written by Aleister Crowley for the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel, a key component in Goetic practices. Key phrases deciphered in the text illuminate the process of summoning the Guardian Angel:

a) "Thee I invoke, the Bornless One. Thee that didst create the Earth and the Heavens..."
This phrase represents the initial invocation, drawing the Bornless One's attention to the practitioner, and acknowledging their connection to the practitioner's spiritual journey.

b) "Thou art Asar Un-Nefer, my Lord of Breath!"
The practitioner identifies themselves with Asar Un-Nefer – the god Osiris in his perfected form – proclaiming their spiritual awakening and commitment to mastering the necromantic arts.

c) "...make right magical equilibrium in me!"
A request to balance magical energies within the practitioner, enabling them to move forward with the ritual without being overwhelmed by the spirit's presence.

2. The Lesser Key of Solomon:
The Lesser Key of Solomon, attributed to King Solomon, outlines the conjuring of 72 spirits using specific sigils and rituals. Key deciphered phrases imply ways to enhance summoning and control:

a) "Beralanensis, Baldachiensis, Paumachiae, and Apologiae Sedes, by the most mighty Kings and powers..."
These words invoke powerful rulers who control the four quarters of the Earth, aligning the magician's intent with those rulers to ensure smooth interactions with the summoned spirits.

b) "In the Name of [Deity], I declare that the Spirit [Name] shall be obedient unto the command of this Circle..."
This phrase emphasizes the obedience of the spirit to the practitioner and strengthens the binding of the spirit within the circle's constraints.

c) "O Lord, give me the power to bind and control these Spirits, that they may do my commands..."
The practitioner appeals for divine assistance to strengthen their control over the spirits, furthering their mastery of the necromantic arts.

3. Pseudomonarchia Daemonum:
The Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, written by Johann Weyer, lists 69 spirits with descriptions, sigils, and their specific powers. Key phrases deciphered within the text enhance the knowledge in summoning and understanding the spirits:

a) "He that is their chief and king, ruling by the space of forty legions..."
Knowing the hierarchy of the spirits, practitioners can summon specific entities and invoke their powers and influence accordingly.

b) "...having six hundred and sixty-six legions of devils under his command..."
This phrase symbolizes the vast and formidable legions under the Lower King, reinforcing the position of the practitioner over these spirits.

c) "Every one of these spirits, in order of their legions, have under them others inferior..."
This statement highlights the existence of a hierarchical structure among Goetic spirits, allowing practitioners to better navigate and control their interactions with various spirits.

In conclusion, careful analysis and deciphering of the cryptic phrases found in Liber Samekh, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum unveil the obscured knowledge of conjuring, summoning, and controlling Necromantic Goetic spirits. Understanding the underlying connections between the phrases and intricate Goetic rituals, as well as the symbolic representations and sigils associated with each spirit, enhances one's mastery of the necromantic arts.
