In order to answer this knowledge challenge comprehensively, it is necessary to understand the origins and nature of the Goetic spirits, their traditional demonic associations, and their role in necromantic practices, as well as potential ramifications and moral implications.

First, let's establish the context of the 72 Goetic spirits. These spirits are part of the "Goetia," which is derived from a Greek term referring to the practice of sorcery. The Goetia is a section of a 17th-century grimoire, "The Lesser Key of Solomon", which has its roots in texts from the 14th and 15th centuries and draws heavily upon older demonological and magical traditions. The 72 spirits are said to be demons, fallen angels, or spirits with various associated abilities, characteristics, and legions of minions under their control.

The primary differences between the traditional demonic associations of the Goetic spirits and their role in aiding necromantic practices can be explored through three aspects: purpose, process, and the nature of interactions.

1. Purpose:
Traditionally, the Goetic demons were invoked for a wide range of purposes, such as bestowing knowledge, granting power, dictating events, inciting love, and manipulating global affairs. In the context of necromancy, their purpose is much more focused on facilitating communication with the deceased or harnessing the energies and knowledge of those spirits.

2. Process:
In both cases, invocation and evocation of Goetic spirits require the magician to follow specific rituals and procedures outlined in the "Lesser Key of Solomon" as well as other related texts. However, while traditional Goetic rituals can be performed to attain worldly desires or individualistic goals, in necromantic practices, rituals are specifically designed to appeal to the nature and abilities of Goetic spirits known for their expertise in controlling or communing with the dead.

3. Nature of Interactions:
Traditionally, practitioners interact with the Goetic spirits using a master-servant dynamic, often employing various safeguards and constraints to maintain control and ensure spirits do not cause them any harm. In necromantic practices, the interactions may focus more on building relationships and fostering a closer alliance with spirits associated with death and the afterlife, making some aspects more collaborative in nature.

Now, let's consider the potential ramifications and moral implications of intentionally invoking Goetic spirits for communion with the deceased.

1. Ethical Concerns:
Invoking Goetic spirits to communicate with the dead can be considered morally problematic as it can potentially disturb the peace and rest of the deceased, or infringe upon their agency and free will. It may also be seen as an attempt to bypass the natural order or the boundaries between life and death.

2. Personal Ramifications:
A practitioner who communicates with Goetic spirits can experience spiritual, mental, or even physical consequencesâ€”especially if protective measures are not taken or if the entities are not properly controlled. Exposure to malevolent influences or a loss of personal agency can result if a practitioner becomes too trusting or reliant on the spirits.

3. Socio-cultural Implications:
Invoking Goetic spirits can also run counter to various religious beliefs and societal norms that discourage attempting to manipulate or communicate with the deceased. Engaging with these spirits can lead to ostracization, stigma, or even legal consequences in some communities.

In conclusion, the primary differences between traditional demonic associations of the 72 Goetic spirits and their role in aiding necromantic practices lie in the distinct purposes for invocation, specific processes involved, and the nature of interactions between the spirits and practitioners. Intentionally invoking these spirits for communion with the deceased raises moral and ethical concerns related to personal ramifications, ethical considerations, and the potential impact on the wider socio-cultural context.
