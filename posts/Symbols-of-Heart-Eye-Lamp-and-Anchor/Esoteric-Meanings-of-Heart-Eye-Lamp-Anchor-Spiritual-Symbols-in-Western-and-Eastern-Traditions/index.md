In order to compare and contrast the esoteric meanings of the Symbols of Heart, Eye, Lamp, and Anchor in both Western and Eastern occult traditions, we must first have a profound understanding of the respective symbols and their significance in these distinct traditions. This essay will traverse through the explanations of each symbol, their differences and similarities, and their connections to spiritual transformation and illumination. Finally, we will explore how these connections can be applied in daily life for personal growth and self-awareness.

1. The Heart
In Western occult traditions, the Heart represents love, passion, and the divine center of a person. It is often associated with spiritual devotion and the connection between emotions and thoughts. It is regarded as a symbol of the soul and is intimately connected with the concept of divine love and compassion. In Christianity, for example, the Sacred Heart of Jesus is an important symbol of divine love and the compassion of Christ.

In Eastern occult traditions, the Heart is similarly associated with love, compassion, and spiritual devotion. In Buddhism, the heart is connected to the concept of bodhicitta, which is the compassionate wish to attain enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings. In Hinduism, the heart chakra (Anahata) is the center of love, compassion, and harmony.

2. The Eye
In Western occultism, the Eye is seen as a symbol of perception, wisdom, and divine insight. The All-Seeing Eye or the Eye of Providence, symbolizes God's omniscient presence and is often depicted within Christian, Freemasonry, and Hermetic traditions. The Eye is also connected to the spiritual concept of opening the 'Third Eye' to awaken deeper spiritual consciousness and perception.

In Eastern traditions, the Eye is also considered a symbol of insight, wisdom, and perception. The Third Eye (Ajna) chakra in Hinduism is viewed as the center of intuition and foresight, while Buddhism associates spiritual awakening and wisdom with the Eye, particularly with the concept of the Buddha's Dharma Eye, which symbolizes the ability to perceive the ultimate truth directly.

3. The Lamp
The Lamp, in Western esotericism, is a symbol of spiritual illumination and divine guidance. It is representative of the inner light that guides our soul. Lamps and candles are often utilized in various rituals and ceremonies in Christian, Gnostic, and Hermetic practices.

In Eastern philosophies, the Lamp is also symbolic of spiritual illumination. In Buddhism, the metaphor of lighting a lamp is used to describe the process of achieving enlightenment and the spread of wisdom. Similarly, in Hinduism, the lamp (deepa) represents inner light, knowledge, and the dispelling of ignorance.

4. The Anchor
In Western occultism, the Anchor symbolizes hope, stability, and grounding in spiritual matters. The Anchor reminds practitioners to remain steadfast in their spiritual path, despite the challenges they face. In Christian mythology, the anchor is also associated with hope and a firm connection with the divine.

Eastern traditions have less prominent associations with the symbol of the Anchor. However, there are loose parallels with concepts of grounding and stability, such as the root chakra (Muladhara) in Hinduism, which represents stability and grounding in one's spiritual journey, and the Buddhist principle of remaining grounded in mindfulness and equanimity amidst the turbulence of life.

Now that we have explored the esoteric meanings of the Symbols of Heart, Eye, Lamp, and Anchor in both Western and Eastern traditions, we can assess how they relate to spiritual transformation and illumination. All four symbols are connected to the spiritual awakening of the practitioner, highlighting the significance of love, compassion, wisdom, perception, spiritual guidance, inner light, and grounding in the path towards enlightenment.

To apply these connections in daily life for personal growth and self-awareness, we can follow these recommendations:

1. Cultivate love and compassion towards oneself and others, practicing acts of kindness and understanding to further open the Heart.
2. Enhance one's spiritual perception and wisdom through meditation, spiritual study, and connecting with inner guidance from the Eye.
3. Foster spiritual illumination by nurturing the inner light, pursuing truth, and seeking guidance from the wisdom traditions associated with the Lamp.
4. Stay grounded and focused on the spiritual journey by anchoring oneself in hope, remaining steadfast in adversity, and prioritizing spiritual advancement over material pursuits, embodying the Anchor's symbolism.

In summary, the Symbols of Heart, Eye, Lamp, and Anchor are rich in esoteric meaning across both Western and Eastern occult traditions. Despite differences in cultural contexts and symbols, they share core themes of spiritual transformation and illumination. Through understanding these symbols and consciously integrating their principles into our daily lives, we can achieve personal growth, self-awareness, and spiritual awakening.
