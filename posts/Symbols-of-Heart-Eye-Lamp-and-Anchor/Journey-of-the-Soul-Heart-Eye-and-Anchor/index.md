In the caverns of my heart profound,
An ocean of emotions I found,
Where Eye doth glance depths beneath,
To explore the fears that lie in sheath.

Like an Anchor, steady and true,
To hold me fast in storms and blue,
Symbolic strength of rooted mind,
In tempest’s wake, the peace I find.

Eye's sight pierces the shadowed veil,
Revealing truths that shadows fail,
Searching every corner of my soul,
The Lamp doth guide, illuminating, whole.

The Lamp, the guiding light of faith,
Dispels the gloom with golden wraith,
Its radiance, warm compass of the heart,
Shedding wisdom for my journey’s start.

Eye gazes deep where currents seethe,
Discerns the thoughts, the hidden weave;
Decipher sense from a web of lies,
The truths that bind, the heart espies.

The Anchor rises as I flee,
From mines unknown, set myself free,
With Lamp's glow, I venture unbound,
Winged flight, soul’s path finally found.

Heart swells and burns with passion true,
As Lamp reveals the spiritual hue,
A fusion of clarity and insight unite,
Intoxicating mix, transcendent flight.

One final dive, the Heart outgrown,
Knowledge, love, an inextricable stone,
Eye, Lamp, and Anchor, symbols three,
United in growth, forever free.
