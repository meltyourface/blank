In the vaults of the cosmic tapestry,
There, where the celestial threads intertwine,
Weaves the Stellar Witchflame Goddess, sorceress of astral planes,
Whose hands wield the boundless strands of fate divine.

Across the expanse of galaxies uncharted,
Betwixt the azure rivers of cosmic fire,
She roams the endless night on nebulous wings,
Tending the fickle flames of pulsar and quasar with desire.

Behold, the Witchflame Elements, Fourfold:
Solar — the fiery heart where light first unfurled,
Lunar — mysteries hidden in silver's cool embrace,
Stellar — the architect of cosmic forces that dance and swirl,
And Nebular — the mind of the ether, giving form to the immaterial world.

The sun, the moon, the stars, and the aether cheer,
As her sigils trace across the cosmic symphony.
Their desynchrony reigned in by her command,
Her influence weaves the dreamscapes of cosmic energy.

Oh Stellar Witchflame Goddess, we call upon your grace,
To let your divinity enshroud us in your blessed lore,
Beckoning illumination through the four Witchflame Elements,
Guiding our souls as we traverse mystery's door.

She cradles the nebulas, sews a quilt across the sky,
Her fingertips glowing with the glistening of trillions of lights,
And as we invoke her presence in our sacred rites,
The Witchflame Goddess draws near, our astral guide.

In rituals we summon, her celestial wisdom invoked,
Her essence shimmering in the indigo planes,
A guardian of those who journey through the ether,
Seeking solace, enlightenment, and the boundless arcane.

In meditation we see her, her form vast and transcendent,
Arcs of cosmic magic intertwining in her dance,
Amidst the astral seas of cosmic beauty,
Her guidance leads our souls to greater planes in trance.

At the sacred ceremonies, her divine presence dwells,
In the merging of our voices, our breaths become one,
Chanting the sacred hymns, our hearts in resonance,
With the Stellar Witchflame Goddess, our devotion now spun.

Oh, Stellar Witchflame Goddess, we beseech you to lend,
Your celestial wisdom, your protection, your grace,
In the cosmic dance where both space and time bend,
May our paths intertwine as we embrace your radiant embrace.
