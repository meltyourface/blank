Throughout history, the intersections of cultural norms, occult practices, and technological advancements have led to profound changes in human societies. **Key technological developments have been met with a variety of reactions across historical contexts -- at times inspiring awe and reverence, while at others inciting fear and suspicion. In examining the intricate interplay between these elements, three pivotal technological advancements stand out**: the printing press, the steam engine, and the internet.

1. The Printing Press

The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century marked a significant turning point in human history. It enabled the mass production and dissemination of written materials, directly challenging the status quo of the time -- a society where access to knowledge and spiritual practices was tightly controlled by the clergy and the ruling classes.

The printing press played a key role in the spread of esoteric and occult ideologies, which were often perceived as dangerous or subversive by the societal elites. The availability of occult texts, such as the grimoires containing magical formulae and rituals, contributed to the burgeoning interest in hermeticism, alchemy, and other esoteric pursuits.

Cultural norms regarding appropriate knowledge and spiritual practice were challenged by these texts, leading to a widespread fear of diabolical influences among the population. For example, the witch trials of the Early Modern period were due in part to the dissemination of pamphlets and books that fueled hysteria and suspicion about witchcraft and its purported practitioners. Hidden power structures emerged as certain occult groups capitalized on the panic, using the opportunity to amass influence and resources.

2. The Steam Engine

The advent of the steam engine in the 18th century dramatically transformed societies through the Industrial Revolution. This technology enabled immense leaps in industries such as transportation, manufacturing, and energy production. As the predominantly agrarian societies of the past rapidly morphed into urban and industrial centers, new social structures and norms began to take shape.

Amidst these rapid changes, the occult and the esoteric found new breeding grounds. Spiritualism and the practice of s√©ances, which sought to communicate with the deceased, gained popularity in the Victorian era. The steam-driven machinery and the telegraph, as precursors to modern communications technology, seemed to hold the promise of connection not only between humans but also with other realms and beings.

In this shifting societal landscape, the occult became both a means of wielding power and control, as well as a source of comfort and solace for those left disoriented by the breakneck pace of industrial development. Groups like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn emerged as key players, operating within the interstices of the new order, and shaping it in subtle ways.

3. The Internet

The rise of the internet has irrevocably altered the landscape of human communication, information access, and social organization. The global connectivity provided by the World Wide Web has accelerated the spread of both mainstream and alternative ideas, offering fertile ground for new occult and esoteric practices to thrive.

Digital communication technologies have given rise to new forms of ritual, community, and knowledge dissemination in occult circles. Online forums, social media platforms, and even virtual reality spaces have become important venues for practitioners to share their experiences and perform magical workings together, transcending geographical boundaries.

The internet has also magnified the scope and reach of existing power structures, as both adherents and detractors of the occult wield this technological tool to propagate their messages, manipulate public opinion, and pursue their objectives. Cybermagick, for example, denotes the fusion of technology and magical practice, exploiting the digital realm's information flows to achieve specific outcomes or influence events.

In conclusion, throughout history, the interactions between cultural norms, occult practices, and key technological developments have given rise to complex, multi-layered dynamics in human societies. Critical examination of such pivotal advancements as the printing press, the steam engine, and the internet reveals just how intricately entwined these elements have been, in influencing and shaping our world.
