To answer this knowledge challenge, let us first familiarize ourselves with the key concepts, and then understand each role of Manannán mac Lir in relation to the others. Finally, we will explore how these aspects converge and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of his influence on human interactions with the supernatural world.

Manannán mac Lir is an Irish Celtic god associated with the sea, the Otherworld, and mystical knowledge. The Celts were a diverse group of tribes that inhabited much of Europe during ancient times and had a complex belief system that encompassed many gods and deities. The sea, in Celtic mythology, represents mystery, danger, and renewal. The Otherworld is an alternate realm (often accessed through bodies of water) where the souls of the dead, supernatural beings, and gods reside. Mystical knowledge refers to a deeper understanding of the universe and the forces that govern it, often learned through initiation into esoteric practices or direct revelation from deities.

Now, let us examine each of Manannán mac Lir's roles individually:

1. As the god of the sea, Manannán mac Lir has dominion over the vast and mysterious waters that surround the Celtic lands. He is often depicted riding on a chariot pulled by sea creatures, wielding a sword that represents the crashing waves. The sea's transformative and unpredictable nature is a metaphor for the constant change in life and can be seen as a bridge to the Otherworld. By mastering the oceans, Manannán mac Lir is a guide for sailors and symbolizes safe passage on both literal and spiritual journeys.

2. As the ruler of the Otherworld, Manannán mac Lir presides over the realm of spirits, ancestors, and other supernatural beings. This world exists parallel to our own and can be accessed through various means, such as visiting sacred places or entering a state of altered consciousness. Manannán mac Lir controls the borders between the worlds and maintains a balance between the mortal and supernatural realms. He is intimately connected with cycles of life, death, and rebirth, making him a powerful figure in both myth and ritual.

3. Finally, as the god of mystical knowledge, Manannán mac Lir is a dispenser of wisdom and insight, teaching his followers the secrets of magic, prophecy, and other esoteric arts. As such, he acts as a spiritual mentor, providing guidance in attaining a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it. By mastering these arts, one can harness the power to manipulate reality and potentially gain access to the Otherworld, further reinforcing Manannán mac Lir's connections to both the sea and the land beyond.

Now that we have thoroughly analyzed Manannán mac Lir's roles, let's consider how these aspects converge and contribute to our understanding of his influence on human interactions with the supernatural world.

The convergence of Manannán mac Lir's roles can be seen in his function as a spiritual guide and protector of the boundaries between worlds. Through his dominion over the sea and Otherworld, he facilitates communication and interaction between mortals and supernatural beings. This enables individuals to learn from these encounters and gain access to hidden realms, perfecting their spiritual and magical skills under his tutelage. Consequently, Manannán mac Lir impacts human interactions with the supernatural world by serving as a mediator, mentor, and source of wisdom for those willing to embark on the journey of self-discovery.

In conclusion, Manannán mac Lir's roles as the god of the sea, the Otherworld, and mystical knowledge converge and complement one another, granting him a unique status within the Irish Celtic pantheon. His influence on human interactions with the supernatural world is profound as he acts as a bridge between realms, a teacher of esoteric practices, and a protector and guide for both sailors and spiritual seekers. By understanding Manannán mac Lir's multifaceted nature, we can appreciate the complexity of Celtic mythology and gain insight into the ancient world's beliefs and traditions.
