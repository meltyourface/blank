To begin answering this knowledge challenge, we must first break down and understand the key components involved: the seven classical planets, the pillars of Solomon's Temple, and the seven chakras. Next, we will explore the hermetic correspondence between these three components, and finally, we will establish their mystical interconnection through the harmonizing principles of macrocosm and microcosm.

1. The Seven Classical Planets
The seven classical planets, according to the astrological and cosmological perspective of the ancient world, consisted of the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. These celestial objects were revered by many civilizations throughout history and held mystical significance. Each planet was associated with specific divine energies or archetypes, providing a cosmic map for the spiritual and psychological understanding of the universe and its inhabitants. 

2. Pillars of Solomon's Temple
In Freemasonry and various esoteric traditions, the pillars of Solomon's Temple hold a significant symbolic meaning. These pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, represent the establishment and stability of heaven and earth, exemplifying the duality between strength and wisdom. They are often interpreted as doorways between the physical world and the spiritual plane.

3. The Seven Chakras
The seven major chakras, in Hinduism and yogic traditions, are vital energy centers within the human body that regulate life force energy (prana) and correspond to distinct spiritual qualities. Arranged along the spine, they are denoted as Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddha, Ajna, and Sahasrara.

Now, let's examine the hermetic correspondence between these three components and link them through the principles of macrocosm (the universe) and microcosm (human existence).

The seven classical planets align symbolically with the two pillars and the seven chakras. Jachin and Boaz correspond to the Sun (representing the masculine, active principle) and the Moon (representing the feminine, receptive principle). This duality is also reflected in the Ida and Pingala nadis (energy channels) intertwined along the Sushumna nadi (the central channel), connecting the chakras. 

The remaining five planets are associated with the five chakras between the Sun and the Moon (or the first and the seventh chakra). Mars with Muladhara (representing energy, action, and willpower), Mercury with Svadhisthana (communication and intellect), Jupiter with Manipura (expansion and power), Venus with Anahata (love and beauty), and Saturn with Vishuddha (limitation and structure). 

This correlation signifies the esoteric principle "as above, so below," meaning that the human body microcosm is a reflection of the celestial macrocosm. Here, we find the harmonizing principles that substantiate the mystical interconnection of these three components.

In conclusion, the hermetic correspondence between the seven classical planets, the pillars of Solomon's Temple, and the seven chakras is revealed through their shared symbolism and the interwoven nature of human and celestial energies. The harmonizing principles of macrocosm and microcosm exemplify the interconnectedness of the universe and human existence, bringing profound insights and understanding to initiates and seekers of esoteric knowledge.
