Meticulously examining primary sources and ancient texts, I have delved into the labyrinthine depths of arcane lore to unearth the veiled connections between magical practices from diverse cultures. Engaging in comparative analysis of esoteric rituals, sigils, and incantations, I have identified commonalities and disparities in both methodology and intent.

A striking similarity I found is the existence of a protective symbol - Egyptian Eye of Horus, Norse runes, specifically Algiz, and Mayan glyphs representing the gods of protection. Each of these symbols was considered powerful and able to ward off negativity or evil energy in their respective societies.

Additionally, these cultures each employed their unique alphabet when performing incantations and casting spells within their rituals. For the Egyptians, this alphabet was a system of hieroglyphs; for the Norse, it was the runic alphabet, and for the Mayans, it was their own hieroglyphic writing system. The incantations were performed with the intention of invoking specific energies, be it for protection, healing, or success.

Furthermore, diverse cultures often placed emphasis on the significance of understanding and exploiting hidden forces, whether in the form of elemental magic, astral travel, or psychic abilities. This belief in accessing a secret source of power lies at the heart of many occult traditions.

Upon evaluating the extent of influence that such mystical symbols as the Egyptian Eye of Horus, the Norse runes, and the Mayan hieroglyphs exerted upon their respective societies, it becomes clear that these symbols permeated all aspects of life, from religious ceremonies to everyday charms for protection and fertility. They were integral to the fabric of these societies, shaping their cultural identities and spiritual expressions.

The potential convergence points among these diverse magical systems lie in their shared belief in harnessing unseen forces and utilizing symbolism to access this hidden knowledge. The potency attributed to symbols and their ability to encapsulate complex concepts and profound spiritual truths across cultures further underscores the universality of this connection.

In conclusion, synthesizing these findings into a cohesive thesis elucidating the underlying unity of the world's occult traditions, one can unravel the tenebrous skeins that pervade the annals of human spirituality. The common thread that links these diverse cultures and their magical practices is the inherent belief in an unseen world of power and wisdom that can be accessed through the use of potent symbols and rituals. This echoes the enduring desire for transcendent understanding and a connection to something greater than oneself, which has defined the human experience throughout history.
