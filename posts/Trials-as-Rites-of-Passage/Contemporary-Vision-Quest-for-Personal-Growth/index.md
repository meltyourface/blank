## Ascension of the Spirit

**Objective**: To facilitate a contemporary rite of passage for individuals transitioning into a new stage of life.

**Influences**: Traditional vision quests, ancient rites of passage, modern technology, and communion with nature.

### I. Preparation Phase

1. Fasting (3 days) - The participant will undergo a fasting period prior to the rite of passage. It allows them to focus their intentions and energies on their spiritual growth and inner transformation.

2. Isolation (1 week) - The individual will spend one week in solitude to contemplate their purpose, goals, and aspirations for their new stage of life. This process will bring forth clarity and direction for the journey ahead.

3. Technological Disconnect (1 week) - During isolation, the participant will be disconnected from modern technology (internet, cell phones, etc.) to free their minds from distractions and enhance their connection with nature.

### II. Visionary Phase

1. Journey Into Nature (3 days) - Guided by a shaman or spiritual mentor, the participant will embark on a physical journey through nature, which symbolizes their passage to a new spiritual level. They will traverse a set path, spending each day hiking and immersing themselves in the natural environment.

2. Vision Quest (2 nights) - The participant will spend two nights alone in a sacred location, like a mountaintop, desert, or forest, in deep meditation, connecting with their spiritual essence. The individual may use technology, such as a portable star projector, to enhance their connection with the cosmos.

### III. Integration Phase

1. Ancestral Knowledge (1 day) - The participant will engage with the shaman or spiritual mentor to learn traditional knowledge, wisdom, and practices through storytelling and shared experiences. This will enable the individual to pass on their learnings to future generations.

2. Artistic Expression (1 day) - The participant will use a chosen form of artistic expression (e.g., painting, dancing, poetry, or music) to capture their journey and insights gained during the rite of passage. This expression will serve as a permanent reminder of their spiritual transformation.

3. Community Integration (1 day) - The individual will return to their community to share their experiences and wisdom with loved ones and fellow seekers. The community will celebrate their transformation and support the integration of their new-found knowledge into their daily life.

**Timeline**: The entire process will take approximately 17 days to complete.

**Significance**:

1. Personal Growth - This modern rite of passage is designed to encourage individuals to look inward, face their fears, and gain insights into their inner self.

2. Inner Transformation - The experience will push the individual to overcome physical and mental challenges, leading to a deep inner transformation and a sense of renewal and rejuvenation.

3. Harmony With Environment - The journey through nature aims to create a sense of connection and harmony with the environment and promote an appreciation for the natural world. The incorporation of technology will serve as a reminder that, when used mindfully, it can also enhance and deepen our spiritual experiences.
