In order to respond to the knowledge challenge concerning Robert Cochrane's influences, beliefs, and practices within the Witchcraft and the Clan of Tubal Cain, we need to deconstruct the question into three main areas of discussion: (1) Cochrane's influences and beliefs, (2) the practices of the Clan of Tubal Cain, and (3) the intersection of these with historical, mythological, and esoteric frameworks, leading to a transformative perspective on modern witchcraft.

1. **Cochrane's influences and beliefs**:

Robert Cochrane (1931-1966), born Roy Bowers, was a prominent figure of British Traditional Witchcraft and the founder of the Clan of Tubal Cain, a mystery tradition with roots within the loosely termed 'witchcraft revival' of the 20th century. He was influenced by his claimed family heritage of Cunning Folk and historical Craft figures such as George Pickingill. His beliefs were syncretic and drew from various sources, including folklore, primitive witchcraft, ceremonial magic, and the works of authors like Austin Osman Spare and Aleister Crowley.

Cochrane considered witchcraft to be a mystical path centered around direct experience and communion with the divine. He saw witchcraft as an ecstatic and transformational practice, which primarily focused on developing a relationship with the gods and the forces of nature. Key concepts in his belief system include the serpentine form of divinity, the myth of the magus as a seeker of divine knowledge, and the symbolic use of subtle energies, such as the lunar and solar currents.

2. **Practices of the Clan of Tubal Cain**:

Cochrane's Clan of Tubal Cain is an initiatory and hierarchically structured tradition. At the core of its practices is the working of ritual magick, with an emphasis on symbolism, folklorish elements, and the direct experience of altered states of consciousness. The Clan draws on a rich mythological and symbolic system woven from various strands, including folklore, religious texts, and pagan mythologies.

The primary ritual structure of the Clan involves the observance of the "Wheel of the Year," celebrating the seasonal cycles of nature through festivals such as the Sabbats, and the lunar cycle through rites known as Esbats. Additionally, workings such as the Mark of Cain rite, which seeks to empower compounds and align their purpose with the will of the witch; the Three Mothers working, which honors three aspects of divine feminine; and the Stang Rite, which seeks to open gates to the mysteries through dedication, all contribute to the transformative nature of the practice.

3. Intersection of Cochrane's beliefs and practices with historical, mythological, and esoteric frameworks:

Cochrane's witchcraft synthesizes the experiences, knowledge, and beliefs derived from historical witchcraft and occult traditions, as well as Cochrane's personal gnosis, granting it a unique and transformative perspective. When analyzing these intersections, we can see the following key themes:

a) Use of mythopoetic language: Cochrane's concept of witchcraft relies on a rich tapestry of myths and symbols, emphasizing the importance of the mythic imagination and its role in shaping one's spiritual experience.

b) Focus on ecstatic and mystical experiences: Cochrane's witchcraft leans towards the experiential rather than the dogmatic and values direct communion with the divine through means such as trance work and altered states of consciousness. This theme connects to various esoteric and ancient practices, including Dionysian rites, shamanism, and mystery cults.

c) Observance of natural cycles: The importance of understanding and participating in natural cyclical processes reverberates through various historical and mythological frameworks. Cochrane's Clan of Tubal Cain honors these cycles through practices like the Wheel of the Year and the lunar rites.

d) Syncretism: Cochrane's beliefs and practices are notable for drawing together elements from diverse sources, including historical manifestos, folklore, primitive witchcraft, and ceremonial magic, reminding us of the fluid nature of traditions and beliefs.

In conclusion, the influences, beliefs, and practices of Robert Cochrane and the Clan of Tubal Cain offer a comprehensive and transformative perspective on modern witchcraft and its connections to the ancient Craft traditions. Key themes comprise the use of mythopoetic language, focus on ecstatic experiences, observance of natural cycles, and syncretism. Through these themes' interaction with historical, mythological, and esoteric frameworks, we can recognize the unique and powerful legacy of Robert Cochrane and the Clan of Tubal Cain.
