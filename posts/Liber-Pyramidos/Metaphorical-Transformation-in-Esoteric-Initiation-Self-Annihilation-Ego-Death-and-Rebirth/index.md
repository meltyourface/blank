In order to provide a comprehensive response to this prompt, we will first explore the core principles of Hermeticism, Cabala, and Thelema, followed by an analysis of the themes of self-annihilation, ego death, and rebirth in the context of Liber Pyramidos. Lastly, we will delve into the connections between these themes and the processes of initiation and the unfolding of one's True Will.

Hermeticism is an esoteric tradition derived from the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure considered to be the amalgamation of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. The Hermetic teachings emphasize the correspondence between the macrocosm (the broader universe) and the microcosm (the individual's own being). This belief is encapsulated in the phrase "As above, so below," which outlines that the inner workings of the cosmos are reflected in the experiences of human consciousness.

Cabala, or Kabbalah, is a mystical interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures focusing on exploring the divine structure of the universe and the various stages of creation emanating from the ultimate source. It is primarily based on the concept of the sefirot, which are ten spheres or emanations that form the structure of the Tree of Life. These sefirot unfold in stages, communicating the various patterns and principles originating from the incomprehensible divine source and culminating in the tangible world.

Thelema, founded by Aleister Crowley, is a philosophical, spiritual, and mystical system that emphasizes the discovery and manifestation of one's True Will. Summed up in the phrase "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will," Thelema teaches that every individual possesses a unique inherent purpose or True Will, which, once discovered and actualized, leads to the harmonious fulfillment of life.

In the context of Liber Pyramidos, the themes of self-annihilation, ego death, and rebirth are metaphorically represented by the process of initiation and the unfolding of one's True Will. Liber Pyramidos serves as a ritual enactment of death and resurrection, where the initiate undergoes multiple stages of symbolic transformation and purification to re-emerge as a spiritually awakened individual.

Self-annihilation and ego death are represented in Liber Pyramidos through the stripping away of attachments, distractions, and limiting beliefs, which often characterize the initial stages of any initiation or spiritual awakening. These aspects symbolize the dissolution of the ego, the conditioned identity that separates the individual from their True Will. Similar concepts can be found in Hermeticismâ€™s emphasis on the macrocosm/microcosm relationship, where the purification of the self leads to the alignment of individual consciousness with the cosmic principles. Additionally, Kabbalistic principles highlight the necessity of transcending the false ego through the illumination of the sefirot, which correspond to various aspects of divine wisdom and understanding.

Rebirth, within the context of Liber Pyramidos, signifies the reintegration of the purified self with the spiritual world and the actualization of one's True Will. This theme is representative of the transformation that the initiate undergoes once they have successfully navigated the process of ego death. The rebirth is reflective of the Hermetic principle of correspondence, where the newly awakened individual is now attuned to the higher aspects of reality. Similarly, in Kabbalah, the initiate's reintegration is metaphorically represented by the elevation through the ten sefirot, reaching a state of unity with the divine source.

The process of initiation into the esoteric teachings of Liber Pyramidos, Hermeticism, Cabala, and Thelema offers a profound exploration of self-annihilation, ego death, and rebirth. By undergoing this transformative experience, the individual dissolves the barriers separating them from their True Will and becomes a more harmonious, spiritually awakened being. This journey is symbolic of the spiritual evolution of humanity as a whole, where aligning with one's higher purpose leads to greater collective harmony and progress.

In summary, the concepts of self-annihilation, ego death, and subsequent rebirth within Liber Pyramidos are metaphorically represented by the process of initiation and the unfolding of one's True Will. Drawing upon the foundational principles of Hermeticism, Cabala, and Thelema, these themes emphasize the transformative and purifying effects of spiritual awakening. By shedding the constraints of the false ego and aligning with one's True Will, the initiate becomes attuned to higher cosmic principles, ultimately experiencing a profound rebirth and reintegration with the spiritual world.
