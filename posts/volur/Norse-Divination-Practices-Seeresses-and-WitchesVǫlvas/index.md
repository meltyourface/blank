In order to address the knowledge challenge at hand, let us first understand the individual roles and characteristics of a Seeress and a Witch/Vǫlva within the context of volur. Volur is an umbrella term referring to various forms of female seeresses, wise women, and practitioners of shamanism within Norse and Germanic traditions. As you delve deeper into the mystical realm of volur, you will find that these types of figures are quite distinct from one another in various ways.

The Seeress:
A Seeress, also known as a spákona in Old Norse, is a woman who possesses the gift of second sight. She is said to have the ability to foresee and interpret future events. These individuals were highly valued in their communities for their talents as diviners, often sought after by nobles and commoners alike for their insights about the fates of individuals, battles, and overall conditions of the world. Seeresses would often perform divination via various methods, such as casting lots or engaging in an altered state of consciousness induced by ritualistic drumming, chants, or the consumption of entheogenic substances.

The Witch/Vǫlva:
A Witch or Vǫlva, on the other hand, is a wise-woman skilled in the art of seiðr, a form of sorcery and shamanism unique to Nordic traditions. The Vǫlvas practiced a wide variety of magical arts, including healing, cursing, and even tending to the souls of the recently deceased. Additionally, witches and Vǫlvas in these ancient Scandinavian societies were highly respected figures who were often called upon to bless or protect communities during times of need.

Now, let us consider how the roles of the Seeress and Witch/Vǫlva connect with the practices of divination, shamanism, and the Web of Wyrd:

**Divination**:
Both the Seeress and Witch/Vǫlva engage in divination practices as part of their spiritual discipline. While the Seeress is more directly associated with foreseeing the future and interpreting omens, the Witch/Vǫlva might also perform divination acts in addition to their extensive knowledge of seiðr. Thus, both these figures share a common connection to the art of divination.

**Shamanism**:
In terms of shamanic practices, the Witch/Vǫlva has a deeper connection as seiðr practitioners. Shamanism in Norse tradition involves communicating with the spirits of nature and the ancestors, as well as journeying between realms. The Witch/Vǫlva's spiritual discipline and knowledge of seiðr enable them to navigate these shamanic practices efficiently. Seeresses, although not explicitly engaged in shamanic practices, may utilize some elements of shamanism in their divination rituals.

The Web of Wyrd:
The Web of Wyrd, or the tapestry of fate, is a central concept in Norse cosmology that connects all beings and events in a vast, interwoven network. Both the Seeress and the Witch/Vǫlva are deeply connected to this web; the Seeress through her prophetic visions and the Witch/Vǫlva through her ability to manipulate the strands of fate using the power of seiðr.

Now, let us discuss how perceptions of the Seeress and Witch/Vǫlva may differ amongst realms of Norse cosmology. It is essential to remember that Nordic societies were stratified, with various tribes and regions possessing their particular systems of belief. As such, the specifics of how these two figures were perceived might differ slightly from place to place.

In general, though, the Seeress might be seen as a more "honorable" figure because of her divinatory skills, piquing the interest of kings and nobles. The Witch/Vǫlva holds a more mysterious quality, respected but perhaps slightly feared due to her magical arts. The distinction between these two roles might also have been influenced by mythological gender roles of the time; while both roles are female-dominated, the Seeress's position could be viewed as more passive (receiving visions), whereas the Witch/Vǫlva was considered active (manipulating and altering fates through seiðr).

In conclusion, the Seeress and Witch/Vǫlva within the context of volur are deeply intertwined in their respective spiritual disciplines and yet maintain distinct identities. Both figures engage in practices of divination and connect with the Web of Wyrd. However, the Seeress primarily foresees and interprets future events, whereas the Witch/Vǫlva works with the more shamanic and sorcerous elements of seiðr magic. The cultural contexts of ancient Scandinavia contribute to the differentiation of these roles, including regional variations and the influence of mythological gender roles in shaping perceptions of these mystical women.
