In responding to this knowledge challenge, we will break down the analysis into several sections: virtues of the Virgin Mary, the growth of the lily flower, stages of spiritual development in esotericism and occultism, and how these elements intertwine within the legends and lore surrounding Our Lady's Lily.

### I. Virtues of the Virgin Mary
The Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, is highly venerated across Christianity and is associated with a multitude of virtues. Key among these virtues are purity, humility, and obedience. Purity is her most notable aspect, thanks to her Immaculate Conception, meaning that she was free from original sin. Humility is reflected in her being chosen by God to bear Jesus, as she was a humble servant of the Lord. Obedience is another significant virtue, as she submitted to the divine plan without question.

### II. The Growth of the Lily Flower
The lily flower, particularly the Madonna Lily (Lilium candidum), is a traditional symbol of purity and innocence, representing the Virgin Mary's own purity. The lily's life cycle starts with a small bulb underground that grows roots and a shoot that pierces through the soil to reach sunlight. The shoot eventually matures into a stem that generates leaves and buds, which, in turn, blossom into beautiful, white, trumpet-shaped flowers. This process of growth symbolizes transformation and renewal, which mirrors spiritual development.

### III. Stages of Spiritual Development in Esotericism and Occultism
Spiritual development involves multiple stages of inner growth and self-discovery. In many esoteric and occult traditions, the path to spiritual enlightenment consists of five main stages, which can be compared to the life stages of the lily flower:

1. Incubation: a period when an individual is just beginning to explore spiritual concepts and is guided entirely by faith.
2. Awakening: the realization of higher truths and the start of the search for a deeper understanding, similar to the lily sprout breaking through the ground and searching for light.
3. Purification: the process of refining oneself spiritually, ethically, and emotionally, similar to the maturation of the lily's stem and leaves.
4. Illumination: attaining a broad and profound understanding of spiritual realities, comparable to the lily's buds blossoming into flowers.
5. Union: achieving complete harmony and oneness with the divine, marking the culmination of the spiritual journey.

### IV. Intertwining of the Themes in the Legends and Lore of Our Lady's Lily
The legends and lore of Our Lady's Lily serve to illustrate the symbiotic relationship between these elements. The Virgin Mary, with her virtues of purity, humility, and obedience, is symbolically connected to the growth of the lily flower through its representation of transformation, renewal, and purity. The lily flower's representation of the Immaculate Conception and Mary's virtues also parallels the stages of spiritual development that individuals undergo in their journeys towards enlightenment in esoteric and occult teachings.

By using Our Lady's Lily as a metaphor for spiritual growth and development, both real and imagined literature and teachings have interwoven these themes to create intricate and fascinating narratives. This connection has inspired countless artists and authors to weave the story of the Virgin Mary and the lily flower through various forms of literary and visual art, perpetuating the symbology and its significance throughout history.

In conclusion, the symbolic connections between the virtues of the Virgin Mary, the growth of the lily flower, and the stages of spiritual development in esotericism and occultism are deeply intertwined in the legends and lore of Our Lady's Lily. The lily symbolizes the transformation, renewal, and purity associated with the Virgin Mary's virtues and the stages of spiritual development, which together create powerful and meaningful narratives that have been cherished and revered throughout history.
