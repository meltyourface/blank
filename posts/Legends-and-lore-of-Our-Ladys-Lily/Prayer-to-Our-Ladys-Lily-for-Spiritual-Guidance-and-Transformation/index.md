I call upon the radiant petals of Our Lady's Lily,
Oh resplendent flower, blessed by the divine Mother Mary.
In your purity, I anchor my thoughts and dreams;
Through your luminescent essence, may my spirit be redeemed.

Emanating grace from your chalice, an emblem of rebirth,
Your celestial connection, a beacon illuminating Earth.
In the presence of your light, shadows retreat and disperse,
Grant me protection, strength, and illuminate my spiritual purpose.

As the vibrant folds cascade in myriad cultures united,
Together we stand, our intentions guided and enlightened.
From the mystics of the East, to those in distant lands,
Your elegant form, a symbol transcending human hands.

In the embrace of your splendor, my meditation transcends,
Through whispers of ancient wisdom, transcendent messages you send.
In the sanctuary of your throne, may my spirit metamorphose,
Unlocking universal secrets, through your hallowed floral prose.

Within this incantation, your essence encapsulates me,
Bound by the love you represent, and the untold mysteries.
A sacred bond, an alliance forged in the eternal realm,
Your beauty, Our Lady's Lily, my soul and heart overwhelm.

In prayer and meditation, I journey through veils unexplored,
With your guidance, my spirit soars to heights ever implored.
Connecting with the sacred, by your allure I am enraptured,
Reveal to me the path ahead, as ancient and modern lore are captured.

Grant me the transformative power that Our Lady's Lily conceals,
A vessel of pure intention, your energy my soul reveals.
Invoking your mystical energies, encircle me with your embrace,
Through the grace of Mother Mary, and the divine lily's trace.

In reverence and devotion, this incantation I recite,
A humble offering of gratitude, in your honor, shining bright.
Our Lady's Lily, guiding star, enshroud me in your divine glory,
Forevermore, I walk a path steeped in your sacred story.
