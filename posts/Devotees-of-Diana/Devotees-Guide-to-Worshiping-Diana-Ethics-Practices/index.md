## I. Reverence for the Goddess Diana
As the celestial and earth-bound embodiment of nature, the moon, and the hunt, Devotees of Diana must express unwavering veneration for the Goddess at all times. Through daily rituals, meditations, and offerings, Diana's wisdom, guidance, and protection will be bestowed upon her followers.

**Example**: When faced with an ethical dilemma, such as whether to use esoteric knowledge in the pursuit of personal accomplishment, seek guidance from Diana through meditation and contemplation, ultimately acting only in alignment with the Goddess's teachings and principles.

### II. Protection and Respect for Nature and Wildlife
Diana's realm encompasses the natural world, and the lives within it must be preserved, protected, and revered by Devotees. Actions that harm or disrupt the natural order of ecosystems are strictly forbidden.

**Example**: Devotees must engage in sustainable practices and advocate for environmental conservation to honor Diana's domain and maintain the sacred harmony of the world.

### III. Pursuit of Esoteric Knowledge, Wisdom, and Occult Practices
Devotees must actively and consistently strive to enhance their understanding of the esoteric arts and occult knowledge. Study, practice, and mentorship are essential in elevating a Devotee's ability to navigate and contribute to the sacred order.

**Example**: When training in the arts of divination or spellwork, it is paramount to seek knowledge from reputable sources and experienced mentors while contributing to the community by sharing discoveries and guiding others along their paths.

### IV. Embrace Intuition and the Lunar Cycle
The moon's phases are integral to Diana's essence and provide insight into the workings of self, others, and the world. Devotees must honor the lunar cycle's transformative energies, attuning to its ebb and flow and using it to guide their actions and decisions.

**Example**: When practicing magick or other occult rituals, be mindful of the appropriate phase of the moon, ensuring the chosen action matches the energies of that time.

### V. Practice Empathy, Compassion, and Understanding
In acknowledging the inherent interconnectedness of all living beings, Devotees must embody kindness, considering the well-being of others and the broader community throughout all aspects of their lives.

**Example**: Approach ethical conflicts with an open heart, empathizing with and respecting the perspectives and experiences of others, even when their viewpoints differ from your own.

### VI. Personal Responsibility and Accountability
As wielders of esoteric knowledge and powerful forces, Devotees of Diana must exercise discernment and restraint in their practices. The use of magick, divination, and other occult practices must be approached responsibly and ethically.

**Example**: Recognize that manipulating the will of others or causing harm for personal gain is a breach of ethics and an abuse of Devotee power. Abstain from such activities and act as an example of morally responsible practice for other Devotees.

### VII. Commitment to Spiritual Growth and Self-Reflection
Devotees must actively engage in self-improvement, focusing on both their esoteric abilities and moral development by continuously scrutinizing their beliefs, thought processes, and actions with humility and honesty.

**Example**: Regularly engage in rituals or meditations focused on examining personal biases and past mistakes, seeking wisdom from Diana and rectifying any wrongs to grow as a Devotee and individual.

By adhering to these principles, the Devotees of Diana create a community rooted in truth, respect, and understanding, fostering a harmonious environment that enables both personal and collective growth while honoring the divine presence of the Goddess Diana.
