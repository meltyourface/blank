### II. Key Concepts

### III. Symbols

1. **The Sigil of Babalon**: A distinctive symbol often used in rituals and magickal workings related to the Babalon Apocrypha. It consists of a chalice, a symbol of receptivity and divine feminine energy, overlaid with a seven-pointed star, representing Babalon's dominion over the seven planets of classical astrology.

2. **The Chalice and the Blade**: In ritual, the chalice is used for empoweing water or wine with the essence of Babalon, while the blade symbolizes the masculine aspect of divine energy. The union of these symbols reflects the balance and interplay between masculine and feminine forces in the universe.
