3. Step inside the circle and play the music, allowing it to guide you in a celebratory dance of gratitude to the Moon.
4. Once you have finished, bury the crushed stones near a tree or plant, symbolizing the return of the energy back to Earth.

### VI. Waning Period Rituals

During the waning moon phases (waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent), the primary focus is on releasing unhealthy patterns, shedding unwanted energies, and embracing rest and rejuvenation. To achieve this, incorporate practices such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathing to promote balance and harmony within your body.

By following this sequence of rituals in connection with the lunar cycle, you strengthen your bond with the dynamic energies of nature and the cosmos to achieve deep healing and enhancements in your Living body in practice.
