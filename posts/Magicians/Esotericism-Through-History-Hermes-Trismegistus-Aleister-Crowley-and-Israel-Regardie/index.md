To thoroughly address this knowledge challenge, we must first select three notable magicians from different historical periods. Given the rich history and evolution of esoteric ideas and occult practices, we will be focusing on Hermes Trismegistus from the Egyptian-Greek Hellenistic period, Aleister Crowley from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and Israel Regardie from the 20th century. We will then compare and contrast their symbols, philosophies, and practices, before delving into their contributions to the occult tradition and the evolution of esoteric ideas.

1. **Hermes Trismegistus**:
Hermes Trismegistus is a mythical figure that represents a syncretism of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek god Hermes. He is primarily associated with the Hermetic tradition, and his teachings are summarized in the Corpus Hermeticum. Hermes Trismegistus is not a historical figure, but his ideas and writings have influenced various mystical, philosophical, and religious systems across different historical periods.

Symbols: Hermes Trismegistus is typically depicted holding a caduceus, which is a winged staff with two serpents intertwined. This serves as a symbol of peace, communication, and the unification of opposites, which are significant themes in Hermeticism.

Philosophy: The primary philosophy underlying Hermeticism is "as above, so below," which purports that everything in the cosmos is interconnected, and that the macrocosm is reflected in the microcosm. Consequently, the study of the self is seen as the pathway to understanding the universe. The Hermetic principles are interconnected and revolve around mentalism, correspondence, vibration, polarity, rhythm, causation, and gender.

Practice: Hermetic practices include meditation, ritual work, alchemical studies, and the study of sacred geometry. Hermeticism places emphasis on attaining knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, which enables practitioners to better themselves and, ultimately, the world.

2. **Aleister Crowley**:
Aleister Crowley was an English occultist, magician, and poet who founded the religious and philosophical system known as Thelema. He was an important figure in the development of Western esotericism during the early 20th century.

Symbols: Crowley created numerous symbols to represent his teachings. The most famous symbol is the unicursal hexagram, which represents the unity of the individual with the divine. Another prominent symbol is the sigil of Baphomet, a manifestation of the divine paradox: totality and duality.

Philosophy: The primary teaching in Thelema is "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law," which emphasizes the individual's right to self-determination. Thelema is built around the True Will, the inherent purpose of each individual that is in alignment with the divine plan.

Practice: Crowley's practices include ceremonial magick, yoga, and various divination methods. Thelemites engage in rituals that aim to evoke divine or spiritual entities, known as Goetia or Enochian workings. Crowley also developed a system of magick known as the A∴A∴, which represents a transformative initiatory process towards self-realization.

3. **Israel Regardie**:
Israel Regardie was an English occultist, writer, and therapist who primarily focused on the Hermetic Qabalah. He was influenced by Aleister Crowley, which led him to become one of the most important figures within the modern revival of Western occultism.

Symbols: Regardie was primarily interested in the symbolism of the Tree of Life, a central motif in Qabalistic philosophy. The Tree of Life represents the cosmic hierarchy and the archetypal patterns that underlie all manifestation.

Philosophy: Regardie emphasized the importance of a psycho-spiritual methodology within occultism. His approach combined psychoanalysis, Jungian psychology, and Eastern esoteric practices with Qabalistic symbolism, aiming to integrate the individual's consciousness with the divine.

Practice: Regardie advocated for a systematized approach to ceremonial magick, which included the use of symbols, ritual, and invocation. He was a firm believer in the importance of a consistent daily grimoire practice and integrated therapeutic techniques such as Reichian bioenergetics to establish a healthy foundation for spiritual advancement.

In summary, each of these magicians contributed to the evolution of esoteric ideas and practices. Hermes Trismegistus laid the groundwork for Hermetic philosophy, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. Aleister Crowley founded Thelema and advanced Western occultism through his intriguing and controversial life, while Israel Regardie helped revitalize the importance of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, which established an intuitive and psychologically-oriented system to navigate the spiritual journey. Together, these three figures provided insights into the ever-evolving landscape of esoteric practices, symbolisms, and philosophies that have enriched occult traditions and continue to influence the development of magical systems to this day.
