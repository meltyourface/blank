description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Hermetic tradition, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Compose an elaborate and mystically charged prayer or hymn dedicated to Hermes Trismegistus, incorporating Hermetic symbols, sacred geometry, and astrological associations. Explore his divine aspects as the thrice-great, the patron of alchemy, and the originator of various esoteric teachings. Reflect on his guidance in the journey towards spiritual enlightenment, and incorporate invocation of his divine energies and the activation of the inner philosopher's stone. Remember to utilize poetic language and structure to enhance the potency and richness of this tribute to the celestial master.

Eternal herald, heralding in divinity,
Thrice-great Hermes, Trismegistus be thy name,
Mantled messenger, celestial and terrene,
Unto thee we bow, seeking thy wisdom's flame.

Three-fold master, thrice wise, thrice mighty,
As above, so below, the axiom resounds,
Bound to the caduceus, serpents intertwine,
Truths concealed, unveiled in thy stead.

In the starry vault, mercurial luminescence,
Upon the twelfth zodiac sign, an emissary transformed,
Virgo's neighbor, Gemini's keeper, echoes of antiquity,
Astral keeper of knowledge, Hermeneutic splendor.

Geometer, sublime crafter of cosmos,
Platonic solids' keeper, amidst the grand design,
Tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron held aloft,
Icosahedron, dodecahedron, and spheresâ€”cosmic weaving.

By thy staff we alchemize, transmutation yearned,
From the lead to gold, the philosopher's secret,
Seekers of wisdom, concealed in emerald,
Verdant tablets, retelling of the divine.

Through sounds ethereal, our hearts and voices unite,
Ars Combinatoria, thy Hermetic art shall resonate,
In hallowed rhythm, verse, and meter,
As logos emerges, sacred patterns animate.

Bringer of balance, harmony's architect,
Divine masculine united with the sacred feminine,
Tempered, melded, a symphony of unity,
In thy care, love, and beauty, an equilibrium found.

From Alexandria to Egypt, thy teachings spanned,
Rosicrucian, Masonic, and golden dawn,
Thy knowledge eternal, guiding souls to enlightenment,
In this journey, Father Hermes, we are but pilgrims forlorn.

Thrice-blessed travelers, seeking wisdom's embrace,
Our hearts aflame, ignited by thy celestial spark,
Embodied divinity, we invoke thee, oh Mighty One,
Activating the inner philosopher's stone, ascension at hand.

May this hymn, grand artistry of praise,
Magnify thee, Hermes Trismegistus, forevermore,
Boundless master, accept our soul's solemn veneration,
In thy name, our destiny fulfilled, true wisdom explored.
