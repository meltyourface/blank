Prehistoric Origins (c. 10,000 - 800 BCE):
- c. **10,000 BCE**: Early evidence of shamanic rituals and animal symbolism in prehistoric Scandinavian cave paintings depict warriors clad in animal skins, this is speculated to be the first whisperings of proto-Berserkir culture.
- c. **3500-2500 BCE**: Development of animal totemic beliefs among various tribes of Scandinavia and Northern Europe; these beliefs, although widely diverse, show elements common to Berserkir culture.
- c. **800 BCE**: Runes depicting warrior figures dressing in animal skins begin appearing in various northern European sites; suggesting the connection between warriors and animal spirits becomes more established.

Emergence of Berserkir Culture (c. **800 BCE - 200 CE)**:
- c. **400 BCE**: Strong evidence of warriors wearing animal skins and engaging in altered states of consciousness using shamanic rituals. This period marks the rise of the distinct amalgam of warrior and shaman found in the Berserkir.
- c. **1st Century CE**: Reports of these revered warriors spread throughout Germanic tribes. Roman historians recount tribesmen entering trancelike states and taking on the characteristics of fierce animals.

Mature Berserkir Tradition (c. **200 - 800 CE)**:
- 2nd - 4th Century CE: Tales of individual Berserkir warriors, their skills and their contributions to Norse warfare, become increasingly widespread.
- 5th - 6th Century CE: Key aspects of Berserkir culture, such as shamanic rituals, integration of animal symbolism, and belligerent prowess, become more defined and intricately connected.
- 7th - 8th Century CE: Integration with Norse spiritual beliefs, the Berserkir warriors assume roles as iconic figures, both to be revered in sagas and feared on the battlefield.

**Viking Age**: Culmination of Berserkir Culture (c. **800 - 1066 CE)**:
- 9th Century CE: Summit of Berserkir culture, with Berserkir warriors playing pivotal roles in Viking sagas, including the Volsunga Saga, Egil's Saga, Saga of the Ynglings, and Hrolf Kraki's Saga.
- Early 10th Century CE: Accounts from Viking raids and battles indicate that Berserkir warriors occupied a fearsome role on the front lines, acting as shock troops, and engaging in acts of legendary prowess, such as the single combat known as holmgangs.
- Late 10th - Early 11th Century CE: Appearance of the word "berserker" in Old Norse literature representing these warriors and their ferocity. The term becomes synonymous with their unfaltering ability to unleash animalistic fury in battle.
- 1030 CE: King Harald Hardrada of Norway abolishes the use of Berserkir warriors in his realm, marking the beginning of the decline of the Berserkir military role.
- 1066 CE: The Battle of Stamford Bridge marks the final appearance of the Berserkir on the battlefield of Viking Age conflict. Berserkir culture and practices continue to be celebrated and passed down in sagas, legends, and theocratic arts of the Scandinavian community.
