As a master of the occult arts and specifically of the Liber Quartus de Occulta Philosophia, I will construct a meticulous codification scheme that may be used to document, sort, and categorize personal encounters, interpretations, and results derived from engaging in the rites, rituals, and metaphysical principles espoused within the esoteric tome.

The codification scheme will entail the following primary categories, subcategories, and hierarchical structure for effortless indexing, cross-referencing, and retrieval of amassed knowledge.

1. **Rites and Rituals**
   1.1 Invocation
   1.2 Evocation
   1.3 Divination
   1.4 Enchantment
   1.5 Talismanic creations
   1.6 Theurgy (Divine workings)

2. **Metaphysical Principles**
   2.1 Synchronicity
   2.2 Meditation and altered states of consciousness
   2.3 Energy manipulation
   2.4 Astrological influences
   2.5 Elemental affinities
   2.6 Hermetic principles

3. **Spiritual Advancement**
   3.1 Novice
   3.2 Adept
   3.3 Master
   3.4 Magus

4. **Manifestations and Occurrences**
   4.1 Subtle
   4.2 Moderate
   4.3 Strong
   4.4 Overwhelming

5. **Efficiency of Magical Techniques**
   5.1 Success (Intensity, Duration, and Congruence with Intentions)
   5.2 Failure (Identify causes, lessons, and improvements for future practice)

When documenting any personal encounter, this codification can be utilized as follows:

- Prefix the entry with the category number (e.g., 1.2 for Evocation).
- Record the date of the encounter.
- Provide a specific title or name for the encounter (e.g., Evocation of Spirit X).
- Detail the methodology employed, including required preparations, tools, and incantations.
- Describe the results or outcomes, noting the efficiency of the technique as per category 5.
- Reflect upon the experience, focusing on insights gained, questions raised, and areas for improvement or further study.

For example, an entry may appear as:

### 1.2 - February 20th, 2023 - Evocation of Spirit X

**Method**:
- Preparations: Cleansing, casting the circle, and invocation of spiritual protection
- Tools: Wand, ritual dagger, brass chalice, and sigil of Spirit X
- Incantation: (Provide specific wording of incantations utilized)

**Results**:
- Outcome: Success
- Intensity: Moderate
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Congruence with Intentions: High

**Reflection**:
- Insights: Improved concentration and connection to Spirit X
- Questions: Is there a more effective time or astrological alignment to evoke Spirit X?
- Improvement: Further study on gestures and vibrations associated with the incantation

The constructed codification scheme and example provided can simplify the systematic documentation, sorting, and categorization of one's engagements with the Liber Quartus de Occulta Philosophia, aiding in personal advancement and mastery of the occult arts.
