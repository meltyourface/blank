The incorporation of angelic sigils within the text.

The Ars Notoria, a text from the medieval period and included in the wider scope of the Lesser Key of Solomon, is a unique grimoire when compared to its counterparts. Its focus lies predominantly on wisdom, knowledge, and memory improvement through practicing inner contemplation and meditation on sacred prayers and symbols, as opposed to most other grimoires that encourage communication with spirits or more practical magickal works.

These sacred symbols within the Ars Notoria are known as "notae", and are often complex geometric figures that include letters and angelic sigils. These sigils are considered the signatures of the angelic beings, expressing their divine essence and acting as a channel for specific energies related to their nature. Therefore, the presence and incorporation of angelic sigils in the Ars Notoria are unique elements that set it apart from the rest as a spiritually enriching text rather than one intended for gaining power over external forces.

The use of demon summoning rituals for gaining knowledge is more associated with grimoires like the Goetia, another part of the Lesser Key of Solomon, which focuses on the invocation and summoning of demons and spirits. The Ars Notoria, however, excludes such practices.

Moreover, the exclusion of any protective circles during ritual practice is not a unique characteristic of the Ars Notoria, as protective circles are found in different forms throughout many grimoires.

Lastly, while the Ars Notoria does emphasize philosophical components, it also utilizes the power of prayers and symbols, and thus, it does not solely rely on a purely philosophical approach without any practical methods. On the other hand, texts like The Book of Abramelin focus more on the underlying ethical and philosophical aspects of magick.

In summary, the incorporation of angelic sigils within the text is the unique element found in the Ars Notoria, which sets it apart from other grimoires and emphasizes its spiritual nature and pursuit of wisdom, knowledge, and memory improvement.
