The Seven Seals in The Book of Revelation are an essential part of the biblical text's apocalyptic narrative. They represent stages in the spiritual development and transformation of human consciousness. By referencing ancient grimoires such as "Heptameron" and "Liber Juratus," as well as mystical traditions like Kabbalah and Hermeticism, we can gain a deeper understanding of the esoteric and occult symbolism behind each seal. 

1. First Seal - The White Horse
Symbolism: Conquest, spirit, or light overcoming darkness
Initiatory Stage: Awakening of spiritual consciousness
Comparison: In Hinduism, the white horse symbolizes the soul's journey through life. In Greek mythology, Pegasus represents inspiration and higher realms of thought.

2. Second Seal - The Red Horse
Symbolism: War, conflict, and struggle
Initiatory Stage: Confronting and subduing inner and outer turmoil, leading to growth and change
Comparison: Mars in Roman mythology corresponds to this stage, and red is commonly associated with the planet in various esoteric traditions.

3. Third Seal - The Black Horse
Symbolism: Famine, scarcity, and the dark night of the soul
Initiatory Stage: The process of purification through adversity
Comparison: This stage resembles the Egyptian concept of the "field of reeds," a place of transformation before arriving at the afterlife.

4. Fourth Seal - The Pale Horse
Symbolism: Death, transformation, and transcendence
Initiatory Stage: The recognition and disillusionment of worldly attachments, leading to a spiritual rebirth
Comparison: This seal corresponds to the concept of metamorphosis found in alchemical texts and the phoenix myth's theme of death and rebirth.

5. Fifth Seal - The Souls of Martyrs
Symbolism: Spiritual persecution, the testing of faith, and the endurance of suffering
Initiatory Stage: Spiritual growth through hardships and the refinement of faith
Comparison: The martyrdom archetype is found in various mythologies and religious texts, such as the trials faced by the Persian prophet Zarathustra.

6. Sixth Seal - Cosmic Disturbances
Symbolism: The upheaval of old structures and the integration of new paradigms
Initiatory Stage: The collapse and reconstruction of established beliefs and systems, leading to a holistic understanding of reality
Comparison: This stage is reminiscent of the Hindu concept of Kali-Yuga, an era of darkness and spiritual decline preceding a new cycle of creation.

7. Seventh Seal - The Silence in Heaven
Symbolism: Divine revelation, enlightenment, and cosmic unity
Initiatory Stage: The attainment of spiritual wholeness and union with the Divine
Comparison: In Buddhism, this stage is akin to achieving Nirvana - a state of total liberation from suffering and ignorance.

Creating a comprehensive and detailed chart based on the analysis of these symbols and their corresponding stages would involve visually interconnecting the various elements mentioned above. This would include the seal's pictorial representation, the symbolism, initiatory stage, and comparisons to various mythologies and traditions. One effective way of doing this would be to create a circle with each of the seven seals represented as segments, connecting them through lines that show their correlations and shared meanings.

In conclusion, the Seven Seals in The Book of Revelation are deeply intertwined with esoteric symbolism and mystical traditions. Their significance spans across various ancient texts and cultures, highlighting a shared human experience of spiritual growth. Understanding these symbols allows us to see the Divine plan and journey towards inner enlightenment that lies at the heart of ancient Mystery Schools.
