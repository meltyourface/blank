  In order to analyze the correspondences between the three primary texts - The Sworn Book of Honorius (Liber Juratus Honorii), The Lesser Key of Solomon (Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis), and The Book of Abramelin (The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage) - in the context of the three pillars of magic, i.e., manifestation, invocation, and knowledge, we must first examine each of these texts as well as the pillars individually. Then, we can proceed to discuss each text in relation to the three pillars.
  
  1. **The Texts**:
  a. **The Sworn Book of Honorius (Liber Juratus Honorii)**: Written in the 13th century, it is one of the oldest and most respected grimoires. It is a compilation of magical practices compiled by an anonymous author, believed to be Honorius the Theurgist.
  
  b. **The Lesser Key of Solomon (Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis)**: A popular grimoire from the 17th century, attributed to King Solomon. It contains a mixture of Jewish, Christian, and pagan elements and offers practical instructions on conjuring, controlling, and binding spirits.
  
  c. **The Book of Abramelin (The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage)**: Written by Abraham of Worms in the early 15th century, it is a Hebrew mystical text that describes the author's journey to Egypt to learn sacred magical arts from the mage Abramelin.
  
  2. **The Three Pillars of Magic**:
  a. **Manifestation**: The tangible result of magical practices, often involving the creation of specific desired outcomes in the physical world.
  
  b. **Invocation**: The practice of calling upon or summoning spiritual beings or forces to aid in magical rituals. Invocations may involve complex rituals and ceremonial practices.
  
  c. **Knowledge**: Deep understanding of the principles, symbols, and rituals involved in magical practices. This knowledge may be acquired through a variety of means, including study, meditation, or direct revelation from spiritual sources.
  
  With these definitions in mind, let us examine each grimoire.
  
  3. **The Sworn Book of Honorius**:
  a. Manifestation - The Sworn Book provides rituals and spells for manifesting various outcomes, including the attainment of knowledge and wisdom, the creation of magical objects, and the control over spirits.
  
  b. Invocation - A key aspect of the rituals in The Sworn Book is the invocation of (and communication with) angelic spirits. The text provides detailed instructions on how to summon and converse with these beings.
  
  c. Knowledge - The foundational purpose of The Sworn Book is the acquisition of deep knowledge and wisdom, which enable the practitioner to exercise control over spirits and the natural world.
  
  4. **The Lesser Key of Solomon**:
  a. Manifestation - This grimoire focuses on the conjuration and binding of spirits to perform specific tasks or achieve specific goals. These tasks may involve manifestations of protection, wealth, love, or power.
  
  b. Invocation - The Lesser Key is primarily concerned with the practice of invoking and commanding spirits, primarily from the ranks of demons. The text provides extensive instructions on how to evoke and constrain these entities.
  
  c. Knowledge - A significant portion of the Lesser Key is devoted to the exploration of the hierarchy of spirits (spirits, ranks, powers, and abilities) and their corresponding magical squares and seals. Acquiring this knowledge is essential for the magician to competently invoke and command these spirits.
  
  5. **The Book of Abramelin**:
  a. Manifestation - The Book of Abramelin describes a lengthy period of purification and rituals to attain the "knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel" (KCHGA), leading to the ability to manifest desired outcomes directly through divine guidance.
  
  b. Invocation - The practitioner engages in an extensive dialogue with their HGA, who serves as a source of wisdom and revelation. Additionally, the text provides instructions on invoking the twelve evil spirits and controlling them for various purposes.
  
  c. Knowledge - The goal of Abramelin's system is to achieve the KCHGA, which is synonymous with the attainment of perfect knowledge and understanding of the divine and one's true purpose in life.
  
  Upon comparison, we see that all three grimoires intertwine and exemplify the pillars of magic in their practices:
  
  - All texts provide means of manifesting desired outcomes, whether through direct actions (The Sworn Book), the commanding of spirits (The Lesser Key), or through alignment with divine will (The Book of Abramelin).
  
  - Invocation of spiritual beings is integral to all three systems, focusing on angelic beings in The Sworn Book, demonic entities in The Lesser Key, and both the HGA and evil spirits in The Book of Abramelin.
  
  - Lastly, the acquisition of deep knowledge is essential for successful operation within all three systems, whether through understanding of the celestial hierarchy, mastery of demonic seals and names, or the attainment of the KCHGA.
  
  In summary, the texts - The Sworn Book of Honorius, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and The Book of Abramelin - intertwine and exemplify the three pillars of magic (manifestation, invocation, and knowledge) in their unique ways. The Sworn Book focuses on the acquisition of deep knowledge and wisdom through communication with celestial spirits, The Lesser Key revolves around the invocation and control of demonic entities for achieving desired outcomes, and The Book of Abramelin culminates in aligning oneself with divine will for the sake of spiritual growth and fulfillment. Together, these grimoires embody a rich tapestry of magical practices and philosophies that span centuries and cultural contexts, showcasing the core tenets that underpin the Western tradition of magic.
