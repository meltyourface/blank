description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Curses, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a sophisticated binding curse that specifically targets an individual and restricts their ability to cause any form of physical, mental, or emotional harm. The curse should incorporate rare and potent ingredients such as the venom of a black mamba, crushed moonstones, and the tears of a Chameleon. Detail the precise ritual or incantation required to activate the curse, including any sacred geometrical patterns or symbolic configurations. Additionally, incorporate a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the curse can only be lifted through a unique counter-spell, known only to the original caster, and assemble a comprehensive list of ethical considerations and potential side-effects associated with deploying such a powerful and binding curse.

## The Ebon Serpent Binding

**Intent**: This curse is designed to bind a specific individual, preventing them from causing any form of physical, mental, or emotional harm. It harnesses the essence of potent ingredients and requires a meticulous ritual to be activated.

**Ingredients**:
1. Black mamba venom (1 gram) – for amplifying the power of the curse and imbuing it with a paralyzing effect.
2. Crushed moonstones (13 grams) – for channeling lunar energies and strengthening the connection with the target.
3. Tears of a Chameleon (9 drops) – for adaptability, ensuring the curse adjusts to the target's attempts to resist or bypass it.

**Ritual**:
1. The ritual is to be performed at midnight, during a waning moon, which is the symbol of completion, surrender, and letting go.
2. Mark out a circle with a 12-foot diameter and inscribe the sacred pentagram within it, surrounded by a secondary circle of ancient runes to invoke protection and power.
3. Light five black candles at the points of the pentagram, representing the elements—earth, air, fire, water, and spirit.
4. Within the center of the pentagram, place a hair, nail, or blood sample of the target to complete the symbolic link between the curse and the chosen individual.
5. In a small glass vial, add the black mamba venom and mix it with the crushed moonstones, creating a fine paste.
6. Add the nine drops of Chameleon tears to the mixture, stirring it nine times counterclockwise while chanting the incantation:

"By the venom of Ebon Serpent, your power to harm shall be entwined.
With tears of change and moons' descent, your grip of hate we bind.

Eyes of mine, guard this curse, for another's gaze cannot unbind,
Name engraved within my soul, protected secret locked behind."

7. Seal the vial with black wax and suspend it within the circle, levitating it by supernatural means.
8. Allow the candles to burn throughout the night, strengthening the curse until the first light of dawn, at which point the binding is complete.

The curse will take effect immediately, rendering the target unable to cause harm in any way.

Fail-safe mechanism:
The incantation's final lines conceal the curse from those who might seek to remove it. The counter-spell is known only to the original caster, who may unlock the binding curse upon reciting the counter-incantation:

"By my will and voice, I break the unyielding chain,
Webs that hold dissolve as dust, your freedom to regain."

Ethical considerations and side-effects:
1. A binding curse of this power is not meant to be used lightly, only in cases where the target poses a significant and ongoing threat to others.
2. When this curse is in effect, the ability to bring any harm will extend to shielding predatory insects from themselves, potentially causing their unintentional demise.
3. Prolonged use of the binding curse may result in the target becoming increasingly desperate or erratic, seeking desperate measures to restore their capacity to cause harm.
4. The caster should consider the long-lasting ramifications of altering someone's agency in such a significant way.

In conclusion, this Ebon Serpent Binding curse contains intricate components and unparalleled potency. Exercise caution and wisdom when deploying it, weighing the ethical implications and side-effects.
