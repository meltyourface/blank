Task: Design a personalized protection amulet against curses for a thirteenth-century Alchemist, incorporating three specific cursed objects as focal points for the enchantment.

Proposed Solution:

Amulet Name: The Tri-Curse Repeller

Cursed Objects:

1. The Eye of Malphas: A small, shattered ruby lens that once belonged to the demon Malphas. The lens was broken during a battle between the demon and a virtuous archangel, rendering its power diminished but still potent.

Curse-Disrupting Property: The Eye of Malphas absorbs and neutralizes malevolent energies directed at the wearer, especially those stemming from demonic sources.

2. The Silver Tongue of Lachesis: This is a fragment of a silver serpent scale, believed to be imbued with the powers of Lachesis, one of the three Moirai sisters who govern fate.

Curse-Disrupting Property: The Silver Tongue of Lachesis grants the wearer the ability to counteract curses that are verbal or have an incantational nature. It does this by disrupting the flow of words and redirecting the energy back to the source.

3. The Tear of Fomor: A small, crystalline, teardrop-shaped gem that originated from the Irish Sea. It is said to come from the Fomorians, an ancient Irish race known for their immense power and malevolence.

Curse-Disrupting Property: The Tear of Fomor acts as a shield against nature-based and elemental curses. When activated, it vibrates at a frequency that negates elemental forces directed at the wearer.

Construction Process:

1. Collect the three cursed objects: The Eye of Malphas, the Silver Tongue of Lachesis, and the Tear of Fomor.
2. Carefully encase each object in a sphere of purified beeswax, which promotes spiritual protection and seals away any lingering malicious energies.
3. Construct a pendant using silver wire and lunar-imbued obsidian, which is a powerful protective stone. Connect the three wax spheres in a triangular shape, representing the unity of mind, body, and spirit.
4. Hold a consecration ritual during a full moon, asking for the blessings of protective deities, such as Hecate, Archangel Michael, or Brigid.
5. The wearer of the amulet should keep it close to their heart, touching the skin whenever possible to maintain a strong connection to its protective energies.

Amplifying the Protective Capabilities:

1. Daily meditation and visualization: The wearer should meditate daily with the amulet, envisioning a protective barrier surrounding them, fortified by the power of the three cursed objects.
2. Use specific sigils and symbols: Inscribing the protective symbols (such as the pentacle, the eye of Horus, or the Vegv√≠sir) on the amulet or wearing them alongside the amulet will amplify its shielding capabilities.
3. Monthly enchantment rituals: The amulet wearer should perform a continuous-cycle protection ritual every month on the night of the full moon. This ritual should involve anointing the amulet with a blend of protective oils (such as frankincense, myrrh, or rosemary) and reciting a personalized incantation to fortify its power.
4. Imbue the amulet with personal energy: To foster a deep connection to the amulet, regularly infuse it with one's energy by holding it tightly and focusing one's intentions on protection and safety.

By following the construction process and adhering to the described amplification methods, the thirteenth-century Alchemist will be well-guarded against curses with the powerful Tri-Curse Repeller amulet. By heeding these steps, the Alchemist will harness the unique curse-disrupting properties of the Eye of Malphas, the Silver Tongue of Lachesis, and the Tear of Fomor to maintain the highest level of protection from harmful sorcery.
