To fully answer this knowledge challenge and provide a comprehensive analysis, I will start by providing brief overviews of the significant astrological aspects and mythological figures involved in Malefic sorcery. Next, I will discuss their interconnected symbolism and concurrent effects on the practitioner's aims and target's existent vulnerabilities. Lastly, I will summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions.

Astrological Aspects:
1. Saturn-Pluto conjunction: In astrology, a conjunction occurs when two celestial bodies, in this case, Saturn and Pluto, appear closely together in the sky, creating a powerful energy point. Saturn, known as the Lord of Karma, is associated with boundaries, limitations, and control. Pluto, the planet of transformation, excavates deeper into the souls and forces changes often related to power dynamics and secrets. When these two planets conjoin, they produce energy focused on restructuring and profound transformation.

Mythological Figures:
1. Hecate: Hecate is the ancient Greek goddess of the night, witchcraft, necromancy, and crossroads. She has a liminal nature, dwelling on the boundaries between life and death, the mortal and supernatural realms. Hecate is a powerful figure in Malefic sorcery, as practitioners often call upon her for guidance, knowledge, and power.

Interconnected Symbolism:
The Saturn-Pluto conjunction's influence aligns with the archetypal symbolism of Hecate. Both relate to the themes of profound transformation, upheaval, and the unveiling of hidden powers. When these astrological aspects are considered in conjunction, the Malefic sorcerer gains access to a wellspring of potent energies to achieve their aims and maximize the target's vulnerabilities.

Practitioner's Aims:
A practitioner of Malefic sorcery aims to use the energies provided by these astrological aspects and the powers offered by Hecate to transform, influence, and control situations to their benefit. The conjunction's transformative energy, combined with Hecate's powers of liminality and witchcraft, allows practitioners to effectively manipulate subtle energies to affect real-world change.

Concurrent Effects on the Target's Vulnerabilities:
When a Malefic sorcerer operates under the potent influence of the Saturn-Pluto conjunction and seeks assistance from Hecate, the target's vulnerabilities become clearer and more accessible. The energies emitted from the conjunction expose hidden weaknesses, while Hecate illuminates unseen paths and dimensions that may be manipulated to exploit these vulnerabilities.

Potential outcomes may include the target experiencing increased feelings of powerlessness, facing unexpected challenges, or being forced to confront unprocessed traumas and emotions. The practitioner uses the target's vulnerabilities to destabilize their sense of self and control, resulting in a greater susceptibility to the aims of the Malefic sorcerer.

In conclusion, the Saturn-Pluto conjunction and the role of Hecate in Malefic sorcery provide an excellent example of the synergy between astrology and mythology. The conjunction's restructuring and transformative energies amplify the Malefic sorcerer's intent, while Hecate offers access to liminal realms and immense powers. This combination creates an environment where the practitioner can effectively achieve their aims while maximizing the target's existent vulnerabilities.

Key Themes:
1. The Saturn-Pluto conjunction intensifies transformative and restructuring energies in Malefic sorcery work.
2. Hecate, as a mythological figure, offers liminality, power, and guidance in sorcerous practices.
3. The synergistic effects of the conjunction and Hecate provide the practitioner a powerful means to achieve their aims while exploiting the target's vulnerabilities.
