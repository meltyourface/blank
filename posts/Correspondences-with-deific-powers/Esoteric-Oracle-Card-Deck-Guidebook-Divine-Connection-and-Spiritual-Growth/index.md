Given the limitations of text-based format, I'll provide a conceptual outline for the set of intricate occult oracle cards, their design, the archetypes, elements, and cosmic energies they represent, as well as the structure of the accompanying guidebook.

Oracle Card Design:

Each of the 78 cards will be hand-drawn and detailed, incorporating rich symbolisms, meaningful color palettes, and powerful sigils. The artwork will be inspired by various esoteric and mythological traditions, seamlessly blending them into a harmonious and visually captivating composition.

Card Categories:

1. Deific Powers (22 cards): Representing major divine archetypes, these cards will depict deities from multiple pantheons, each embodying a specific aspect of divine consciousness. Examples include The Creator, The Destroyer, and The Redeemer.

2. Elemental Energies (5 cards): These cards will represent the classical elements of Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Ether (Spirit), each associated with specific deific powers and cosmic energies.

3. Astrological Forces (12 cards): Each card will represent one of the zodiac signs and their corresponding deities, showcasing the unique attributes, energies, and spiritual influences of the signs.

4. Celestial Bodies (10 cards): Depicting the Sun, Moon, and the eight traditional planets, these cards will explore their astrological significance, connections to various deities, and their influence on human consciousness.

5. Cosmic Energies (12 cards): These cards will represent powerful universal forces, such as karma, dharma, and the wheel of life. They will feature relevant symbols and associated deities to provide a deeper understanding of these forces.

6. Esoteric Concepts (17 cards): Focused on mystical and occult ideas, such as chakras, reincarnation, and sacred geometry, these cards will facilitate personal growth and spiritual development through their embodiment of divine wisdom.

The Guidebook:

The accompanying guidebook will be organized into the following sections:

1. Introduction: Offering an overview of the oracle card system, the purpose of the cards, and the goals aimed to achieve with their use.

2. Card Descriptions: Detailing each of the 78 cards, their meanings, associated deific powers, symbols, underlying themes, and suggested interpretations.

3. Invocation Techniques: Specific rituals, invocations, and practices to connect with the essence of each card, including offerings, prayers, and visualization techniques.

4. Daily Practices: Suggestions for daily meditation, affirmation, and journaling practices to deepen the bond with the deific powers and enhance spiritual growth.

5. Oracle Layouts: Several card spreads tailored for different types of manifestations and spiritual goals, like self-discovery, decision-making, healing, and relationship insights.

6. Glossary: Explaining key terms, concepts, and esoteric principles to provide a thorough understanding of the card system and the deific powers it represents.

7. Conclusion: Encouragement for the continued exploration of divinity and a reminder of the spiritual journey's unfolding nature.

This conceptual outline serves as a foundation for creating a unique and intricate set of occult oracle cards that enables a heightened connection to divine consciousness through rich symbolism, powerful sigils, and meaningful artwork. Designing and illustrating each card, as well as writing the accompanying guidebook, would require a master artist and writer with extensive knowledge in esoteric and mythological traditions.
