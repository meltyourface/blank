To perform the Primordial Energy Meditation Technique from ancient Atlantis, begin by finding a quiet space where you feel comfortable and at ease. Sit cross-legged on the ground, or in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, and keep your spine straight but relaxed. Take several deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, and allow your mind to clear of any distractions.

1. **Earth Element**:
Place both hands on the ground or floor to connect with the Earth's energy. Visualize a rich, fertile soil beneath you, and embrace the sense of stability, strength, and growth it brings. Now, focus on the ancient symbol of a square, representing Earth. As you do so, quietly chant the mantra "E-Voh-Mah" (pronounced ee-voh-mah) to deepen your connection with the Earth's energy.

2. **Air Element**:
Move on to the Air element by resting your hands on your thighs, palms facing up. Envision gentle wind swirling around you, symbolizing communication, intellect, and creativity. Focus on the ancient symbol of a circle, representing Air. Quietly recite the mantra "Ay-Noh-Rah" (pronounced ay-noh-rah) to draw upon the Air's energy.

3. **Fire Element**:
Shift your focus to the element of Fire, gently placing the tips of your thumbs and index fingers together, forming a triangle with your hands. Visualize a roaring fire engulfing you, encompassing transformation, passion, and determination. Concentrate on the ancient symbol of a triangle, representing Fire. Whisper the mantra "Ee-Sah-Ih" (pronounced ee-sah-ih) to invoke the Fire's energy.

4. **Water Element**:
Finally, complete the elemental meditation with the Water element. Place your hands cupped together, as if holding water, resting them in your lap. Envision a calming and purifying water current surrounding you, symbolizing emotions, intuition, and healing. Bring your focus to the ancient symbol of a crescent moon, representing Water. Softly chant the mantra "Oo-Nah-Luh" (pronounced oo-nah-loo) to bond with the Water's energy.

5. **Primordial Energy Amplification**:
To amplify the energy, imagine a radiant light from the universal consciousness showering down upon you, connecting you to the ancient wisdom and universal knowledge of Atlantis. Visualize the swirling energies of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water harmonizing around your body, balancing your elemental connection.

6. **Completion**:
When you feel that you have achieved a balanced state with the elemental energies and connected with the universal consciousness, gently bring your awareness back to the present moment. Slowly open your eyes and take a few deep breaths, inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.

Practice this ancient Atlantean Primordial Energy Meditation regularly to deepen your connection with the elemental forces, attune yourself to the ancient wisdom of Atlantis, and enhance your overall well-being.
