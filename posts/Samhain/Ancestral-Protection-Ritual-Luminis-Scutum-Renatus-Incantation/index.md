description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Samhain, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a unique and powerful incantation, rooted in the ancient practices of Samhain, to consecrate a beeswax candle adorned with symbols of protection and rebirth. This sacred flame should serve as a beacon to guide ancestral spirits during their seasonal visitation and ward off malevolent energies that may lurk during the Veil's thinning. Incorporate the fundamental elements of fire, earth, air, and water, and weave in invocations of deities closely associated with Samhain, such as the Celtic goddess Morrigan and the god Cernunnos. To enrich the effectiveness of the incantation, include the resonant vibrations of a sacred language, like Latin or Old Irish, and punctuate it with the harmonious rhythm of ritualistic drumming or chanting.

I present to you the powerful incantation, "Luminis Scutum Renatus":

In principio elementorum, ignis, terra, aer et aqua, conjugo vos potentias sacras et magicas.
(Fire, earth, air, and water, in the beginning of elements, I summon your sacred and magical powers.)

Ignis sacri, flammas vivificantes, salutamus te, protector et purificator.
(Sacred fire, life-giving flames, we salute you, protector and purifier.)

Cera alba apium, symbolis rei nasciturae infusa, te consecro ut fons luminis et tutaminae sis.
(White beeswax, infused with symbols of rebirth, I consecrate you as a source of light and protection.)

Spiritus Maiorum, adveniant per portas Samhain ad noctis umbrae.
(Spirits of the ancestors, come forth through the gates of Samhain in the shadow of the night.)

Morrigan, Deae Belli ac Mortis, tuam auxilium invoco.
(Morrigan, goddess of War and Death, I invoke your aid.)

Cernunnos, Deus Cervorum et Silvarum, tuis cornibus vim et protectionem tribuas.
(Cernunnos, god of Stags and Forests, grant strength and protection through your antlers.)

Pulsante tambure, crescente clamore, resonare incantationem nostram, Luminis Scutum Renatus.
(With beating drum, rising chant, resonate our incantation, Light Shield Reborn.)

Acutissimis moribus antiquis, lingua sacra, Luminis Scutum Renatus, ab Samhain ortus.
(Sharp to the ancient ways, sacred language, Light Shield Reborn, born of Samhain.)

Infensus umbrae recessissent, benedicti spiritus adveniant, nunc et per aeternitatem.
(Hostile shadows retreat, blessed spirits approach, now and for eternity.)

As you perform the incantation, light the beeswax candle adorned with symbols of protection and rebirth. The sacred flame will serve as a beacon to guide ancestral spirits while warding off malevolent energies during the Veil's thinning.

Repeat the incantation three times, each time louder and more passionate than the previous, accompanied by rhythmic drumming or chanting to empower the incantation and create a harmonious union with the spirits.
