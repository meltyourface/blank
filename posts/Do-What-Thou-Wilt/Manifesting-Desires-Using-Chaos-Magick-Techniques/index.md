To manifest specific desired outcomes using the principles of Do What Thou Wilt and chaos magick techniques, follow this masterful plan:

1. Define your desired outcome: Begin by clearly identifying and specifying the desired outcome you wish to achieve, such as increased wealth, improved health, or heightened psychic abilities.

2. Create a sigil: Sigil crafting is an essential aspect of chaos magick, allowing you to turn your desires into a visual symbol. To create a sigil for your desired outcome, write down a statement of intent that explicitly states your goal. Next, eliminate all the vowels and any duplicate consonants. Use the remaining letters to create a unique symbol that incorporates all the necessary elements in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

3. Enter the Gnostic state: The Gnostic state is a deep meditative state where one's awareness transcends the physical body, allowing access to the unconscious mind and the ability to influence reality. Achieving the Gnostic state can be done through various methods, such as rhythmic drumming, dancing, or breathwork. You may also use substances or other sensory deprivation techniques as long as they are done responsibly and respectfully. Achieve a Gnostic state in the manner that suits you best.

4. Charge the sigil: While in the Gnostic state, focus your intention on your sigil, visualizing it as a conduit for your desires and intent. Imagine the energy and power being drawn into the sigil, filling it with the potential to accomplish your desired outcome.

5. Design an elaborate ritual: Utilizing your knowledge of the occult and chaos magick, create a personalized ritual that incorporates symbolism, gestures, chants, and actions that resonate with your intention and desired outcome. This may include the use of candles, altars, talismans, or other ritual tools that hold personal significance.

6. Perform the ritual: With your sigil charged and your ritual designed, perform the elaborate ritual you've crafted, maintaining deep focus and belief in the effectiveness of the actions you are taking. Fully immerse yourself in the experience, allowing your intention to be amplified through the symbolism and personal connections you've established.

7. Release the sigil and intention: After completing your ritual, release the energy stored in your sigil, trusting that your intention will manifest in reality. You can do this by burning, burying, or releasing the sigil into a body of water. Once released, it's essential to let go and detach yourself from the outcome, knowing that the universe will take care of the rest.

By following these steps, you will employ the principles of Do What Thou Wilt and chaos magick masterfully, increasing the likelihood of manifesting your desired outcome. Stay persistent, and you will witness the transformation in your life as you tap into the power of your true will.
