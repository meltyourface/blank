## Do What Thou Wilt

Introduction

"Do What Thou Wilt" is a central principle in modern occultism and Western esotericism, profoundly influencing a diverse range of practices and beliefs. To fully comprehend and apply this concept, one must become familiar with its origins, core tenets, and practical applications in their spiritual journey. This section will provide a comprehensive overview, allowing initiates to gain deep insights and understanding from this essential concept within esoteric studies.

Origins

The phrase "Do What Thou Wilt" originates from the philosophy of Thelema, a spiritual movement founded by English mystic and occultist Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century. He received this knowledge from a revelation in 1904, when he claimed contact with a supernatural entity called Aiwass, who dictated what later became the foundational text of Thelema, The Book of the Law. Within its pages, the maxim "Do What Thou Wilt" encapsulates the Law of Thelema.

Core Tenets

"Do What Thou Wilt" represents ultimate freedom and the liberation of the individual's divine Will. It posits that each person has a unique purpose in life, known as the "True Will." This concept is distinct from the ego-driven desires and whims that are commonly mistaken for true intent. Heed the following components of the principle:

1. True Will: An individual's deepest calling represents their True Will, the driving force behind their actions and life choices. Discovering this inner purpose is a central goal in Thelema, and fulfilling it is considered paramount to one's spiritual development.

2. Sovereignty: The Law of Thelema also emphasizes the sovereignty of the individual and their complete freedom to follow their True Will without interference. Adherents must respect each individual's pursuit of their divine purpose, acknowledging that all paths are unique.

3. Balance: Though the maxim might appear to advocate unrestricted hedonism, it emphasizes finding harmony and balance in life through aligning actions, thoughts, and desires with one's True Will. By doing so, the practitioner embraces their inherent divinity, embodying the phrase "Do What Thou Wilt."

4. Love: While "Do What Thou Wilt" can be misunderstood as selfish and amoral, it is essential to remember that the Law of Thelema includes another central maxim: "Love is the Law, Love under Will." This statement implies that the highest expression of love occurs when individuals genuinely follow their True Will, as this enables authentic connections and relationships with others.

Practical Applications

The principle "Do What Thou Wilt" serves as a powerful guiding force in one's spiritual journey by:

1. Fostering Self-Discovery: Embracing this instruction encourages individuals to embark on a meaningful inner journey to discover their True Will, honoring their inherent individuality and purpose.

2. Promoting Spiritual Growth: Adhering to one's True Will requires an ongoing commitment to personal evolution, leading to self-awareness and transformation in all aspects of life.

3. Encouraging Responsibility: In fully embracing this principle, individuals take responsibility for their lives and actions, acknowledging their capacity to shape and create their destiny.

4. Empowering Magickal Work: In occult practices, "Do What Thou Wilt" empowers magickal workings by providing a clear guideline: all magick, rituals, and spells must align with the practitioner's True Will and their highest divine purpose.

Conclusion

"Do What Thou Wilt" serves as a profound and empowering principle within the occult tradition, guiding seekers on their path to self-discovery and purpose. By grasping its origins, core tenets, and practical applications, initiates can gain deep insights and understanding that will revolutionize their spiritual journey and personal evolution. Let these insights lead you further into the mysteries of the esoteric world, enriching your practice and personal growth on every level.
