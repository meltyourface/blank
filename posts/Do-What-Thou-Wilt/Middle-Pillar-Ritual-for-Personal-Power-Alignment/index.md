To complete the Middle Pillar Ritual according to the principles of "Do What Thou Wilt," I will guide you through the process step by step, emphasizing the cultivation of personal power and alignment with your True Will. We'll begin by purifying your sacred space, and then proceed to visualize each Sephirah within your body. Additional specific symbols will be incorporated to enhance the complexity of the ritual, concluding with a Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.
**Step 1**: Purification of the sacred space
Before starting the ritual, ensure your space is clean and free of distractions. Light some incense, such as frankincense or sage, and let the smoke cleanse the room. Visualize a white, purifying light engulfing your area, expelling any negativity or unwanted energy.
**Step 2**: Enter a meditative state
Stand in the center of your space, feet shoulder-width apart, and take several deep breaths. Let your mind clear of extraneous thoughts and focus on your intent for the ritual.
**Step 3**: Visualize the Sephiroth
Beginning at the top of your head, visualize the first Sephirah, Kether, as a brilliant white sphere. As you do so, intone the divine name "Eheieh" (Eh-hay-yeh).

Next, visualize a beam of white light descending from Kether to your throat, forming the second Sephirah, Daath. Intone the divine name "YHVH Elohim" (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh El-oh-heem).

Continuing down, visualize the white light extending to your solar plexus, forming the third Sephirah, Tiphareth. Intone the divine name "YHVH Eloah va-Daath" (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh El-oh-ah vah-Dah-ath).

The white light now descends to your genitals, forming the fourth Sephirah, Yesod. Intone the divine name "Shaddai El Chai" (Shah-dye El-Chai).

Finally, the light extends down to your feet, forming the fifth Sephirah, Malkuth. Intone the divine name "Adonai ha-Aretz" (Ah-doh-nye hah-Ah-retz).
**Step 4**: Enhance the ritual with specific symbols
To personalize the ritual, incorporate sigils or talismans that resonate with your spiritual path. Hold these items in your hand or place them on an altar, imbuing each with your intent and energy.
**Step 5**: Balance energies with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram
Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to conclude the Middle Pillar Ritual, ensuring the balanced flow of energy throughout your body and sacred space. To do this, draw a banishing Earth pentagram in the air and vibrate the divine names "YHVH" (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh), "Adonai" (Ah-doh-nye), "Eheieh" (Eh-hay-yeh), and "Aglah" (Ah-glah).
**Step 6**: Journal your experiences
Once the ritual is completed, take time to journal your thoughts, emotions, and any insights gained during the process. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for future reflection and growth on your spiritual journey.

Remember, the key to any ritual is the sincerity and focus of your intentions. Trust your inner guide, and let it lead you towards the realization of your True Will.
