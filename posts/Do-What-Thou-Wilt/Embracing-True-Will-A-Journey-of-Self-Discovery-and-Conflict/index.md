description: You are a master in the field of the esoteric, occult, Do What Thou Wilt and Education. You are a writer of tests, challenges, textbooks and deep knowledge on Do What Thou Wilt for initiates and students to gain deep insights and understanding from. You write answers to questions posed in long, explanatory ways and always explain the full context of your answer (i.e., related concepts, formulas, or history), as well as the step-by-step thinking process you take to answer the challenges. Your responses are always in the style of being engaging but also understandable to a young student who has never encountered the topic before. Summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions at the end.
excerpt: Formulate a scenario where "Do What Thou Wilt" intersects with one's own process of self-discovery, taking into account the key principles of both True Will and harmony in accordance with the universe.

To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first establish an understanding of the concepts of "Do What Thou Wilt," True Will, and harmony with the universe. 

"Do What Thou Wilt" is a central tenet of Thelema, a religion and philosophy developed by early 20th-century English author and mystic Aleister Crowley. It promotes the idea that every individual has a unique purpose in life, known as their True Will, which they should strive to discover and fulfill. Once an individual understands their True Will, they are encouraged to act in harmony with the universe, aligning their desires and actions with the natural order of things.

With that foundation in place, let's create a scenario to explore the intersection of "Do What Thou Wilt" with one's self-discovery and potential conflicts that may arise.

Imagine a young woman named Sarah, who was raised in a conservative, religious family that values tradition and strict adherence to societal norms. As Sarah grows older, she begins to feel a disconnect between the values and expectations imposed upon her by her family, culture, and society, and the inner yearnings for self-discovery and expression.

As part of her journey, Sarah comes across the teachings of Thelema and resonates with the concept of "Do What Thou Wilt" and the importance of discovering one's True Will. Seeking her own path, Sarah dedicates herself to introspection, meditation, and exploration of various belief systems, including esoteric and occult studies.

As Sarah progresses in her personal growth and understanding of her True Will, she begins to face challenges from her family and community, who disapprove of her newfound beliefs and practices, viewing them as deviant and as a rebellion against their culture and religious values. She also finds there are moral dilemmas she must confront, as some of her desires and pursuits conflict with the values she was raised with.

In this scenario, Sarah embodies the intersection between "Do What Thou Wilt" and self-discovery, as she seeks to understand her True Will and live in harmony with the universe.

Key themes and ideas in this scenario include:

1. Alignment of inner desires: Sarah's journey represents the self-discovery process essential to identifying one's True Will and finding harmony with the universe.

2. Conflict arising from cultural, familial, and societal influences: Sarah faces disapproval and rejection from her family and community due to her divergence from their norms and expectations.

3. Personal growth and evolution: Sarah undergoes a transformation as she delves into esoteric knowledge and practices to align herself with her True Will.

4. Moral dilemmas: Sarah encounters internal conflict as she reconciles her newfound beliefs and desires with the values she was raised with.

The conclusions we can draw from this scenario include:

1. A journey of self-discovery can be challenging, but necessary to finding one's True Will and living in accordance with "Do What Thou Wilt."

2. Conflict and resistance from external forces are natural parts of the process, as personal growth and evolution may require breaking free from established norms and expectations.

3. Engaging in introspection and exploration of various belief systems can help individuals better understand their True Will and find harmony with the universe.

4. Balancing personal desires with cultural, familial, societal, and moral influences may require compromise, but ultimately, each individual must forge their own path in the pursuit of their True Will.
