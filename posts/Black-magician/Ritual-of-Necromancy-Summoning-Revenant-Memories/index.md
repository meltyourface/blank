excerpt: > 
  Compose a guided, dark incantation to delve into the depths of previous existences, unearthing suppressed memories and harnessing malevolent energies to enhance one's arcane prowess. Incorporate ominous imagery, demonic entities, and a nefariously orchestrated cadence, whilst providing sinister specifics and malefic mantras to empower the Black magician in their endeavor to tap into these past lives for the ultimate dominion of their dark arts. Craft a densely-layered, richly-detailed ceremony that employs the use of arcane artifacts, ethereal ingredients, and obscure sigils to ensure a uniquely intricate and arduous journey into the vast abyss of one's sordid past.

## I. Preparation

Beneath the waning crescent, in the abode unlit by any mortal light, you shall begin to prepare. With cautious steps, assemble thy ritual space; consecrate it with salt drawn from the blackest shores.

Collect the following ethereal ingredients and arcane artifacts:

1. An obsidian altar, veined with crimson streaks, symbol of the antediluvian forces awakened.
2. A chalice filled to the brim with ichor, of an infernal ancient origin, untouched by mortal hands.
3. Sigils scrawled upon parchment, penned in sanguine ink, of essence, both daemonic and revenant.
4. Seven wolfsbane candles, each blessed by a distinct emissary of the malevolent entities that guard the gateways.
5. A silver dagger, its hilt adorned with hellish runes and gems of sorrow, to pierce the veil between realms.

Arrange the arcane elements as per the Pentacle of Forbidden Roots:

- The obsidian altar, at the northernmost point,
- The chalice of ichor, placed to the east, of winds which bear whispers of the past,
- The parchment of sigils, to the west, where death's reflection is eternal,
- The wolfsbane candles, arranged in a twisted hexagon around the altar,
- The silver dagger, its blade pointed south, aimed at the heart of the earth where echoes of our forbears reverberate.

### II. The Incantation

Once the ritual space is prepared, assume your position before the obsidian altar. **Speak the following malefic mantras to infuse thy words and sigils with the potent energies of the abyss**:

"By the unhallowed winds that blow and the realms unseen I call,
Hearken, spirits of the deep, thy presence now enthralls;
Memories plaguèd and interred, arise, thy mist now clears,
Permit my grasp of former lives, of yonder buried years."

"Chthonic spirits of decay, Barathrum's abysmal brood,
In your name, I summon forth the darkness and the doom;
Engulf my mind in shadow's depths, unfurl your wicked ways,
Reveal the truths both cursed and damned, entwined in each soul's maze."

"Fragments of a thousand lives, of misery and despair,
Dimly glinting in the rifts of hellish, tainted air;
By blade and blood, I bind my will with that of higher powers,
Declaring open all chasms wide where time's grim tendrils tower."

With the incantation spoken, the air will hum with the chilling resonance of your words. The scent of smoldering embers and forgotten sorrows begins to permeate the chamber.

### III. The Sacrifice

Heretofore, with the silver dagger grasped, trace the outline of the chosen sigil upon the flesh of your left forearm. Allow the sanguine ichor to flow and drip onto the parchment. Let the blood mix with the ink of the sigil – thus, the covenant is sealed.

### IV. The Call to Revenant Memories

Raise the chalice in your right hand and toast to each cardinal point, invoking once more the ancient spirits with this final verse:

"Powers of the void and entities veiled,
Lend me now your unhallowed gaze,
For replete with purpose, I descend,
Into pasts obscured, in darkness wade."

With a deep swallow, partake of the sinistrous draught, quaffing the ichor of yore. Allow the memories to fill your being, guided by the sinister specters which now surround you.

And so it is done.

The journey into your own abyss has begun. Past lives fleeting, abundant memories shall come unbidden, bestowing their dark and arcane secrets unto thee. Master the malevolent energies, forge these newfound profanities into a formidable skill; emerge the ultimate dominion of the dark arts.
