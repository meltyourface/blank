---**Step 1**: Research and understanding
Before attempting to connect with the energies of ancient Celtic animal totems, you must first develop a deep understanding of Celtic mythology, spirituality, and symbolism. Study the different Celtic animal totems and their meanings and learn the history of the Celtic people and their connections with the natural world. Familiarize yourself with necromancy and the practices associated with communing with the dead.
**Step 2**: Self-reflection and personal growth
Before engaging in any esoteric or occult practices, it is essential to establish a solid foundation of self-awareness and personal growth. Engage in regular meditation, exercise, and self-improvement to ensure you approach these practices from a position of emotional and spiritual stability. Recognize and accept your personal strengths and weaknesses and set clear intentions for your spiritual journey.
**Step 3**: Selecting the appropriate animal totem
Each Celtic animal totem carries its own unique qualities and attributes. Align your personal intentions with the specific animal that embodies the qualities you wish to enhance, such as the stag for strength, the salmon for wisdom, or the hawk for vision. Consider studying your dreams, consulting a spirit guide, or working with a mentor to help identify the most suitable totem for your needs.
**Step 4**: Creating a sacred space
Design a personal and meaningful sacred space to perform the invocation and all subsequent rituals. This space should be filled with items connected to the chosen animal totem, such as sculptures, paintings, or symbolic items, along with tools required for the necromantic rituals, like candles, incense, and herbs. Keep this space clean, organized, and free from distractions.
**Step 5**: Ritual preparation
Throughout the course of a week, begin preparing for the invocation ritual by meditating daily on your intention to connect with the chosen Celtic animal totem spirit. Inscribe a personal sigil or symbol representing the animal totem on a small wooden or clay disk, which will be used to channel the energies during the ritual. Meditate regularly and fast for a day to purify your body and spirit in preparation for the ritual.
**Step 6**: The invocation ritual

- Begin by lighting candles and incense in your sacred space, allowing the aroma to cleanse and purify the area.
- Perform a grounding and protection ritual using your preferred method, such as casting a circle or calling upon protective spirits or deities.
- Sit comfortably in front of the prepared altar, holding the inscribed disk in both hands.
- Close your eyes and take several deep breaths, focusing on the energies of the animal totem.
- Speak an invocation, such as: "Ancient spirits of the (chosen animal), I call upon you to guide me on my path of personal growth and spiritual development. Allow me to embody your wisdom, strength, and vision. I honor you and welcome your presence in my life."
- Meditate on the energies of the animal totem, opening your intuition to receive its guidance and influence.
- When your meditation is complete, thank the spirit and release it, extinguishing the candles and incense to conclude the ritual.
**Step 7**: Integration and daily life
After successfully invoking the spirit, make a conscious effort to integrate the energies and wisdom of the Celtic animal totem into your daily life. Create a talisman from the inscribed disk, carrying it with you to maintain a connection to the totem. Practice meditation, dreamwork, or other mindfulness exercises to further enhance spiritual growth and development.
**Step 8**: Ethics, risks, and considerations
Before engaging in any occult or esoteric practice, consider the potential risks and ethical considerations inherent in working with powerful energies and spirits. Always approach these practices from a position of reverence, respect, and seeking personal growth and transformation. Make sure to consult with experienced practitioners or mentors as needed to ensure your practices remain safe, grounded, and ethically sound.
