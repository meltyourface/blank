## Chapter 6: The Intersection of Celtic Animal Worship and Necromancy

The practice of Celtic animal worship and necromancy has long been viewed as two separate branches of esoteric knowledge. However, the two share numerous intersections which reveal deep insights into the ancient Celts' understanding of the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. This chapter will explore the relationship between Celtic animal worship and necromancy through key rituals, relevant deities, and the symbolism of specific animals. Furthermore, we will provide practical applications and ethical considerations for the practitioner to ensure responsible and respectful engagement with these practices.

### 6.1 Key Rituals: Honouring the Animal Kingdom and the Dead

Celtic animal worship and necromancy are inherently linked through shared rituals. These rituals serve as bridges between the living and the dead, honouring both animal and human spirits.

One such ritual is the sacrifice of an animal to request guidance from a specific deity or ancestor. This practice, known as "tairis" or "toa," was a common way for Celts to honour their gods, ancestors, and the animal kingdom. It is believed that the animal's life force, or "anams," was thought to entice the spirits to collaborate with the practitioner.

Another ritual is the creation of an animal totem, often crafted from the bones or remains of an animal used in a previous sacrifice. This totem, or "uaing," serves as a conduit for channelling the animal's spirit and its associated energies. By incorporating the animal's remains into the ritual, the practitioner establishes a tangible connection to the otherworld, creating a mutual bond between the physical realm and the spiritual plane.

### 6.2 Relevant Deities: Cernunnos, Morrigan, and Arawn

Numerous Celtic deities reflect the intricate connection between animal worship and necromancy. Among the most revered are Cernunnos, Morrigan, and Arawn.

Cernunnos, the horned god of nature and animals, oversees the life cycle's progression and transformation. As patron of hunts and the animal kingdom, this deity accentuates the delicate balance between life and death, fertility and decay.

Morrigan, the goddess of war and battle, manifests as a crow or raven, embodying the liminal space between the battlefield and the realm of spirits. Practitioners seeking to communicate with deceased warriors or extract ancestral knowledge will often invoke Morrigan as their conduit.

Arawn, the god of the underworld, holds dominion over the Annwn realm, where the spirits of the deceased reside. Arawn is responsible for the souls in the afterlife and traverses the boundaries between worlds, making him an essential figure for necromancy practitioners.

### 6.3 Symbolism of Specific Animals

In Celtic animal worship, specific animal attributes are associated with certain qualities and spiritual attributes. These symbolic connections inform the rituals and practices of both animal worship and necromancy.

The deer, often connected to Cernunnos, symbolizes gentleness, grace, and regeneration. Used in rituals involving renewal and healing, the deer acts as an emblem of reconciling life and death.

The raven or crow, sacred to Morrigan, is the harbinger of transformation and prophetic insight. This bird bridges the gap between the seen and unseen worlds, making it an indispensable ally in necromantic practices.

The wolf is associated with bravery, loyalty, and endurance. As a guardian of the threshold between life and death, the wolf becomes a vital figure in rituals involving strength and protection in spiritual undertakings.

### 6.4 Practical Applications and Ethical Considerations

While engaging with Celtic animal worship and necromancy, maintaining a responsible and respectful attitude is crucial. Ensure that any ritual involving animal sacrifice is carried out with compassion and honour, preserving the animal's dignity and acknowledging its role in the sacred rite.

Additionally, be vigilant when invoking the otherworld and interacting with the spirits of the deceased. Establish boundaries to protect your own spiritual well-being, and be aware that some spirits may harbour ill intentions or possess deceptive natures.

By understanding the complexities of Celtic animal worship and necromancy and approaching these practices with reverence, the practitioner can navigate the spiritual realm's complexities while fostering a deep, transformative connection with the natural and supernatural worlds alike.
