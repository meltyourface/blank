Selected Deity: Hecate, The Goddess of Witchcraft, Crossroads, and Ghosts.

### I. **Preparation and Set-up**:

1. **Choose a location**: This ritual should be performed outdoors at a crossroads, or a place where two paths meet, as Hecate presides over crossroads. If this is not possible, create a symbolic crossroads indoors using four candles positioned to represent the four directions.

2. **Cleanse the ritual space**: Use a bundle of dried sage or any purifying incense to cleanse the area and create a sacred space.

3. **Create an altar**: Set up an altar for Hecate with a central image or statue of the goddess, candles (preferably black or purple), a small bowl filled with honey, a plate of garlic cloves, pomegranate seeds, a chalice of red wine, and a key to represent unlocking hidden knowledge.

### II. **Invocation**:

4. Begin by standing before the altar, facing the direction of the setting sun (west). **Light the candles and recite the following invocation**:

"Hecate of the Crossroads, Mighty Goddess of the Witches,
I call upon your ancient power to manifest within this rite.
As the torchbearer who illuminates the shadows,
Guide me with your wisdom and be here tonight."

### III. **Offerings and Chants**:

5. **Place a few drops of honey in the bowl**:

"I offer this honey, sweet and pure, to please your divine essence, Hecate."

6. Take a garlic clove, crush it gently, and place it on the altar:

"With this garlic, I honor your mastery over herbal knowledge and the protection you offer."

7. **Sprinkle the pomegranate seeds around the image of Hecate**:

"These seeds represent life, death, and rebirth - your eternal cycles, Great Mother."

8. **Pour a small amount of red wine into the chalice**:

"With this sacred beverage, I honor your connection to the mysteries of blood, life, and sacrifice."

9. Pick up the key, hold it in both hands, and recite the following chant:

"By the power of the key, I unlock the gateways to your wisdom, Hecate.
Enlighten my path and guide my progress through the mysteries of your ways."

10. Meditate for a few minutes, allowing the energy of Hecate to flow through you and reveal any insights she wishes to bestow upon you.

### IV. **Dismissal and Gratitude**:

11. After spending time with the presence of Hecate, extinguish the candles to symbolize the conclusion of your meeting with her.

12. **Close the ritual with a prayer of thanks**:

"Mighty Hecate, Guardian of the Crossroads,
I am grateful for your presence and guidance within this rite.
With deep gratitude, I ask you to return to your realms,
Leaving your wisdom and protection within me.
So it is."

Clean up the ritual area, keeping the key as a symbol of Hecate's presence in your life and to remind you of the sacred connection forged during the ceremony.
