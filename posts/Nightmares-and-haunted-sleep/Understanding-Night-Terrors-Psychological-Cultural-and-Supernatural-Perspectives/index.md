To address this comprehensive knowledge challenge, it is essential to dissect the factors that contribute to the manifestation of nightmares and haunted sleep experiences, specifically through a psychological, cultural, and supernatural lens. We will then examine the manner in which the interplay between these facets influences an individual's ability to confront and overcome night terrors. 

Psychological Factors:
Nightmares and haunted sleep experiences are often attributed to underlying psychological factors. Stress, anxiety, depression, and trauma are common catalysts for such experiences. From a neuroscientific perspective, nightmares are often associated with a hyperactive amygdala during the REM sleep phase. The amygdala is responsible for processing emotions, fear, and anxiety. Consequently, the presence of strong emotions or unresolved emotional issues can stimulate nightmares.

Cultural Factors:
Cultural variables significantly impact the content and frequency of nightmares and haunted sleep experiences. Different societies entertain distinct beliefs, superstitions, and traditions surrounding sleep and dreams, thus shaping the collective unconscious. For example, in some Asian cultures, sleep paralysis is interpreted as being pinned down by a malevolent spirit. In Western cultures, on the other hand, nightmares might be attributed to unresolved emotional issues, conforming to Freudian dream analysis theories. Similarly, the type of imagery and symbolism that surfaces in nightmares is often rooted in cultural archetypes and societal experiences.

Supernatural Factors:
Supernatural factors contribute to nightmares and haunted sleep experiences by introducing elements of mysticism and paranormal phenomena. These elements can derive from religious beliefs, folklore, or personal encounters with unexplained phenomena. In some cases, people might interpret nightmares or sleep disturbances as signs of spiritual attacks or the presence of otherworldly entities. The belief in supernatural explanations can compound sleep-related fears, as such interpretations often stem from a lack of control or unpredictable external forces.

Intertwining and Differing Contributions to Overcoming Night Terrors:
Psychological, cultural, and supernatural factors intertwine in that they each provide distinct yet simultaneously overlapping frameworks for comprehending and interpreting nightmares and haunted sleep experiences. In that regard, each factor can influence an individual's perception of their sleep disturbances, and potentially contribute to both the severity and duration of distress and fear surrounding such experiences.

However, these factors differ in the manner they equip individuals with the tools and resources to confront and overcome night terrors. Psychological approaches often focus on understanding and addressing underlying emotional issues, utilizing techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis, or mindfulness practices. Cultural strategies might involve seeking guidance from shared cultural resources, employing rituals or symbolic acts to ease emotional turmoil. Lastly, supernatural theories might invoke spiritual or metaphysical remedies, such as prayer, psychic protection, or communicating with spiritual guides.

In summary, the psychological, cultural, and supernatural factors all contribute to the manifestation of nightmares and haunted sleep experiences in distinctive yet interconnected ways. They influence individuals' perceptions and responses to night terrors, with each offering a unique perspective on coping and recovering from such experiences. In understanding the particular interplay between these factors in an individual's life, tailored approaches can be developed to help confront and ultimately overcome the fear and distress associated with night terrors.
