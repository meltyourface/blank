description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Gnostic cosmological conceptions, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a contemporary reinterpretation of an ancient Gnostic hymn, focusing on the intricate dynamics of Gnostic cosmological conceptions such as the emanation of divine beings, the Demiurge, and the ultimate goal of Gnostic salvation. Incorporate relevant symbolism and metaphorical language to enrich the portrayal of spiritual realms and reflect on the connections between these timeless spiritual concepts and the struggles of modern-day seekers of gnosis.

(Verse 1)
In the boundless, timeless depths, the fathomless divine,
The Pleroma's foaming ocean, where infinitude shines;
A cosmic dance of aeons, worlds unfurling in their wake,
Emanating sacred fragments, galaxies they populate.

(Chorus 1)
In the heart of silent darkness, mystic whispers fall,
Awakening the truth within us, the Gnostic fire's call;
A legacy of ancient wisdom, the Demiurge opposed,
The scent of gnostic salvation, in every petal of a rose.

(Verse 2)
Tangled in cosmic illusions, we spiral through the night,
A sea of longing souls drifting, with glimpses of eternal light;
The Demiurge's invisible hand, an architect of shadows,
Constructing a false reality, where mortal sorrow follows.

(Chorus 2)
Still, in the celestial corners, we venture far and wide,
Seeking solace in cryptic knowledge, entwining fate to guide;
Through star-strewn paths of mastery, to find Sophia's grace,
An answer to ageless questions, divine reflections trace.

(Bridge)
Eyes to the skies, where mysteries enshroud the ether,
Earthly bounds dissolved, fearless truth ascends, a phoenix feather;
The Gnostic's quest unyielding, revelations unfold,
A myriad of mystic scriptures, ancient stories retold.

(Verse 3)
In raptured, lucid moments, a cosmic truth so clear,
We illuminate clandestine visions, the fog of fear we sear;
Unraveling Aphrodite's tapestry, we glimpse divine embrace,
Transcendent grace in every cradle, a sacred pathway we trace.

(Final Chorus)
Boundless, eternal, the ocean's endless mirror;
Much like the Pleroma, our unity growing clearer;
Salvation in our grasp, we rise above the strife,
Emanating divine love and truth, triumphant in eternal life.
