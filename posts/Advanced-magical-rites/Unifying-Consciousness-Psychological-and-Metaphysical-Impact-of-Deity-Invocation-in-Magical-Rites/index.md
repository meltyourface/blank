In order to do justice to the knowledge challenge at hand, it is essential to have a foundational understanding of the key concepts involved. To put it briefly, we are dealing with the process of invoking a deity within the context of advanced magical practices like Crowley's Liber Samekh, and examining how this process influences the practitioner psychologically and metaphysically. Furthermore, we will explore these implications within the framework of interconnected occult systems. 

First, let us briefly establish the background of the system in question. Liber Samekh, also known as "The Bornless Ritual," was written by Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), an influential English occultist, mystic, and ceremonial magician. It is a key element of his magical system known as Thelema. The ultimate goal of this rite is to invoke the practitioner's personal Holy Guardian Angelâ€”a representation of one's true, divine self or higher self. This invocation is considered to be a powerful, transformative practice that can propel the individual toward spiritual and psychological growth.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the context, let us delve into the psychological implications of deity invocation in a magical rite such as Liber Samekh.

The act of invoking the Holy Guardian Angel itself can be seen as an act of unifying the conscious self (the ego) with the unconscious self (the divine or higher self). In Jungian psychology, this process is comparable to integrating the various aspects of one's psyche in an attempt to achieve individuation and psychological maturity. By engaging in such a rite, the practitioner cultivates a sense of unity not only with their own being but also with the collective unconscious. This connects the individual to the archetypal images inherent in human psychology, endowing them with an expanded understanding of human nature, myth, and symbolism. 

It is worth noting that the invocation process may also expose the practitioner to their own psychological vulnerabilities and weaknesses. As they dig deep into their unconscious mind and forge connections to the divine within, they may encounter personal fears, traumas, and anxieties. Facing these obstacles and integrating them into the conscious self is an important part of the transformational process, as it fosters personal development and resilience. 

Moving on to the metaphysical correlations, the invocation of a deity serves to embed the practitioner firmly within the collective web of esoteric knowledge, symbolism, and tradition. The primary goal of this practice is to establish a connection to the divine realm, thereby granting one access to the wisdom, power, and perceptions of this higher plane of existence. By partaking in an advanced magical rite, the practitioner is aligning themselves with a rich and ancient tradition that holds clues to the true nature of existence. Consequently, the practitioner gains greater insight into the interconnected web of various occult systems.

In this light, it is not uncommon for practitioners to discover correlations between different schools of thought, such as Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and other esoteric teachings. These hidden links provide context for the practitioner, allowing them to view their own experiences and investigations from multiple perspectives and frameworks, and ultimately enrich their understanding of the underlying metaphysical principles that govern the universe.

In conclusion, the invocation of a deity in an advanced magical rite like Crowley's Liber Samekh is a transformative and illuminating practice that carries profound psychological and metaphysical implications. The process of unifying the conscious self with the unconscious divine can lead to psychological growth and a deeper understanding of the human condition. Furthermore, this practice situates the practitioner within a complex array of interconnected occult systems, opening up new avenues for exploration and comprehension of the greater metaphysical reality.
