In order to address this knowledge challenge, we will begin by identifying three distinct advanced magical rites from different cultural traditions. Following that, we will explore the constitutive elements and underlying correspondences of these rites, concluding with their potential synthesis into a coherent ritual that immutably enhances the practitioner's mystical and magical prowess.

**Rite 1: The Hermetic Invocation of Thoth (Egyptian)**

The Hermetic Invocation of Thoth originates from Egyptian tradition and comprises a deep connection with the deity Thoth, who is attributed to knowledge, writing, and wisdom. This rite aims to attain a state of divine knowledge, enabling the practitioner to comprehend the unseen aspects of reality.

Key elements:

1. Invocation: Calling upon the presence of Thoth, the god of wisdom.
2. Alignment: Aligning oneself with the divine attributes of Thoth.
3. Visualization: Actively imagining Thoth imparting sacred knowledge onto the practitioner.

**Rite 2: The Runework of the Norse Seidr (Norse)**

The Runework of the Norse Seidr is a practice from Norse tradition involving the use of runes, powerful symbols that embody various natural forces and energies. The purpose of this rite is to channel these forces into the practitioner, subsequently manifesting their power and capabilities.

Key elements:

1. Inscription: Drawing the appropriate runes to represent the desired qualities or outcomes.
2. Invocation: Calling upon the Norse gods and goddesses to empower the runes.
3. Activation: Meditating on the inherent energies of the runes, transferring their power to the practitioner.

**Rite 3: The Tantra of the Chakras (Hindu)**

The Tantra of the Chakras, derived from Hindu tradition, focuses on awakening and harmonizing the energy centers (chakras) within the body. The goal of this rite is to attain greater spiritual and magical capabilities by unblocking, aligning, and integrating these energy centers.

Key elements:

1. Asanas: Practicing physical postures that activate specific chakras.
2. Mantras: Chanting sacred sounds corresponding to each chakra.
3. Visualization: Focusing on the flow of energy through the chakra system.

**Synthesis: The Triadic Harmonization Ritual**

By identifying the common elements and underlying correspondences of these three rites, we can create an innovative, coherent ritual that immutably enhances the practitioner's mystical and magical prowess.

1. Invocation: Begin by invoking Thoth for divine wisdom and the Norse gods and goddesses for strength and guidance. This establishes a connection to multiple sources of divine power.
2. Visualization: Visualize Thoth's wisdom as a radiant light, infusing your being, and see the empowered runes coursing through your body. This internal imagery connects the divine and natural energies being drawn upon.
3. Integration: Conduct the asanas and chanting of the chakra ritual, aligning the chakras with the light of Thoth's wisdom and the power of the runes. This harmonizes the energies, ensuring a balanced and potent outcome.

In conclusion, by identifying the Hermetic Invocation of Thoth, the Runework of the Norse Seidr, and the Tantra of the Chakras, we were able to uncover their key elements and underlying correspondences. This allowed us to synthesize the Triadic Harmonization Ritual, an innovative and coherent practice that serves to immutably enhance the practitioner's mystical and magical prowess. The resulting ritual incorporates invocation, visualization, and integration combined with elements from Egyptian, Norse, and Hindu traditions, enabling increased comprehension, manifestation, and alignment of spiritual and magical abilities.
