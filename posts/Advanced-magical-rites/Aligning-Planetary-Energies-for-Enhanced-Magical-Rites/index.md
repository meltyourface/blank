Answering this challenge will primarily entail understanding the role of planetary energies in advanced magical rites, the relevance of incorporating these energies within rituals, and the potential effects resulting from the harmonious alignment of at least three specific planetary influences on the practitioner during the working. To establish a solid understanding, let us start by briefly discussing the context of planetary energies and their correspondences within the practice of advanced magical rites.

The concept of planetary energies and correspondences has its roots in ancient Western esoteric traditions, particularly those of Hermeticism and Astrology. The seven classical planets – Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn – were considered as significant cosmic forces that governed different aspects of the physical and spiritual realms, as well as the human psyche. Each planet was thought to have unique qualities, energies, and associations with different deities, elements, metals, colors, and other symbolic aspects.

Now, let's explore the significance of incorporating these planetary energies and correspondences into advanced magical rites:

1. Enhanced potency of magical workings: Planetary energies help focus and direct the energies present during the ritual towards specific intentions, based on their intrinsic correspondences. By constructing an energetic framework around these cosmic forces, the overall effectiveness of the ritual gets amplified, as the energies become attuned to the desired outcome.

2. Personal development and spiritual growth: Aligning oneself with planetary energies aids self-discovery and inner healing, as working with these forces helps one uncover hidden potentials and confront deeply buried fears or desires. This alignment facilitates growth and a deeper understanding of the self, while refining the practitioner's intuition and magical abilities.

3. Harmony with the universe: Working with planetary energies and correspondences creates harmony between the practitioner and the cosmos, allowing the practitioner to become more in tune with the prevailing cosmic cycle of manifestation. This alignment enhances the power of the ritual and the practitioner's ability to manifest their intentions.

Now, let's consider the harmonizing effects and transformative properties resulting from the alignment of influences from three specific planets: Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter, during an advanced magical rite:

1. Mercury: Governed by the principles of communication, intellect, and travel, the harmonious alignment of Mercury's energies can enhance the practitioner's ability to convey and receive thoughts and ideas more effectively. This, in turn, aids in improving relationships, professional negotiations, and the development of psychic faculties.

2. Venus: Ruled by the qualities of love, beauty, and pleasure, the influence of Venus can engender the growth of the practitioner's emotional intelligence, compassion, and inner harmony when harmoniously aligned. This growth may result in enhancing one's physical attractiveness, charm, and connection with others.

3. Jupiter: Representing expansion, growth, and abundance, the harmonization of Jupiter's energies can help practitioners expand their knowledge base and further their spiritual development. Consequently, this expansion may result in heightened manifestations of prosperity and wisdom.

In conclusion, incorporating planetary energies and correspondences within advanced magical rites significantly enhances the potency and effectiveness of the rituals, while also contributing to personal development and spiritual growth for the practitioner. By harmonizing the influences of at least three specific planets, such as Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter, during the working, the practitioner can experience an enhanced ability to communicate, a greater capacity for love and connection, and the expansion of knowledge and abundance. This harmonious alignment ultimately triggers transformative properties that allow the practitioner to manifest their highest intentions and tap into the true potential of the cosmos.
