The correct answer is: Adopting a Qabalistic framework, utilizing planetary correspondences and seals, and directing the intent towards achieving a higher state of consciousness, combined with vibratory invocation of divine names.

**Reasoning**:
Advanced magical rites involve the integration of various esoteric and occult concepts to produce a specific outcome. In this case, the objective is to perform a transformative spell. Among the options provided, the Qabalistic framework, which is rooted in the mystical interpretations of Jewish texts and practices, offers the most comprehensive system for enhancing spiritual growth and transformation.

The Qabalistic framework is a structured system comprised of different stages of consciousness and divine emanations, represented as the Tree of Life. This structure facilitates the practitioner's understanding of the various forces at play in the universe and how they can be manipulated to manifest change.

Planetary correspondences and their associated seals are essential components of the Qabalistic system. By invoking these correspondences and symbols, the practitioner aligns their energy with specific cosmic powers. By doing so, they can attract the desired transformational energies.

The intention of achieving a higher state of consciousness is necessary for transformative success. The Qabalistic framework promotes growth through self-discovery and the attainment of spiritual wisdom. Directing the ritual intent towards enhancing one's own awareness and understanding is crucial in fully manifesting the desired change.

Lastly, the vibratory invocation of divine names resonates with the energies of the divine emanations and connects the practitioner with their higher self. This connection allows the practitioner to tap into their innate power and focus on achieving their goal of personal transformation.

Other options, while possessing some merit individually, lack the comprehensive and integrated approach found within the Qabalistic framework. This holistic system permits the practitioner to explore the depths of their own soul and facilitates the expansion of their spiritual and mental faculties, thus making it the most suitable choice for executing a successful transformative spell.

In conclusion, the Qabalistic framework offers the structure, tools, and practices necessary for a practitioner to effectively execute a transmutative spell. Its multi-layered approach provides a map to navigate the complex world of esoteric knowledge while ultimately guiding the practitioner towards self-mastery and spiritual growth.
