To complete this task, I will provide a condensed comparison of deities with similar characteristics, domains, and symbolic representations across different pantheons, focusing on specific examples from each to illustrate the potential connections and shared origins. The full study would require significant research and analysis, but the information provided here should serve as a solid starting point.

1. **Storm Deities**:

In various mythological pantheons, storm deities often represent primal forces, wielding immense power, and are responsible for influencing the weather.

- Zeus (Greek): As the king of the Greek Olympian gods, Zeus is the god of the sky, thunder, and lightning.
- Jupiter (Roman): Equivalent to Zeus in the Roman pantheon, Jupiter is the god of the sky, thunder, and lightning. He presides over the Roman gods as their leader.
- Thor (Norse): The son of Odin and a central figure in Norse mythology, Thor wields his hammer, Mj√∂lnir, and is associated with storms, thunder, and lightning.
- Indra (Hindu): Indra is the king of the gods and the god of storms, wind, thunder, and rain. He is a prominent figure in the Rigveda, a sacred Hindu text, and wields the thunderbolt, Vajra.

**Possible connections**: 
- The portrayal of storm gods as powerful leaders or central figures across these pantheons might indicate a shared origin of a primal force or a common fear of unpredictable weather phenomena.
- Their use of a symbolic weapon, such as Zeus's lightning bolts, Thor's hammer, and Indra's thunderbolt, could signify their authority over the elements and an attempt to personify natural forces.

2. **Sun Deities**:

Across many pantheons, sun gods are revered for their life-giving and sustaining powers. They often represent warmth, light, and fertility.

- Ra (Egyptian): Ra is the ancient Egyptian sun god, associated with creation, warmth, and light. He is often portrayed with a sun disk around his head.
- Helios (Greek): Known as the god of the sun, Helios rides across the sky on a golden chariot, bringing daylight to the world.
- Apollo (Roman/Greek): Although initially a god of many domains, Apollo later becomes the sun god in the Roman pantheon, taking Helios's place.
- Surya (Hindu): The sun god Surya is revered as the life-giver, the source of warmth and light. Known as the "eye of the cosmos," he rides a chariot driven by seven horses across the sky.
- Amaterasu (Shinto): Amaterasu is the sun goddess in Japanese mythology and the ruler of the universe. She is said to have brought the sun's light and warmth to Japan.

Possible connections:
- The belief in a sun deity as a life-giver and source of warmth and light could stem from the fundamental human dependence on sunlight for survival.
- The imagery of sun deities traveling across the sky might indicate an ancient concept of a moving sun, relating to how ancient cultures perceived the sun's daily journey.

3. **Death and Underworld Deities**:

Gods and goddesses associated with death, afterlife, and the underworld are present in various pantheons. They often hold authority over the dead and ensure the passage of souls to the afterlife.

- Hades (Greek): Hades is the god of the underworld and the ruler of the dead. He is the brother of Zeus and Poseidon, and their roles were assigned through a casting of lots.
- Anubis (Egyptian): Anubis is the god of death, mummification, and the afterlife. He protects the dead and ensures that their souls receive a proper burial and journey to the afterlife.
- Osiris (Egyptian): After being murdered by his brother, Set, Osiris became the god of the afterlife, presiding over the judgment of the dead and ensuring their passage to the beyond.
- Hel (Norse): Hel is the ruler of the realm of the dead, Helheim. As the daughter of Loki, she is responsible for receiving the souls of those who do not qualify for the better afterlife in Asgard.

Possible connections:
- The presence of underworld deities across cultures might indicate a shared belief in an afterlife and the need for a divine figure to oversee it.
- The recurrence of deities associated with death and the afterlife may serve to address common human fears of death and provide assurance of continuity.

In conclusion, while these examples represent just a few of the deities with similar characteristics across various pantheons, they showcase the potential connections and shared origins spanning across different cultures. By examining the similarities and differences between these gods and goddesses, we can begin to unmask the complex relationships and hidden links between these mythological figures. To develop a truly comprehensive, multidimensional framework, an in-depth study must be pursued, accounting for regional influences, historical contexts, syncretic developments, and esoteric theories.
