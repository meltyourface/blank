In order to answer this knowledge challenge, we must first break down its components and then analyze the attributes, mythologies, and cultural impacts of the Norse, Egyptian, and Hindu Gods. We will also explore their appearances in occult practices and connections to Hermetic and Neoplatonic concepts of divinity.

First, let us examine the Norse, Egyptian, and Hindu pantheons and their respective attributes and mythologies.

Norse Gods:
The Norse pantheon is characterized by its connection to the forces of nature, warfare, and human values like honor, loyalty, and strength. Some of the key figures in this pantheon include Odin, Thor, and Freyja. The Norse creation myth revolves around the interaction of fire and ice, ultimately resulting in the creation of the cosmos, and the struggles between the Gods and the Giants. Major themes include heroism, struggle, and the cyclical nature of life, as evidenced by the apocalyptic event of Ragnarok.

Egyptian Gods:
The Egyptian pantheon, on the other hand, relates more to the concepts of life, death, and resurrection, as well as cosmic order (Ma'at), fertility, and protection. Prominent figures include Ra, Osiris, Isis, and Horus. The creation myth usually involves the primordial waters of Nun and the emergence of the first god, Atum or Ra. The cycle of the Sun and the journey of Ra's solar barque are central to this mythology. The afterlife and judgment of souls are key themes, as seen by the elaborate burials and mummification processes that ancient Egyptians practiced.

Hindu Gods:
In contrast, Hinduism features a vast and complex pantheon, with a wide range of deities accommodating different cultural and philosophical beliefs. Some of the major Gods include Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva - collectively known as the Trimurti - as well as Goddesses like Durga, Kali, and Lakshmi. The Hindu creation myth often involves the cosmic egg (Hiranyagarbha) and the primordial sound (Aum). The cycle of life, death, and reincarnation (samsara) is central to Hinduism, as are the concepts of dharma (duty), karma (actions), and moksha (release).

Comparing these pantheons, it is evident that they all share some common themes, such as a cosmic order, nature, and life-death cycles. However, the treatment of these themes varies significantly and reflects the diverse environmental, cultural, and historical contexts of each pantheon.

Now let us explore the connections between these pantheons and the occult practices of ceremonial magic, divination, and rituals.

Norse influence can be seen in the use of runes, symbols of power, and ancient oracle systems. The Norse pantheon has contributed to magic practices associated with warrior strength, such as berserker Rites, and the invocation of divine ancestors like the Norns, who govern fate.

Egyptian influence on occult practice spans different magical purposes, from healing and protection spells to love and divination, often making use of the mummification process. The Egyptian Book of the Dead and the Pyramid Texts, as well as the elaborate rituals and symbolism tied to the afterlife, have also influenced modern esoteric traditions like Ceremonial Magick and Thelema.

Hindu practices have contributed significantly to the systems of Yoga, Tantra, and the deep exploration of the various states of consciousness. The main contribution to the occult studies is the development of rituals and sound-based practices, or Mantras, which are believed to influence nature, the body, and mind. The chakra system and the understanding of energetic structures have also become integral aspects of Western mysticism and occult practices.

Finally, let's examine the connections between these pantheons and the Hermetic and Neoplatonic ideas of divinities.

Hermetic and Neoplatonic thought seeks to understand the divine through a hierarchical structure and aims to achieve unity with The One, the ultimate source of creation. While all three of the mentioned pantheons are interconnected through their pantheistic nature, they also reveal an underlying structure of divine forces governing the cosmos. They represent the manifest and unmanifest, the interplay of polarities, and the balance of cosmic forces. Hinduism, in particular, shares many similar ideas, such as the concept of Brahman, which can be likened to The One in Neoplatonic thought.

In summary, the Norse, Egyptian, and Hindu pantheons share key themes of cosmic order, nature, and life-death cycles, but their mythological aspects differ due to each culture's unique environmental, political, and historical context. Their influence on occult practices ranges from runes and berserker rites of the Norse to the rituals and ceremonies based on Egyptian mythology to the mantras and inner practices heralded by Hinduism. Finally, the link between these pantheons and Hermetic and Neoplatonic thought is evident in their hierarchical structure and pursuit of unity with the divine.
