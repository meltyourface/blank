In designing this ritual, we shall focus on the lesser-known entity from the Ars Diaboli pantheon, known as Thalasson – the harbinger of lost secrets and hidden knowledge. Thalasson is associated with the depths of the ocean, symbolizing the vast expanse of unknown and concealed information waiting to be discovered. The primary goal of invoking Thalasson through this ritual is to seek guidance in uncovering secrets, understanding mysteries, and gaining esoteric knowledge.

To begin, let's discuss the ritual elements, tools, and invocations associated with Thalasson, taking into account the entity's attributes.

1. Ritual elements: Water is the primary element for Thalasson, given its association with the depths of the ocean. The ritual should be performed near a body of water, such as a lake, river, or an ocean shore, or alternatively, a sizeable water receptacle can be utilized. An offering of salt shall be provided, paying homage to the saline nature of seawater. The ritual should ideally take place during a new moon or a full moon, when the influence of the moon is at its strongest, and its effect on ocean tides is most pronounced.

2. Tools: A chalice filled with saltwater symbolizes the ocean's depths, connecting the practitioner to Thalasson's realm. A trident or a similar three-pronged instrument represents the power of Thalasson over secrets and mysteries hidden within the ocean. Incense, preferably with scents reminiscent of the sea or coastal regions, such as seaweed or sandalwood, helps establish a sensory link with Thalasson's domain, while candles in shades of blue and green reflect the colors of the ocean.

3. Invocations: The recitation of particular phrases or mantras helps to invoke Thalasson's presence. These can be phrases associated with the ocean, the search for lost knowledge, or Thalasson's ancient titles – such as "Thalasson, lord of hidden depths and keeper of lost secrets, hear my call!" Chanting in a rhythmic pattern that mimics the ebb and flow of ocean waves helps amplify the connection to Thalasson.

By combining these ritual elements, tools, and invocations, the practitioner seeks to create a space conducive to Thalasson's presence. The body of water (whether natural or the chalice) acts as a gateway, while the salt offerings and oceanic scents reinforce the connection to Thalasson's domain. The chanting of invocations in the candlelit environment strengthens the practitioner's intent and focus, drawing forth Thalasson's power to reveal hidden knowledge.

However, working with entities from the Ars Diaboli pantheon comes with a set of ethical implications and potential consequences. It is essential to remain aware of the potential risks, such as the possibility of attracting unwanted attention from other entities or having one's judgment clouded by the allure of gaining forbidden knowledge. Additionally, one must consider the potential consequences of revealing secrets or uncovering information that may best remain hidden.

In summation, our ritual design involves invoking Thalasson, the harbinger of lost secrets and hidden knowledge from the Ars Diaboli pantheon. By utilizing appropriate ritual elements, tools, and invocations, we create an environment that facilitates the discovery of secret information. Reflecting on the ethical implications and potential consequences of this ritual is vital, as manipulation of hidden knowledge can have unforeseen ramifications.
