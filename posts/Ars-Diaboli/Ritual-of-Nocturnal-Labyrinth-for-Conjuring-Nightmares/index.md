## Ritual of the Nocturnal Labyrinth

Materials:
1. Cursed gemstones: Obsidian, Black Tourmaline, and Smoky Quartz.
2. Sinister botanicals: Belladonna, Mandrake, and Wormwood.
3. Candles: 13 black candles.
4. Circle of protection: Salt or Chalk.
5. Writing medium: Quill and ink made from charcoal dust and a drop of the participant's blood.
6. Incense: Sandalwood and Myrrh.
7. Sigil: Drawn with the quill and ink on parchment or thick paper.

Preparation:

Step 1: Prepare the space by cleaning and making it quiet and dark, blocking any source of natural or artificial light.

Step 2: During the waning moon phase, when its dark energies are pronounced, gather the 13 black candles, incense blend, sinister botanicals, and cursed gemstones.

Step 3: Center yourself and enter a meditative state, allowing your thoughts to drift towards the nightmares you wish to conjure.

Step 4: Create the Sigil of the Nocturnal Labyrinth while in this focused state, incorporating the shapes of the cursed gemstones and sinister botanicals into one cohesive design. Infuse the Sigil with your intention, visualizing your creative force pouring into it. 

Step 5: Draw a circle of protection around your ritual space with the salt or chalk. Inside the circle, place the 13 candles in a pattern that represents the nightmare, with each candle symbolizing a step deeper into the darkness. Light the candles and the incense blend.

The Ritual:

Step 1: Hold the cursed gemstones in your hands and enter the circle of protection. Stand before the Sigil of the Nocturnal Labyrinth.

Step 2: Chant the Obscure Invocation to the Dark Forces:

"Potestates Obscuras, ego te invoco,
Per oculos tenebris et noctis spiritus.
Abyssum aperit et somnia sinistra,
Per visum caecorum revelantur."

Step 3: Crush the sinister botanicals into a fine powder and rub it onto the Sigil, ensuring each line is covered. As you do so, feel the essence of the plants and the curse of the gemstones merging with the Sigil.

Step 4: Place the Sigil in the center of the circle and surround it with the cursed gemstones. Raise your hands towards the heavens and recite the Incantation of Conjuration:

"Per lucem ignis umbrarum, noctem aeternam evoco,
Visus sinistrorum somniatorum monstrorum.
Labyrinthus nocturnis venite in me,
Ego sum true portam et iter ad infinitum."

Step 5: Close your eyes and visualize your consciousness entering the Sigil, navigating the labyrinth as you become enveloped in the nightmare you have conjured. Allow yourself to surrender to the experience, gathering information and insight from the dark recesses of your mind.

Step 6: As the ritual nears its end, thank the dark forces and release their energies back into the void. Blow out each of the 13 candles, beginning with the one closest to you, signaling your ascent from the nightmare.

Step 7: Open the circle of protection and gather the sinister botanicals, cursed gemstones, and Sigil. Separately, dispose of these materials in a way that feels proper, symbolizing the conclusion of the ritual and the dissolution of its energies.

Note: As with any ritual involving dark forces and potentially dangerous materials, proceed at your own risk and use caution. Populate the ritual with specifics to satisfy your needs while ensuring to honor and respect the potential dangers that lie ahead.
