Ritual Name: Purification of the Shadow Glade

Objective: To counteract the lethal effects of a toxin derived from a necromantic plant, known for its ties to the realm of the deceased.

Botanical Ingredients and Ratios:
1. Vitae Mysterium Flower (5 petals): A rare blossom that contains rejuvenating energies to support the shedding of negative influences.
2. Phylactery Root (1 tbsp, ground): A potent binding agent that reinforces the connection between the earthly realm and the spirit realm.
3. Tears of Luna Leaves (2 leaves): These luminescent leaves attract and harness the cleansing power of the moon.
4. Solaris Marigold (3 flowers): A golden bloom that channels the purifying energy of the sun.
5. Spirit Willow Bark (1 small piece): Obtained from ancient willow trees, this bark enhances spiritual protection and communication.

Specific Incantations:
1. Begin by invoking the spirits of nature:

"Spirits of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air,
Attend to this plea, oh witness, and hear.
With humble heart and respect sincere,
Entreat your assistance, in this task, appear."

2. As you mix the ingredients together, chant:

"Vitae Mysterium, restore life's flow,
Phylactery Root, the binding force grow.
Tears of Luna, purify by night,
Solaris Marigold, cleanse with sunlight."

3. Upon completing the mixture, call forth the synergy between ingredients:

"Spirit Willow, protection grant,
Synergy and power to this life-saving plant.
Into unity, elements and spirits blend,
Collective energy, this curse we shall end."

Metaphysical Properties:
1. Vitae Mysterium: Rejuvenation, renewal of energy, purging of negative influences.
2. Phylactery Root: Binding, strengthening ties between realms, stabilization.
3. Tears of Luna: Cleansing lunar energy, emotional healing, invoking solace.
4. Solaris Marigold: Purifying solar energy, dispelling darkness, restoration of balance.
5. Spirit Willow: Spiritual protection, communication with the spirit world, equilibrium.

Synergy:
The components work together to draw strength and cleansing energies, binding them to the victim's physical and spiritual selves. The purifying powers of the sun and moon are harnessed through the Tears of Luna and Solaris Marigold, while the rejuvenating properties of the Vitae Mysterium and Spirit Willow aid the restoration of balance in both realms. The Phylactery Root ensures a strong connection between these realms and the energies exerted upon the victim.

Side Effects and Necessary Precautions:
1. Drowsiness and slight disorientation may follow the ritual, as the body and spirit readjust. Encourage the victim to rest.
2. The ritual site must be cleansed of any remaining energy after the antidote has been administered, using salt and purified water to ensure no lingering toxins.
3. The ingredients, especially the Phylactery Root and Spirit Willow Bark, must be acquired ethically and with proper respect for the natural world.
4. Ensure that the afflicted victim consents to the ritual before proceeding.

Long-term consequences:
1. There may be an increased sensitivity to the energies of both the living and non-living realms, heightening intuition.
2. The healing process may spark a renewed interest in or respect for the interconnectedness between people, the natural world, and the spirit realm.

Remember, this ritual requires a deep understanding of the relationship between components and their metaphysical properties. Practice only with utmost respect for both the living and the deceased realms, and with positive intent to help the afflicted individual.
