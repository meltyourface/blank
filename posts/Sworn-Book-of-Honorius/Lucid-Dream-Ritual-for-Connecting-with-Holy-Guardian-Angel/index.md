The Ritual of the Dreaming Ascent

Purpose: The purpose of this elaborate ritual is to establish a potent connection with one's Holy Guardian Angel within a lucid dream. 

Materials:
1. Sigil of the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA)
2. Dream journal and pen
3. White candle and lighter
4. Chalice or goblet filled with water
5. Incense and holder (preferably frankincense)
6. Ritual dagger or athame
7. A ritual robe or white garments

Preparation:
1. Familiarize yourself with basic techniques of lucid dreaming, such as reality checks, dream anchoring, and waking-induced methods.
2. Create the sigil of your Holy Guardian Angel. Meditate on the sigil daily for one week leading up to the ritual.

Ritual:

Phase 1 - Cleansing:
1. Begin the ritual by wearing your ritual robe/white garments and entering a clean, quiet, and dimly lit space.
2. Using the dagger/athame, draw a circle around you and envision a protective barrier of light surrounding you.
3. Light the candle and incense and place them in their holders.
4. Dip your fingers in the chalice of water and anoint your forehead, saying: "I cleanse my thoughts and mind to receive the knowledge and guidance of the Holy Guardian Angel."
4. Continue by anointing your throat while saying, "I cleanse my words and speech so I may clearly communicate with my Holy Guardian Angel."
5. Anoint your heart and say, "I cleanse my heart and emotions to be fully open to the love and presence of my Holy Guardian Angel."

Phase 2 - Lucid Dream Invocations:
1. Sit or lie down comfortably in the center of the circle with the sigil in your hands.
2. Recite a prayer or invocation to your Holy Guardian Angel, such as: "Oh Holy Guardian Angel, my eternal guide and protector, I humbly request your presence in the realm of dreams. Please reveal yourself to me in my lucid dreamscape and impart your divine wisdom. As above, so below."
3. Continue by asking for any guidance, support, or questions that you desire insight on.

Phase 3 - Dream Preparation:
1. Hold the sigil of your HGA in your hands and focus on it as you drift to sleep.
2. As you lay there, maintain awareness of your body and surroundings while mentally repeating the intention to meet your HGA in a lucid dream.
3. Before falling asleep, visualize yourself in a dream setting that feels sacred and inviting. Imagine meeting your HGA here and engaging in a conversation.

Phase 4 - The Lucid Dream:
1. Once lucid, summon your HGA by focusing on their sigil, calling their name, or by reciting the invocation from earlier.
2. When your HGA appears, form a strong connection by expressing gratitude, asking for guidance, and inviting them to be with you in your daily life.
3. Interact with your HGA, asking questions or seeking advice on specific issues.
4. As the dream comes to an end, thank your HGA and remember to perform a reality check before waking up.

Phase 5 - Conclusion & Integration:
1. Upon awakening, immediately write down your dream experience, noting any messages, insights, or symbols.
2. In the days and weeks that follow, meditate on your experience, focusing on the sigil and any insights received.
3. Manifest your HGA's guidance in your daily life by following their advice, enacting their wisdom, and continuing your spiritual practice.

This ritual is designed to facilitate a powerful connection with your Holy Guardian Angel, and bring their guidance into your waking life. By maintaining a regular practice of lucid dreaming and spiritual discipline, you will find this connection deepens and becomes more accessible over time.
