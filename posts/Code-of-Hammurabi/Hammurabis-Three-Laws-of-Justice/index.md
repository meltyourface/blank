Upon the banks of Euphrates' grace,
Resounds the wisdom of Hammurabi's embrace:
In ancient letters cast,
A code of laws surpassed,
Three jewels of justice I shall unmask.

I.

Should one lay claim to debtor's tome,
Heed the words engraved in stone:
Market's silver shall suffice,
No more, no less, exact the price,
For so demands Hammurabi's throne.

II.

Behold the keeper of the field,
Supplicant of land's fertile yield,
Shall ox trespass on one's furrow,
And crop inherit woe and sorrow:
Recompense thine equal share,
From neighbor's purse, restore with care,
And the balance shall remain,
In grain and weight, justly sustained.

III.

What discord lies 'tween kin and neighbor,
The bark of life, now stained with dolor,
Hearken to Hammurabi's law,
Where truth shall from darkness crawl:
An eye for an eye, a life for a life,
To still the waters of endless strife,
As Babylon's heart keeps its beat,
Let justice rise from its hallowed seat.

Thus speaks the code of yore,
Bound by the river's eternal lore,
Hammurabi's law now blends,
Commerce, property, quarrels to mend,
Binding us all to his ancient creed,
Where justice prevails, and truth leads.
