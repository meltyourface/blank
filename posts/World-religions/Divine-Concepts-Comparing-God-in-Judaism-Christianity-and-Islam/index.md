In order to analyze the conceptualization of the divine entity within Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, it is crucial to delve into their sacred texts, explore key theological differences, as well as historical influences. This comparison will provide a comprehensive understanding of divine attributes, roles in creation and human affairs, and conceptions of prayer and worship along with their impact on followers' worldviews, religious practices, and interfaith relationships.

**Judaism**:
Judaism, the earliest of the three Abrahamic religions, conceptualizes God as a singular, incorporeal, omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good being. God is considered the creator and sustainer of the universe. The sacred text of Judaism, the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), particularly the Torah, is a record of God's revelation and His covenant with the Jewish people. In Judaism, God's primary role is that of a just, merciful, and guiding force who bestows blessings and judges the actions of individuals. Prayer and worship in Judaism take various forms, including daily prayers (known as Shacharit, Mincha, and Maariv), the Sabbath, and annual holidays.

**Christianity**:
Christianity, which emerged in the 1st century CE, similarly attributes omnipotence, omniscience, and all-goodness to God. However, the concept of the divine in Christianity is grounded in the Holy Trinity, consisting of the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. The Bible, which includes the Old Testament (similar to the Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament, serves as the sacred text that establishes the divine attributes, life, and teachings of Jesus Christ as the Son of God. Christians believe that salvation and eternal life are attained through faith in Jesus Christ. Forms of prayer and worship in Christianity include Church attendance, sacraments, and personal prayers.

**Islam**:
Islam, founded in the 7th century CE by the Prophet Muhammad, holds belief in a universally powerful, all-knowing, transcendent, and merciful God (Allah). The sacred text of Islam, the Quran, is considered the verbatim word of God as revealed to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. Godâ€™s key roles in Islam involve the creation of the universe, the continuous sustenance of all living things, providing guidance to humankind, and the eventual judgment of all individuals on the Day of Resurrection. Prayer and worship in Islam are characterized by the Five Pillars of Islam, including the declaration of faith, ritual prayer (Salat) five times a day, an obligatory almsgiving (Zakat), fasting during Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj).

Impact on followers' worldviews, religious practices, and interfaith relationships:
Each religion's understanding of God shapes the followers' religious practices and worldviews. In Judaism, adherents often focus on rituals, ethical behavior, and a sense of covenantal relationship with God. Christianity emphasizes the redeeming role of Jesus Christ, resulting in a stress on personal salvation, faith, and graciousness. Islam accentuates submission to God's will, leading to an emphasis on ritualistic obedience, religious law, and community relations.

Interfaith relationships among the three religions have been varied throughout history. While connections between the three faiths can be traced back to the shared prophetic tradition and the common monotheistic belief in one God, differences in beliefs and historical circumstances have led to conflicts as well as dialogues and cooperation. It is important to foster an atmosphere of understanding, tolerance, and dialogue among these religions in order to create an environment of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence.
