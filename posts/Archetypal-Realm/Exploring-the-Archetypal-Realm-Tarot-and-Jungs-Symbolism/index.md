To thoroughly address this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the key concepts involved â€“ Tarot's Major Arcana, and Carl Jung's concept of archetypes. Following that, we will compare and contrast their symbolism, analyze how these systems interact within the Archetypal Realm, and ultimately how they unveil underlying dimensions of the human psyche.

Tarot's Major Arcana:
The Tarot is a deck of 78 cards that have been used for centuries as a divination tool. **The deck is composed of two sections**: The Major Arcana (22 cards) and the Minor Arcana (56 cards). The Major Arcana cards represent significant life events, spiritual lessons, and deep psychological archetypes. Each card is rich with symbolism, with images depicting spiritual and archetypal concepts. Some examples of the cards include The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess, and Death.

Jung's Concept of Archetypes:
Swiss psychologist Carl Jung proposed the concept of archetypes as fundamental building blocks of the human psyche. He believed that archetypes are universal symbols or themes shared by all people throughout history and manifest in myths, stories, dreams, and the unconscious. For Jung, archetypes reside in the collective unconscious, a layer of the human mind distinct from the personal unconscious or conscious mind, and serve as organizing principles for how we experience and understand reality. Examples of archetypes include the Anima/Animus, the Shadow, the Hero, and the Wise Old Man.

Symbolism Comparison:
Both Tarot's Major Arcana and Jung's concept of archetypes use symbolism as a way to convey their respective messages. The symbols within each card act as visual metaphors that represent complex ideas and concepts. In Tarot, the symbols often draw from a variety of sources, such as religious and mythological traditions, numerology, astrology, and alchemical principles.

Jung's archetypes are not limited to certain cultures or time periods; they are universal expressions present in the collective unconscious and embody fundamental human experiences that transcend cultural boundaries. Many of the Major Arcana cards closely parallel Jung's archetypal concepts. For example, The Emperor corresponds to the Father archetype, The Empress to the Mother archetype, and The Hermit to the Wise Old Man archetype. The Fool embodies the idea of the Hero embarking on a spiritual journey, while The Devil represents the Shadow, our darker and less desirable aspects.

Archetypal Realm Interactions:
The Archetypal Realm, according to Jung, is a space that extends beyond the individual and taps into shared myths, symbols, and human experiences. It is within this realm where the Tarot's Major Arcana and Jungian archetypes interact.

By expressing archetypal concepts through visual symbols and metaphors, the Tarot can be considered a symbolic language that provides insights into the human psyche. By analyzing the Major Arcana, a reader can unveil aspects of the Archetypal Realm, revealing patterns and connections in the individual's life that can lead to self-discovery and personal growth. 

Similarly, Jung's archetypes not only help us understand the commonalities between myths and stories across cultures, but also serve as a guide to exploring and integrating our own psychological depths. When a person encounters a symbol or situation that resonates with an archetype, they are tapping into the collective unconscious and accessing the wisdom and insights of the Archetypal Realm.

Unveiling Underlying Dimensions of Human Psyche:
The interaction of these symbolic systems with the Archetypal Realm serves to unveil underlying dimensions of the human psyche by revealing universal human experiences and patterns. As we engage with the Tarot's Major Arcana and Jungian archetypes, we can gain deeper insight into our unconscious desires, fears, motivations, and behaviours. By recognizing these patterns, we can better understand ourselves and others, ultimately leading to personal growth and transformation.

In conclusion, both Tarot's Major Arcana and Jung's concept of archetypes use symbolism as a tool to convey complex ideas and concepts. Through their rich symbolism, these systems interact within the Archetypal Realm, unveiling underlying dimensions of the human psyche and providing insights into our collective and individual experiences. By tapping into these archetypal concepts, we can deepen our understanding of ourselves, others, and the world around us, fostering personal growth and self-discovery. Key themes in this comparison include the universality of archetypal symbols, the importance of symbolism as a tool for self-knowledge, and the connection between individual and collective aspects of human experience.
