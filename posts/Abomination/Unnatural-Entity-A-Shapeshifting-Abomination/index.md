The answer that most accurately represents an instance of Abomination is:

- A shapeshifting creature born through the illicit union of a human and a supernatural entity, able to cause great destruction and chaos.

**Explanation**:

The term Abomination, particularly within the context of the esoteric and occult, is often used to describe beings or phenomena that defy the natural order and disrupt the balance of the universe. This can refer to any number of entities or occurrences, ranging from forbidden rituals and spells to creatures born of unnatural couplings.

In the case of the shapeshifting creature born from the union of a human and a supernatural entity, this being represents a clear violation of the natural order. It is the result of an unnatural mixing of essences, combining characteristics of both humans and supernatural beings. This hybridization results in an Abomination, a creature that possesses powers beyond the realm of natural organisms and whose existence has the potential to bring chaos and disruption to both the human and supernatural realms.

This scenario is most closely associated with the concept of Abominations because their origins and abilities are inherently unnatural and defy the commonly understood laws governing the universe. Such entities often have the power to wreak havoc on a massive scale, posing a threat to the balance and stability of the world.

In contrast, the other scenarios, while potentially unusual or extraordinary in nature, do not necessarily represent a fundamental disruption of natural order. The alchemist's potion, psychic's clairvoyance, and the scholar's unifying theory may stretch the boundaries of human knowledge or capability, but they do not necessarily undermine basic, universally accepted principles or violate the essential structure of the universe.

Throughout esoteric and occult history, Abominations have appeared in various forms and contexts, usually as a result of tampering with forces beyond human comprehension. By understanding and identifying these instances of Abomination, scholars and practitioners in this field can work to mitigate their impact and maintain cosmic balance.
