The answer is: Utilizing a forbidden ritual to unleash an ethereal parasite to possess and control innocent bystanders, forcing them to commit unspeakable acts.

Explanation:

Abomination in the context of esoteric and occult practices usually refers to acts that are deeply and inherently immoral, unethical, and against the natural order of both the mundane and spiritual realms. There are many aspects to consider when determining whether a particular act or ritual constitutes an abomination, including the intention behind the act, the methods used, and the consequences that result from it.

Option A, summoning a minor elemental spirit to gather condensation, is a fairly benign act even if its purpose seems frivolous. It does not involve any significant harm or corruption of the spiritual balance and would not be considered an abomination.

Option B, combining spiritual aspects of multiple pantheons to invoke a powerful being, may be considered unorthodox and potentially dangerous, but it depends on the intentions and the overall interaction with those pantheons' spiritual entities. If the practitioner's intention is for the greater good and they respect the entities involved, it is not considered an abomination.

Option C, utilizing a forbidden ritual to unleash an ethereal parasite, is the best example of an act of abomination generated by an esoteric ritual. The usage of forbidden rituals often involves morally and ethically repugnant actions to begin with. In this case, the intention is to possess and control innocent people, forcing them to commit unspeakable acts against their will. It inflicts not only physical and mental harm on the victims, but also disrupts the spiritual and ethical balance of all those involved. This is a clear example of an abominable act within the realm of esoteric and occult practices.

Option D, channeling the spirit of a deceased ancestor, is typically not considered an abomination as long as the intention is pure, and the method used respects the deceased spirit and the spiritual realm as a whole.

In conclusion, it is important to discern the intention, method, and consequences of esoteric and occult rituals when determining whether an act constitutes an abomination. In this case, the act of utilizing a forbidden ritual to unleash an ethereal parasite on innocent people is an example of an abominable act due to its malicious intent, immoral means, and destructive consequences.
