1. **Preparation of the Sacred Space**:
Begin by selecting a private location, either indoors or outdoors, where you can perform the ritual undisturbed. Cleanse the area using purifying substances such as sage, frankincense, or salt. Arrange the space in a circular shape, marking the four cardinal directions with candles or stones. Create an altar at the center, where you will place artifacts, symbols, and offerings associated with death and resurrection, such as skulls, hourglasses, phoenix figurines, and ouroboros symbols.

2. **Invocation of Deities/Entities**:
Call upon the psychopomps and guardians of the afterlife, such as Anubis, Hermes, or Valkyries, to guide and protect the ritual. Light incense and offer prayers or recite sacred texts to invoke their presence and ask for their assistance in communing with the departed souls.

3. **Ancestral Relics Incorporation**:
Gather and place ancestral relics and mementos on the altar, such as photographs, personal items, or ashes, to create a stronger connection with the deceased. This will help draw their spirits closer during the ritual.

4. **Ritual Performance**:
Perform a ritualistic dance around the altar, punctuating the movements with chants or mantras that invoke the qualities of death, transformation, and rebirth. Incorporate specific hand gestures (mudras) that symbolize the passage of the soul from life to death and back again.

5. **Ritual Tools**:
Hold a ceremonial dagger, pointing it skyward, to represent the act of sacrifice and surrendering to the forces of death and resurrection. Similarly, hold a chalice filled with wine or other suitable liquid to symbolize the flow of life's essence between the worlds.

6. **Awakening and Empowerment Techniques**:
Guide the participants through a series of meditative, visualization, and energy manipulation exercises to awaken their innate psychic abilities and forge a connection with the spirit world. Techniques may include breathwork, guided visualization of entering the realm of the dead, and energy work to expand and strengthen the spiritual "antennae."

7. **Offering Ceremony**:
Create offerings for the ancestors and departed souls, such as food, water, flowers, or incense, and present them on the altar. Speak words of gratitude, love, and remembrance, and then perform a consecration ritual, imbuing the offerings with spiritual energy.

8. **Complex Symbolism and Sigils**:
Draw or etch elaborate symbols and sigils related to death and rebirth on the floor of the ritual space and upon the ritual tools themselves. The symbols should represent the eternal cycle of existence and the transformational aspect of the rite.

9. **Closing the Ritual Space**:
To close the ritual space, thank the invoked deities and entities for their help, and request the departed souls to return peacefully to the afterlife. Perform a ritual to release residual energies and seal the space, such as walking the circle in reverse while extinguishing candles or visualizing a protective barrier closing around the area.

10. **Post-Ritual Analysis and Reflection**:
After completing the ritual, encourage participants to share their experiences, insights, and newly gained knowledge. Record these discussions, as well as any personal reflections, in a journal for future reference. Based on this analysis, refine and explore new avenues of death and resurrection rites to deepen the connection with ancestors and the spirit world.
