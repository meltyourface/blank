To develop an enchantment based on Liminality to attract wealth and prosperity, we will create a ritual that utilizes specific esoteric symbols, incantations, and unique components that draw upon the powers of liminal spaces. This enchantment, referred to as the Rite of Abundant Liminality, will focus on harnessing the energies of wealth and prosperity that exist between realms and throughout the universe. 

Esoteric Symbols:
1. **The Sigil of Abundance**: A combination of the infinity symbol and a stylized coin, representing the never-ending flow of wealth.
2. **The Rune of Feoh**: An ancient symbol resembling the letter "F," it represents property and wealth.
3. **The Clefs of Liminality**: Two intertwined treble clefs symbolizing the harmony of energies drawn from liminal realms.

Incantations:
Recite the following incantation thrice while focusing on the symbols:
"Through realms unseen and powers divine,
By Liminality, wealth be mine.
Drawn from the betwixt and between,
Abundance flows, a boundless stream."

Unique Components:
1. A small pouch made from silk and adorned with gold and silver threads.
2. A pinch of rare, crushed malachite stone - associated with wealth and known for its ability to attract prosperity.
3. A vial of sand collected from a beach during a solar eclipse, symbolizing moments of transition and rarity when energies are primed for influence.

Casting during Specific Phases of the Moon:
The Rite of Abundant Liminality is most potent when performed during a Waxing Gibbous Moon or during a Lunar Eclipse, symbolizing the vessel's potential for growth.

Ritual Procedure:
1. Prepare a ritual space by drawing a circle with the Clefs of Liminality in the four cardinal directions, representing the bridge between realms.
2. Place a small bowl in the center of the circle and sprinkle crushed malachite into it.
3. Add three drops of the eclipse sand to the malachite while chanting the incantation.
4. Light a green or gold candle and hold the Sigil of Abundance and Rune of Feoh over the flame, focusing on abundance and the energies of Liminality.
5. Chant the incantation three times.
6. Carefully place the heated symbols in the silk pouch, sealing it securely.
7. Bury the pouch in the ritual space to harness the transformative energies of the Earth.
8. Release the circle by invoking the Clefs of Liminality, allowing the energies to return to the liminal realms.

To activate the enchantment, carry the pouch wherever you go and meditate on the symbols and incantation weekly. The Rite of Abundant Liminality will aid you in attracting wealth and prosperity through the hidden pathways between realms, aligned with the cosmic energies controlled by Liminality.
