A liminal experience that leverages the symbolism of Tarot's Major Arcana, the phases of the Moon, and the alchemical transmutation processes, to provide a deep understanding of the Self and personal transformation, can be conceived through a series of rituals spanning over 21 nights, one for each Major Arcana card. 

Each ritual, reflective of the associated archetype of a Major Arcana card, will be synchronized with the corresponding Moon phase and linked to an alchemical process, guiding the initiate through a transformative journey of self-discovery at the threshold of change.

First Phase (Nights 1-7): Nigredo

During the initial phase of the Moon, the waxing crescent transitioning to the first quarter, the initiate undergoes the Nigredo or "blackening" phase of alchemical transmutation. This phase is characterized by introspection, self-discovery, and acknowledgment of the shadow aspects of the Self.

1. **Fool (Night 1)**: The journey begins by embracing the Fool's courageous pursuit of the unknown. This night calls for the initiate to be open to new experiences, confronting the fear of the shadows that lurk within.

6. **Hierophant (Night 6)**: Aligned with the Hierophant, the initiate embraces the wisdom of ancient traditions and spiritual practices to shed light on their innermost truths.
7. **Lovers (Night 7)**: Lastly, the initiate examines the Lovers archetype to reconcile and balance the dynamic of duality within, recognizing the harmony necessary for personal growth.

Second Phase (Nights 8-14): Albedo

During the Gibbous Moon transitioning into the Full Moon, the initiate moves through Albedo (the "whitening" phase) where they engage with the purifying aspects of spiritual and personal self-realization.

8. **Chariot (Night 8)**: As per the Chariot, the initiate learns to master their inner conflicts and emotions, harnessing self-control and unity between the conscious and subconscious mind.

11. **Wheel of Fortune (Night 11)**: The initiate learns to accept the cyclical nature of life, surrendering to the Wheel of Fortune, and embracing the ever-changing tides of fortune and fate.
12. **Justice (Night 12)**: Reckoning with the Justice archetype, the initiate accepts responsibility for their choices, seeking balance, fairness, and truth through objective and honest self-assessment.
13. **Hanged Man (Night 13)**: The initiate embodies the wisdom of the Hanged Man by letting go of the ego, embracing new perspectives, and surrendering to the beauty of selfless sacrifice.

18. **Star (Night 18)**: Following the guidance of the Star, the initiate learns to trust the journey, cultivating hope, inspiration, and the belief in divine cosmic alignment.
19. **Moon (Night 19)**: The Moon illuminates the subconscious mind, enabling the initiate to confront the dark side of their psyche, working through illusions and insecurities.
20. **Sun (Night 20)**: Invigorated by the Sun, the initiate is filled with positivity, clarity, and vital life force energy, celebrating the joy and abundance they've cultivated through self-discovery.
