In order to analyze the symbolic parallels between Persephone's descent and subsequent dual nature and the transformative journey of occult initiates, particularly within the context of embracing both light and dark aspects of the self, we must first understand the story of Persephone and its significance within the framework of ancient Greek mythology.

Persephone, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, is a central figure in the Eleusinian Mysteries - sacred rites held in ancient Greece that celebrated the dual nature of life, encompassing both darkness and light. In this context, Persephone's story serves as a metaphor for the cyclical patterns of agricultural seasons and the inevitable cycles of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth.

Persephone was abducted by Hades, the god of the underworld, and taken to his realm to be his queen. Despite her mother Demeter's efforts to retrieve her, Persephone had been tricked into eating pomegranate seeds, thus binding her to the underworld for part of the year. After significant negotiations, an agreement was reached where Persephone would spend half of the year above ground with Demeter, occupying her role as the goddess of vegetation and harvest, and the other half in the underworld with Hades, reigning as the queen of the underworld and the keeper of departed souls. This division of time reflects the seasonal changes of the earth, with the months spent in the underworld aligning with autumn and winter, and those spent above ground corresponding to spring and summer.

Within the context of occult initiation, the story of Persephone embodies the transformative process and the concept of duality, both of which are integral to occult teachings. The transformative journey is characterized by an initiatory descent into the depths of one's unconscious mind, followed by the eventual emergence into a heightened state of illumination and understanding, symbolizing the synthesis of light and dark aspects of the self.

In the initiatory process, the descent into the underworld represents the confrontation with one's subconscious mind and the often uncomfortable or darker aspects of the self. This phase requires courage and resilience, and it allows the initiate to face their inner 'demons,' revealing unexamined emotional baggage, fears, and unresolved traumas. 

Upon successfully navigating the underworld, the initiate re-emerges into the world of light, marking the completion of the transformative journey. This process of renewal signifies the integration and alignment of the conflicting aspects of light and dark within the self, achieving a state of balance and harmony. Such a transformation enables the development of a more profound understanding of the self and the nature of reality, empowering the initiate to contribute meaningfully to the world.

In summary, the story of Persephone mirrors the transformative journey undertaken by occult initiates as they navigate the duality of light and darkness within themselves. Persephone's time split between the underworld and the earthly realm reflects the need for balance and integration of these contrasting aspects of the self. By immersing themselves in the metaphorical underworld, initiates confront the dark facets of their beings to emerge as more enlightened, self-aware, and balanced individuals, embodying the essence of Persephone's journey.
