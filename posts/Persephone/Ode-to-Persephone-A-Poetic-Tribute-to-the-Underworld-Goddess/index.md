Ode to the Enigmatic Persephone

I

In realms of twilight and verdant grace,
The radiant Persephone doth dwell,
Her visage shining in divine embrace,
And tunes of harps e'er echoing her spell.

Within the chasm lies her iron throne,
All draped in robes of black, and yet alight,
Where dim and luminous she reigns alone—
The underworld's resplendent, darkened light.

II

Oh, Persephone! Enigma crowned,
In worlds of blooming flowers you roam,
The amber sun sets, shadows now abound,
And with the dusk, a journey to your home.

Ascent to daylight, spring's eternal smile,
Descent to night, where Hades doth reside,
Your dualistic march; you tread the miles,
Both realms in harmony with you to guide.

III

Oh, keeper of the mysteries arcane,
The scales which weigh the heart, the seed, the stone,
Reveal to me your wisdom and domains,
That I may hear your whispers in my bones.

From Demeter's grasp, the fateful pomegranate torn,
Inscribed in ancient lines, this tale of woe,
Now tear the veil, the secrets to be born,
Her deeper purpose, let the winds bestow.

IV

The springtime blooms upon your outstretched hand,
The verdant leaves, the budding blossoms swell,
Embrace thy touch, the life that you command,
And in your gaze, the ancient rites retell.

The spectral figures, draped in ivy vines,
Each step, a whispered hymn, a chanted prayer,
The solstice moon with wisdom's light aligns,
In sacred circles, power fills the air.

V

The somber chthonic realm, so vast yet still,
Illuminated by your presence bright,
The Stygian gloom, obey thy wielded will,
Your rule a blend of balance, strength and light.

In this domain of shadows, cold and stark,
Beneath the earth, amidst the silent maze,
Defender of the lost souls left to hark,
Compassionate Persephone, we praise.

VI

Reveal yourself, the light and dark entwined,
The living essence of a thousand suns,
In shadows cast and spring’s green tendrils find
The secrets of your dance, ’til nature’s hymn is sung.

Celestial daughter, sovereign of below,
With lipsticked smiles, your heart so fierce and sweet,
From moonlit nights to ushered springs aglow,
Your enigma doth still enchant and mystify
In every blade of grass and spectral shadow neath our feet.
