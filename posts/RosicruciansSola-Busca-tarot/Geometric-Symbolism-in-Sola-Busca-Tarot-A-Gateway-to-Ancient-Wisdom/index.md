The Rosicrucian philosophy and the Sola-Busca Tarot are intertwined through a connection to esoteric knowledge, and the use of geometric symbolism is one of the most prominent visual representations of that connection. To fully understand the intricate relationship between the two, a deep analysis of the specific patterns, shapes, and forms present in both the Major and Minor Arcana is essential.

The Rosicrucian order, originating in the early 17th century, is a secret society dedicated to the study of ancient wisdom, mysticism, and alchemy. The Sola-Busca Tarot, dating back to the late 15th century, is the oldest known complete tarot deck, containing 78 cards that consist of 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana.

Geometric symbolism in Sola-Busca Tarot:

1. **Circles**:
Circles are present throughout the Sola-Busca Tarot, representing the concept of wholeness and cycles of life in accordance with Rosicrucian philosophy. They signify the hidden perfection and divine essence in the universe. In cards like The Fool, The World, and the Aces in Minor Arcana, circles represent the eternal nature of the soul and spiritual growth.

2. **Pentagrams**:
Pentagrams appear on cards like the King and Queen of Pentacles. The five-pointed star is thought to symbolize the five elements of Earth, Air, Water, Fire, and Ether, as well as the Rosicrucian belief in the power of alchemy and its role in the pursuit of enlightenment.

3. **Hexagrams**:
Hexagrams, formed by the intersecting of two equilateral triangles, are found in cards like The Lovers and several court cards. The hexagram represents the union of opposites, an essential concept in Rosicrucian philosophy and alchemical practices. It symbolizes the synthesis of opposites, such as male and female, to create harmony and balance.

4. **Spirals**:
The spiral can be found in numerous cards, including the Ten of Swords, Eight of Cups, Ace of Pentacles, and The Wheel of Fortune. Rosicrucian teachings associate the spiral with the unfolding of consciousness and the process of manifestation and growth.

The metaphysical or esoteric meanings:

The geometric symbolism found in the Sola-Busca Tarot speaks to the metaphysical and esoteric nature of the Rosicrucian philosophy. The symbols represent the hidden wisdom and knowledge of the ages that Rosicrucians aim to understand and apply to their lives. Their inclusion in the tarot deck emphasizes the importance of esoteric understanding in achieving personal enlightenment and spiritual progress.

The influence on interpretation and divination:

The presence of these geometric symbols in the Sola-Busca Tarot adds a layer of depth to the divinatory meanings of the cards. When interpreting the cards' symbols, the reader can draw upon the ancient wisdom, esoteric knowledge, and Rosicrucian teachings to provide a comprehensive reading that takes into account both personal and universal truths.

In conclusion, the intricate relationship between the Rosicrucian philosophy and the Sola-Busca Tarot is demonstrated through the use of geometric symbolism within the Major and Minor Arcana. The symbols provide valuable insight into the deck's metaphysical and esoteric meanings, influencing the interpretation and divinatory aspects of the Sola-Busca Tarot. Through this connection, the tarot becomes an essential tool for exploring and understanding the complex teachings of the Rosicrucian order.
