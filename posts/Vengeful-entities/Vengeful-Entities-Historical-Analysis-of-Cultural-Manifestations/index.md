To provide a comprehensive response to the knowledge challenge of identifying pivotal factors contributing to the origin and manifestation of vengeful entities, we must extensively examine the underlying psychological, cultural, and mythological components. We shall achieve this by using comparative analysis of diverse manifestations of vengeful entities across three distinct historical periods or cultures. The ultimate goal is to showcase the multifaceted nature of their dynamics. 

Analyzing the Underlying Components:

1. **Psychological Component**: In many cases, the existence of vengeful entities is deeply rooted in the basic human emotion of retribution. Often emanating from a sense of injustice, unfairness, or violation of trust, these feelings fuel the concept of vengeful entities that, in turn, can be seen as metaphysical manifestations of the innate human desire for vengeance.

2. **Cultural Component**: Different societies and cultures each have unique social norms, ethics, and belief systems that can greatly influence conceptions or manifestations of vengeful entities. Within a specific culture, individuals may conceive of vengeful entities that align with their own values and practices. These entities often serve as cautionary tales or moral lessons designed to enforce social conformity.

3. **Mythological Component**: Throughout history, gods, spirits, and other supernatural beings have commonly been portrayed as vengeful in mythology. These otherworldly figures often serve as allegories for moral quandaries or natural phenomena, allowing human societies to personally connect with spiritual or metaphysical forces. In ancient myths, vengeful entities may represent the archetypal struggle between good and evil as well as the cyclical nature of life.

Comparing Diverse Manifestations of Vengeful Entities:

1. **Ancient Greece**: Between the 8th and 5th century BCE, Greek mythology frequently featured vengeful entities, such as the Furies (Erinyes) or the Gorgons. The Furies were inescapable chthonic deities tasked with punishing wrongdoers, particularly those who had violated familial bonds (e.g., Orestes in "The Oresteia" by Aeschylus). Similarly, the Gorgon sisters, including Medusa, personified terror and vengeance, serving as embodiments of chaos and disorder. They highlighted the Athenians' fundamental understanding that these vengeful entities sought retribution and restoration of balance within society.

2. **Medieval Europe**: Between the 5th and 15th century CE, European folklore adopted various vengeful entities, the most notable being witches and revenants. Witches represented fears of heresy, apostasy, and the subversion of Christian societal norms. They often faced severe punishment, including execution, as a reflection of the collective fear of the supernatural. Revenants or "living dead" rose from their graves to avenge their untimely death or to settle unfinished business. The presence of these vengeful entities was a testament to the Christian emphasis on moral judgment, justice, and the terrors of the afterlife.

3. **Japanese Edo Period**: Between 1615 and 1868, Japanese folklore was rich with tales of vengeful entities known as Yūrei (ghosts) and Oni (demons). The Yūrei, typically female spirits, sought vengeance due to an act of betrayal, heartbreak, or abandonment. Their purpose was to hold the living accountable for their misdeeds, resulting in a sense of ongoing suspense and dread. The Oni, fearsome supernatural creatures, embodied the darker aspects of human nature and punished those who broke social norms. Both Yūrei and Oni reinforced the societal importance of honor, duty, and loyalty in Edo Period Japan.

In summary, we have examined several foundational factors contributing to the origin and manifestation of vengeful entities across psychological, cultural, and mythological dimensions. By analyzing historical and cultural examples of these entities in ancient Greece, medieval Europe, and Edo Period Japan, we observed how the concept of revenge and retribution has varied across time yet remained rooted in the human psyche. These manifestations of vengeful entities seek to reestablish balance, enforce societal norms, and highlight moral dilemmas – offering a lens through which we can appreciate the complexity and importance of vengeance in the human experience.
