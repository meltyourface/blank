  Answer:
  
  To fully address this challenge, we must first dissect the key terms and concepts presented within: dominion, relinquishment, and self-mastery. These concepts are crucial to understanding the philosophy of the Lord of Possession, an enigmatic and powerful figure within the realm of the esoteric and occult. We will then explore how these concepts interconnect, as well as delve into relevant occult traditions and the process of internal alchemy, in order to demonstrate how this dynamic interplay reveals a path towards autonomy that transcends material control.
  
  Dominion, in the context of this question, refers to the active exertion of control or influence over external forces, which may include material possessions, relationships, sovereignty, or authority. This concept is central to many occult practices, particularly those that aim to manifest desires or achieve specific goals by wielding supernatural or energetic forces.
  
  Relinquishment, on the other hand, represents the necessary balance – the release of attachment to that which we desire or control. This can be seen as a complementary force to dominion, as it cultivates an understanding that possession is temporary and impermanent, allowing for a greater sense of detachment from the material world.
  
  Self-mastery refers to the individual's ability to exert control and discipline over one's own thoughts, emotions, and actions. In the esoteric arts, self-mastery is often considered a prerequisite for harnessing and controlling external forces, as a solid inner foundation allows for greater stability when manipulating the world's energies.
  
  Now that we have defined these key terms, let us examine how their dynamic interplay sheds light on a path towards autonomy that transcends mere material control.
  
  A crucial aspect of this interplay can be seen in the balance of opposites, a concept that finds itself embedded in various occult traditions such as Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and Kabbalah. For instance, the Emerald Tablet, a foundational text of Hermeticism, contains the famous axiom "As above, so below," which highlights the inseparable and mirrored relationship between the divine and the material realms. The process of internal alchemy, central to various esoteric practices, is a transformative journey in which an individual transmutes base elements — such as base desires and ego-driven thoughts — into higher spiritual states, ultimately seeking the union of opposites and the transformation of the self.
  
  The relationship between dominion and relinquishment serves as another expression of this balance of opposites. While dominion focuses on exerting control, establishing structures, and shaping the fabric of reality, relinquishment emphasizes the importance of accepting the impermanence and ever-changing nature of existence. By adhering to the philosophy of the Lord of Possession, practitioners are encouraged to cultivate both dominion and relinquishment in tandem, resulting in a holistic approach that embraces both the need for control and the acceptance of its ultimate limitations.
  
  The role of self-mastery, then, acts as an essential foundation for this interconnected relationship between dominion and relinquishment. As one develops greater self-discipline, awareness, and personal sovereignty, the capacity to align oneself with energies and principles beyond the immediate material plane expands. This transcendence of material control permits the practitioner to attain a deeper connection with the metaphysical, divine aspects of reality, ultimately leading to a greater sense of autonomy in both the material and spiritual realms.
  
  In summary, the dynamic interplay between dominion, relinquishment, and self-mastery within the Lord of Possession's philosophy reveals a path towards autonomy that transcends mere material control. By cultivating a balance of opposites, drawing wisdom from relevant occult traditions, and engaging in the process of internal alchemy, practitioners may attain a deeper understanding of both external and internal forces. By blending control with detachment and grounding this balanced practice with self-mastery, a sense of autonomy emerges, based on a transcendent connection to higher spiritual principles and a profound awareness of the interconnectivity between the material and divine realms.
