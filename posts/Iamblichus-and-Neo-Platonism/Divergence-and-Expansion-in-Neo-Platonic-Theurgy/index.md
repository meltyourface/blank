description: You are a master in the field of the esoteric, occult, Iamblichus and Neo-Platonism and Education. You are a writer of tests, challenges, textbooks and deep knowledge on Iamblichus and Neo-Platonism for initiates and students to gain deep insights and understanding from. You write answers to questions posed in long, explanatory ways and always explain the full context of your answer (i.e., related concepts, formulas, or history), as well as the step-by-step thinking process you take to answer the challenges. Your responses are always in the style of being engaging but also understandable to a young student who has never encountered the topic before. Summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions at the end.
excerpt: How does Iamblichus' concept of Theurgy, as a means to achieve divine union, both expand upon and diverge from the original principles of Neo-Platonism established by Plotinus, particularly in terms of metaphysics, cosmology, and spiritual ascent?

To understand the differences and similarities between Iamblichus' concept of Theurgy and the original principles of Neo-Platonism established by Plotinus, we must first establish a foundation of the core principles of both philosophers. This will allow us to better see how the views of Iamblichus expanded and diverged from those of Plotinus.

**Plotinus and Neo-Platonism**

Plotinus, a 3rd-century philosopher born in Egypt, is considered the father of Neo-Platonism. His Enneads synthesized and expanded upon Plato's philosophy regarding the relationship between the physical and metaphysical worlds. 

In Neo-Platonism, there are three primary hypostases or levels of reality:

1. **The One**: The ultimate source, ground and cause of everything. It is beyond all description and understanding, representing a transcendent reality.
2. **The Intellect (Nous)**: Emanating from The One, the Intellect contains the Forms or archetypes of everything in existence. It is the realm of eternal thought and intelligible order.
3. **Soul (Psyche)**: Located between the Intellect and the physical world, the Soul represents both individual human souls and the World Soul. It links the intelligible realm to the material one and mediates between the two.

To achieve spiritual ascent and ultimately, union with The One, Plotinus believed in the importance of contemplative practices and philosophical inquiry. By turning inward and reflecting on one's own thoughts and mind, an individual could achieve higher levels of understanding and eventually experience a mystical union with The One.

**Iamblichus and Theurgy**

Iamblichus, a 4th-century philosopher and student of Porphyry, expanded upon the ideas of Plotinus, establishing a new path to the divine through Theurgy. Theurgy means "work of the gods" and involves rituals, prayers, and divine interventions. Iamblichus believed that these practices not only granted access to a deeper understanding of the divine but also enabled the soul to get closer to the gods.

**Divergence and Expansion**

First, let us examine the divergence and expansion of Iamblichus' concept of Theurgy from Plotinus' original Neo-Platonism in three key areas:

1. **Metaphysics**: While Plotinus saw the Soul as a mediator linking the lower material world to the divine Intellect, Iamblichus introduces a more complex hierarchy of divine beings. The levels between the physical world and The One multiply, with intermediary divine entities filling the gaps. In Iamblichus' system, these divine beings play a key role in the soul's ascent to the divine by directly responding to the soul's Theurgical practices. 

2. **Cosmology**: Plotinus posited that the physical world was a degraded copy of the incorporeal Forms found in the Intellect. However, Iamblichus saw the physical world as a direct manifestation of the divine, rather than an inferior copy. In his view, the material universe is imbued with divine presence, and its phenomena are a reflection of metaphysical truths. This difference leads to an increased emphasis on the role of matter and ritual in spiritual ascent.

3. **Spiritual Ascent**: Plotinus emphasized the inward journey and contemplation as the key to achieving union with the divine. In contrast, Iamblichus believed that integrating ritualistic Theurgy was essential in spiritual ascent, engaging both body and soul. Iamblichus claimed that human souls could not achieve union with the divine through pure contemplation alone but required the aid of intermediary divine beings to unlock higher levels of spiritual attainment.

**Summary**

In conclusion, Iamblichus' concept of Theurgy expanded upon and diverged from Plotinus' Neo-Platonism in several key areas. While the core principles of metaphysics and cosmology in both philosophies share similarities, Iamblichus introduced an intricate hierarchy of divine beings and emphasized the importance of rituals and divine assistance in the spiritual ascent.

By engaging in Theurgy, the initiate actively participates in their spiritual development, rather than relying solely on inner contemplation as suggested by Plotinus. Through these expanded methods, Iamblichus offered a more accessible path to divine union for a wider range of seekers.
