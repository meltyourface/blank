To fully understand and respond to the knowledge challenge, let us first break down the key concepts and components involved in the question:

1. Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia: De Occulta Philosophia is a seminal work on the occult and esoteric philosophy penned by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a German magician, occultist, and theologian in the early 16th century. The book is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of the esoteric tradition: the Celestial realm, the Elemental realm, and the Intellectual realm.

2. Harmonization: In the context of esoteric philosophy, harmonization refers to the process of bringing different spheres of reality, often represented by the Celestial, Elemental, and Intellectual realms, into alignment or synchrony.

3. Theurgy: This is a practice involving divine intervention and communion with spiritual entities intended to bring about magical effects or manifestations.

With these concepts clarified, let's now delve into the harmonization of the Celestial, Elemental, and Intellectual realms as it relates to theurgy and its practical application in the alignment with one's higher self amid the journey of self-transformation.

Agrippa emphasized the interconnectedness of all things on multiple levels of existence and the importance of understanding these connections in order to develop one's magical abilities. Harmonizing the Celestial, Elemental and Intellectual realms involves the concept of the 'Magnum Opus' or the 'Great Work', which is the ultimate goal of any serious initiate into the esoteric arts.

The Celestial realm encompasses the domain of the divine and spiritual entities, the macrocosm, and the guiding principles of the universe. It represents the higher aspects of consciousness that exist outside of material reality but have an influence on it. To harmonize oneself with the Celestial realm, a practitioner delves into the study of astrology, angels, and divine forces, aiming to align their own consciousness with the divine order.

**The Elemental realm pertains to the four classical elements**: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, along with the underlying energies, qualities, and principles that constitute the fabric of material reality. This domain is the microcosm upon which the celestial forces manifest and is deeply connected to the human body and the physical senses. Harmonizing with the Elemental realm involves understanding its principles and developing the skills to manipulate and control the four elements through rituals, talismans, and alchemical practices.

The Intellectual realm is concerned with the human mind's capacity to understand the principles governing the Celestial and Elemental realms and apply them to the practitioner's personal development. This domain is characterized by abstract ideas, logic, reasoning, and mental discipline. To harmonize with the Intellectual realm, one must cultivate mental faculties such as concentration, intuition, and wisdom.

In the context of theurgy, harmonizing the three realms allows the practitioner to connect with spiritual entities, divine intelligence, and cosmic forces, resulting in a direct experience of the interconnectedness of all things. Through this contact, a practitioner can invoke the powers of the Celestial realm, manipulate the forces of the Elemental realm, and integrate these insights and transformations into their Intellectual realm.

Practically, the pursuit of harmonization in the context of theurgy often involves methods such as meditation, visualization, astral projection, and ritual invocation. By incorporating these methodologies into daily practice, an individual can gradually attune their consciousness to the different aspects of the three realms and develop a deep understanding of their essence.

As the practitioner develops their ability to harmonize and work with the Celestial, Elemental, and Intellectual realms, they undergo a journey of self-transformation. Their consciousness becomes more refined, and they become capable of aligning their actions and intentions with the divine will. In this process, Agrippa suggests that the individual will align with their higher self â€“ the part of their consciousness that is closest to the divine essence and possesses deep wisdom and insight.

In conclusion, the harmonization of the Celestial, Elemental, and Intellectual realms, as it relates to theurgy, is central to the process of engaging with the divine powers and realizing one's full potential. This harmonization serves as a key to unlocking one's higher self and facilitates the journey of self-transformation, connecting practitioners to the innate wisdom and spiritual guidance that lies within them. Ultimately, this journey is a path of personal growth as well as the realization of one's role in the broader interconnectedness of all aspects of existence.
