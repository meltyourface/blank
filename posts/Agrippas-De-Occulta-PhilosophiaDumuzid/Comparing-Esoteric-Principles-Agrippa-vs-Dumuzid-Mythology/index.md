Answer:

To examine the connection between Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia and the mythology surrounding Dumuzid, it's crucial first to understand the foundation of these two esoteric concepts. Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia is an influential work in Renaissance occult philosophy, while Dumuzid is a significant figure in Sumerian and Babylonian mythology. In this answer, I will provide a brief overview of both concepts, cross-analyze their esoteric principles, and explore how these intricate perceptions may reflect or contradict one another when applied to the comprehensive understanding of the occult.

Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia:

De Occulta Philosophia, or "Three Books of Occult Philosophy," was written by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a German magician, occult writer, theologian, and astrologer. Published in 1531, this work is divided into three books, focusing on natural magic, celestial magic, and ceremonial magic. 
Agrippa's main motive in writing the book was to reconcile variety of thought in the esoteric tradition and to create a systematic approach to occult knowledge. He attempted to harmonize diverse sources such as Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Christian theology to establish a comprehensive understanding of the earthly and heavenly realms.

Dumuzid's Mythology:

Dumuzid is an ancient Mesopotamian deity, often associated with both vegetation and the afterlife. He is a shepherd god, married to the goddess of love, fertility, and warfare, Inanna (also known as Ishtar). Dumuzid's role is mainly tied to the seasonal or cyclical nature of life and vegetation. His mythological story centers around his descent to the underworld, where he takes Inanna's place for half the year while she returns to the earth, representing the seasonal shift from growth and fertility to decay and dormancy.

Cross-analysis of Esoteric Principles:

In examining the connection between their esoteric principles, we can identify several potential points of similarity and difference:

1. Life Cycles and the Natural World:
Both concepts delve into the cycles of life and the natural world, although from different perspectives. Agrippa's natural magic focuses on understanding and harnessing the forces and qualities inherent in the natural world, while Dumuzid's mythology illustrates the seasonal cycles of growth, decay, and renewal through his narrative. These concepts reflect each other, promoting the significance of the natural cycles of life in the esoteric tradition.

2. The Celestial Influence:
Agrippa's celestial magic explores the cosmic influences on the earthly realm, drawing power and knowledge from heavenly bodies such as stars and planets. In Dumuzid's mythology, the celestial aspect comes into play through his wife, Inanna, who is associated with Venus. However, Dumuzid's relationship with celestial influence appears less direct than Agrippa's, focusing on the divine connection rather than a hands-on influence over astrological aspects.

3. Rituals and Ceremonies:
Book Three of De Occulta Philosophia explores ceremonial magic, emphasizing the importance of rituals and invoking divine beings/entities to attain knowledge or power. This concept can relate indirectly to the mythology surrounding Dumuzid, as various cultural practices and rituals were dedicated to him and Inanna in ancient times. However, the purpose and context of these rituals largely differ from the more systematic and focused ceremonial magic suggested by Agrippa's work.

**Conclusion**:

When cross-analyzing Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia and the mythology surrounding Dumuzid in the context of the comprehensive understanding of the occult, we find both reflection and contradiction. They both emphasize the natural cycles and relationships between terrestrial and celestial elements. However, their approaches and focus vary, as Agrippa's work is more systematic, combining various esoteric traditions, while Dumuzid's mythology is more narrative-driven. The differences observed between the systematic, ritualistic approach in Agrippa's work and the more symbolic, narrative nature of Dumuzid's mythology reveal the diverse manifestations of esoteric principles that can coexist, complement, and sometimes contrast within the broader occult tradition.
