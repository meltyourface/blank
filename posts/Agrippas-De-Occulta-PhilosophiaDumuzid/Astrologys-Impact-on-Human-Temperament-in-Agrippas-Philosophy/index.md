Astrology and its connection to human temperament

In Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia, the element most closely related to the influence of celestial bodies on the human body and understanding the metaphysical connections between the microcosm and macrocosm is astrology and its connection to human temperament. 

Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia, also known as Three Books of Occult Philosophy, is an influential work on occult and esoteric philosophy, written in the early 16th century by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. The work is divided into three books: the first focusing on natural magic, the second on celestial and ceremonial magic, and the third on theurgy (the practice of rituals aiming to unite oneself with divine or spiritual beings).

Astrology is a central concept in Agrippa's work, providing a foundation for connecting the earthly (microcosm) and celestial realms (macrocosm). Astrology is the study of the positions and movements of celestial bodies, primarily the planets and stars, and their influence on the natural world and human affairs. In the context of Agrippa's work, astrology helps explain the connections between the celestial realm (macrocosm) and the human body and mind (microcosm).

Human temperament, in the context of astrology, refers to the four temperaments, which are based on the four primary bodily humors (fluids): sanguine (blood), choleric (yellow bile), melancholic (black bile), and phlegmatic (phlegm). According to this theory, the balance of these humors in a person determines their temperament or personality. Astrological factors such as the position of the planets and the signs of the zodiac at one's birth were believed to influence the balance of the humors and, consequently, one's temperament.

The other answer choices are related to De Occulta Philosophia but are not as directly connected to the influence of celestial bodies on the human body and understanding the metaphysical connections between the microcosm and macrocosm:

1. The arrangement of angelic names and correspondences: This refers to the complex system of assigning names and offices to various celestial and spiritual beings, including angels, archangels, and other entities. While this is an important aspect of some occult practices, it is not specifically focused on the influence of celestial bodies on the human body.

2. The use of sympathetic magic to influence one's environment: Sympathetic magic is a type of magic that relies on the idea of "like attracts like" or the principle that similarity between two objects or beings can create an influence or connection between them. While sympathetic magic is a significant component of natural magic and Agrippa's overall philosophy, it is not specifically focused on the celestial influences on the human body and the connection between microcosm and macrocosm.

3. The concept of spiritual and elemental hierarchies in the universe: This is related to Agrippa's and other occultists' views on the organization of the spiritual and elemental beings in the universe and the structure of the natural and celestial realms. Although it does demonstrate the interconnectedness of all things, this concept is more focused on the organization of the cosmos rather than the direct influence of celestial bodies on the human body.

In conclusion, astrology and its connection to human temperament are the most directly related elements to the influence of celestial bodies on the human body and understanding the metaphysical connections between the microcosm and macrocosm in Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia. This concept helps demonstrate the direct link between celestial occurrences and human experiences, connecting the individual to the cosmos in a profoundly intimate way.
