In the context of performative theurgical spiritual tradition, the key distinction between theurgy and traditional incantatory magick is the nature of the interaction between the practitioner and the divine, as well as the ultimate goals and methods employed in each practice. Theurgy emphasizes a direct communion with and channeling of divine entities in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment, while traditional incantatory magick tends to focus on invoking the power of these beings to accomplish practical goals or desires.

To elucidate this distinction, it is important first to understand the underlying premises of each practice. Theurgy, which comes from Greek roots meaning "god-working," is considered a form of divine invocation aimed at achieving unity with the divine and promoting spiritual ascent or enlightenment. In this practice, the practitioner seeks to channel the divine energies through various forms of ritual, meditation, or other spiritual exercises, with the ultimate aim of transcending the material world and attaining a higher state of consciousness or being.

In contrast, traditional incantatory magick is a more pragmatic approach, relying on the invocation and manipulation of divine or supernatural entities to achieve specific objectives or fulfill the desires of the practitioner. Such invocation may involve recitation of spells, incantations, or use of symbolic tools, often in the context of a ritualized setting. The key difference here is that whereas theurgy aspires to spiritual elevation and communion with the divine, incantatory magick tends to prioritize material or worldly outcomes.

However, as with many spiritual traditions and esoteric practices, it is not entirely accurate to consider theurgy and incantatory magick as mutually exclusive paradigms. In fact, there are numerous instances in which the two approaches converge and intertwine, revealing the interconnectedness of their respective methodologies and transcendent goals.

One such example is the practice of planetary invocations, which can be found among various hermetic, ceremonial, and esoteric spiritual traditions. In this context, the practitioner seeks to align with and evoke the energies and powers associated with the celestial bodies, such as the planets and stars, by performing specific invocations, rites, or visualizations. This practice can entail objectives that straddle the boundary between theurgy and incantatory magick â€“ the pursuit of spiritual insight, wisdom, or enlightenment (a theurgical aim), alongside the attainment of practical wisdom or mastery in various aspects of one's life (an incantatory aim).

In summary, the key distinction between theurgy as a form of divine invocation and traditional incantatory magick is the nature of the interaction with the divine and the ultimate goals of the practice. The former emphasizes spiritual ascent and communion, while the latter is more focused on practical or material outcomes. Nevertheless, there are numerous examples of rituals and practices, such as planetary invocations, that demonstrate the convergence of these paradigms and highlight the interconnectedness of their respective methodologies and transcendent goals. It is within these overlaps and synthesis that some of the deeper mysteries and insights of performative theurgical spiritual tradition may be uncovered and understood by the dedicated seeker.
