Within the framework of Performative theurgical spiritual tradition, invoking a thoughtform or servitor encompasses a series of complex and carefully orchestrated steps designed to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual planes, manifesting a temporary autonomous entity with a specific purpose in mind. This process relies on a combination of symbols, invocations, and ritualistic actions to bring forth the desired manifestation.

To begin, it is important to create a conducive atmosphere for invoking thoughtforms or servitors. Make sure your dedicated space is clean, adorned with symbols relevant to the intended outcome, and contains an altar with offerings and focal points for concentration. The atmosphere should promote mental focus, emotional stability, and vibrational harmony with your intent.

Next, prepare your physical body and mind with a thorough process of purification before engaging in the ritual. This typically involves bathing, fasting, or going through a period of contemplation and meditation to clear your mind of mundane distractions and ensure mental clarity.

Once you are ready to embark on the invocation, follow these steps:

1. **Establish a protective circle**: Cast a sacred, protective perimeter around your ritual space to keep out unwanted energies and influences. This can be done by walking clockwise around the edges of your space while envisioning a barrier of energy forming around you, or by sprinkling salt to create a physical representation of the circle.

2. **Call upon guardians and spiritual guides**: Request the assistance from your higher self, spiritual guides, and elemental forces (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) to guide and protect you during the invocation process.

3. **Craft a sigil**: A sigil acts as a symbol for manifesting your thoughtform or servitor and serves as a visual representation of your intention. Combine letters or symbols together that are in harmony with the purpose of your thoughtform or servitor and inscribe it on a piece of paper or parchment.

4. **Charge the sigil**: Empower your sigil by focusing intently on its design and channeling energy into it while keeping your intention in mind. By doing this, you imbue the sigil with your goal, making it an active component in the invocation process.

5. **Pronounce the invocation**: Verbalize your intention in the form of an invocation, while incorporating keywords and phrases that represent your desired outcome. This may include addressing and invoking specific deities, spirits, or archetypes that resonate with your servitor's function, if applicable.

6. **Commune with the servitor**: Once the invocation is complete, imagine the sigil coming to life and opening a portal for the servitor to manifest through. Enter into a deep meditative state and communicate with the servitor as it begins to take form, imparting upon it the specific tasks, limitations, and conditions you have established.

7. **Seal the servitor**: With the servitor now present and attuned to your will, perform a closing gesture (such as placing the sigil in a sealed container or visually surrounding it with a protective barrier) to ensure its energy remains focused and confined to its assigned purpose.

8. **Give thanks and close the ritual**: Express gratitude to the forces, guides, and entities that have assisted you in the invocation process. Release them to return to their realms, and then open the protective circle to conclude the ritual.

Though the specific ritual actions can vary depending on the practitioner's tradition and personal preferences, this general outline demonstrates the breadth and depth of the Performative theurgical spiritual tradition when invoking or creating thoughtforms and servitors. These manifested beings can serve various mystical applications, from aiding in self-improvement endeavors to providing additional energy for large-scale rituals, acting as guardians and protectors, or even operating as intermediaries between the practitioner and other spiritual planes.
