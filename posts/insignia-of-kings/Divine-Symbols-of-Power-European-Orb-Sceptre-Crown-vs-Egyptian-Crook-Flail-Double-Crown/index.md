To fully respond to the knowledge challenge presented, it is essential to first provide an overview of each of the mentioned insignias of kings, within their respective contexts. Within European monarchies, the orb, sceptre, and crown have been visibly used, while within ancient Egyptian civilization, the Pharaohs utilized the crook, flail, and double crown as symbols of power. By dissecting the symbolism, spiritual significance, and relation to different branches of occult knowledge, such as Hermetism and Rosicrucianism, we will be able to establish how these insignias allude to the Sovereignty of the Divine over their respective civilizations.

1. European Orb, Sceptre, and Crown:
The European orb, sceptre, and crown all serve as symbols of divine power bestowed upon the king. The orb represents the Earth and is topped with a cross symbolizing Christ's dominion over the Earth, demonstrating the king's role as a divine intermediary. The sceptre alludes to rulership, authority, and justice and is also topped with a Christian symbol, such as a cross or dove, emphasizing the connection between the king and the divine powers. Lastly, the crown, often adorned with precious stones, signifies the divine right to rule, the protection of the realm, and the king's coronation under God.

2. Egyptian Crook, Flail, and Double Crown:
In ancient Egypt, the crook, flail, and double crown likewise exemplified the divine authority of the Pharaoh. The crook, a staff with a hooked end, signified the Pharaoh's role as a shepherd to his people. The flail, a whip-like instrument, represented discipline, power, and sovereignty. The double crown united the crowns of Upper (white crown) and Lower (red crown) Egypt, consolidating the Pharaoh's authority over a unified land.

Now, let us delve into the connections between the symbolism and spiritual significance of these insignias, and their relation to branches of occult knowledge such as Hermetism and Rosicrucianism:

3. Hermetism:
The Hermetic tradition, inspired by Hermes Trismegistus—a combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth—emphasizes the unity of the spiritual and material world and seeks the hidden knowledge that underlies this connection. Both European and Egyptian insignias allude to Hermetism through their symbolic tie to the gods or divine powers. This link is seen in the European orb, sceptre, and crown, crowned with Christian symbols, and in the Egyptian crook and flail that were believed to be gifted by the gods.

4. Rosicrucianism:
Rosicrucianism is a spiritual and philosophical movement that seeks esoteric wisdom, particularly in relation to alchemy, mysticism, and the divine powers of the universe. The European insignias reveal a connection to Rosicrucianism as the orb, sceptre, and crown embody the spiritual connection between the king, his realm and subjects, and the divine. Similarly, in ancient Egypt, the crook, flail, and double crown emphasize the mystical bond between the Pharaoh and the gods.

In conclusion, both the European orb, sceptre, and crown, and the Egyptian crook, flail, and double crown symbolize the divine authority granted to the respective rulers. These insignias showcase the king's power and responsibility as a chosen instrument of the divine, who rules over his subjects in the material world. The connections to branches of occult knowledge, such as Hermetism and Rosicrucianism, further emphasize the unified spiritual and material significance of these symbols, and their roles in illustrating the Sovereignty of the Divine, granted to the rulers of their respective civilizations. By analyzing these origins and relationships, we can thereby enrich our understanding of the esoteric and spiritual aspects that not only connect these symbols between the two civilizations but also reveal their profound significance across history.
