In golden realms of yore unseen, a tale of regal might we sing,
Of hallowed crowns and scepters tall, and orbs that rule the mortal thrall.
For kings and queens of old weaved myths anew, their emblems bearing magic's hue,
Adorned in symbols rich, sublime, they held the threads of fate and time.

A crown of intricate design, with filigrees that twist and twine,
Gems that glint in heaven's gaze, like stars betwixt the twilight's haze.
Each stone engraved with legend's lore, a covenant of power they bore,
Glimmering rubies, tempest sapphires, emeralds from the dragons' shires.

The topaz told of victories won, the garnet whispered tongues unsung,
A diamond heart to rule the lands, in wisdom blessed by mortal hands.
This circlet not just regal art but a testament to a sovereign's heart,
Honor, courage, strength enshrined within the diadem, gold refined.

Coiled in tales of yesteryear, the scepter's tale professed to hear,
Carved within its core was might, the eminence of ancient rites.
From wood and stone, to iron forged, refined in silver, wisdom’s hoard,
A regal baton danced the past, and in its form a power vast.

The ancient ones, their voices weak, foresaw the tempests heralds creak,
Reflections in the scepter's glow, they carved the runes of every woe.
A cipher to the endless eons, this rod of power did cease their pains,
A beacon for the rightful heir, to wield with might and foresight rare.

Nestled 'twixt the scepter's grasp, a sphere of splendor, truth unmasked,
An orb that captured sun and moon, a mirror of ethereal boons.
Its surface shimmered, ever pure, an omen for the future's lure,
Inscribed in gilded curvatures, the arc of kings, their strength secured.

Floating continents and distant skies, within the orb forever lies,
A journey traced by fingertips, a destiny unveiled in its silver grip.
This emblem of a land united, a sphere of power undivided,
The king's decree encased within, to guide and govern—heaven's wind.

In crown, scepter, orb we find, the long-lost echoes of a regal kind,
From ancient legend's haunted groves, these sacred icons guard their thrones.
So heed the ancient symbol's call, the kings and queens who held them all,
For within their timeless mystery, a herald's cry to history.
