To complete the task, we will focus on three historical monarchies: Ancient Egypt, the British Monarchy, and the French Monarchy. These empires have deep histories enriched with the use of numerology and symbolism.

1. Ancient Egypt:
In the Egyptian royal insignia, the design often featured the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, signifying unity. Numerology played an essential role in the mythology and spiritual practices of ancient Egypt.

One key number was '3', representing balance and harmony. It is evident in the divine trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Additionally, the monarchy often used the sacred number '9,' the Ennead, which represented a group of nine deities ruling over specific elements of creation.

Pharaohs wore a double crown, Pschent, combining the red crown, Deshret, of Lower Egypt and the white crown, Hedjet, of Upper Egypt. This duality often symbolized the number '2,' the principle of dualism that was also rooted in their mythology.

2. British Monarchy:
The British coat of arms and insignia are rich in symbolism. The lion holding the shield symbolizes England, while the unicorn represents Scotland. The intricate design reflects the history of the monarchy and the unity of the two kingdoms since King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England.

In the British royal insignia, numerology is seen in the repetition of key numbers. For example, the Order of the Garter, a chivalric order, consists of 24 knights appointed by the monarch. The number '24' symbolized protection and strength, resonating with the influence and power exerted by the British Empire.

The numbers three and four are also prevalent in the British coat of arms, wherein three lions, roses, and four sections of the shield represent England and various aspects of its history.

3. French Monarchy:
The French royal insignia were characterized by the fleur-de-lis, a stylized lily symbolizing purity and the divine right of the king. Royal mythology ascribes the origin of the fleur-de-lis to an angel who presented the first French king with a vial of holy oil.

Intricacies of the design also reflect lineage connections through the incorporation of other symbols, such as the bees of the Merovingian dynasty. The use of numerology here lies with the repetition of the fleur-de-lis thrice on the royal blue field, symbolizing the Holy Trinity, and the connection of the monarchy to divinity.

To conclude, the royal insignias of Ancient Egypt, the British Monarchy, and the French Monarchy reveal deep connections with symbolism, lineage, and mythology. Numerology played a significant role in communicating these messages and evoking underlying meanings in the arrangement and selection of mystical numbers within their insignias.
