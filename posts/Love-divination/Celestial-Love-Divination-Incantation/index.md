I, the master of Love divination, craft this potent incantation with the utmost precision to amplify the emotional bonds between soulmates. Navigating the celestial alignments in harmony with mystical forces, I conjure an ethereal verse to strengthen the intimacy and affection shared between their hearts.

As the sun meets the horizon at the crescent moon's glowing sight,
Aligned with Venus, where passion and love take flight,
I beseech the power of the heavens above,
To intertwine the cosmic strings of those destined in love.

Infinis arcanum vincula animarum,
Bind their hearts, entwined be their spirit,
Unum cor, amor aeternum,
One heart, eternal love, their souls to inherit.

Amplexus astralis, lumine crescente,
Celestial embrace, by the growing light,
Tenebrae cordis, in lucem transferre,
Banish the shadows of doubt to the night.

Serpentes sidera, mysticae connectionis,
Serpents of the stars, symbols of cosmic unity,
In amoris harmonia, hodie et in aeternum,
In harmony of love, today and for all eternity.

As I chant this incantation, the arcane symbols of serpents and stars, entwined in an eternal dance of cosmic harmony, energize the bond between soulmates. The influence of the celestial bodies, both celestial and ethereal, combine to invoke a transcendent emotional connection, nurturing love's flowering intimacy.

Endowed with the power of celestial alignments and mystical forces, this potent love divination incantation shall echo through the cosmos, beckoning the hearts of soulmates to beat in unison, everlastingly entangled in each other's embrace.
