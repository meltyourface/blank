In designing a sacred sex magick altar layout, it's essential to balance both the aesthetic and the metaphysical aspects to effectively harness and direct sexual energy toward manifestation. Here, I present a sex magick altar layout that incorporates aspects of sacred geometry, color theory, and correspondences.

Layout and Geometry:
The overall shape of the altar layout will be a hexagon, representing the union of the masculine, upward-pointing triangle, and the feminine, downward-pointing triangle. This reflects the balance and interplay of these energies during sexual rituals.

**Centerpiece**:
The centerpiece of the altar is a beautifully sculpted representation of the divine union, such as a statue or image depicting figures in sexual embrace or a symbolic representation of the lingam and yoni. This serves as the central focus for directing sexual energy and intentions.

Ritual Tools:
1. A chalice to represent the womb and the element of water, used to hold a blessed and energized aphrodisiac elixir.
2. A dagger or athame representing the phallus and the element of fire, utilized for ceremonial purposes and symbolizing the piercing of veils and boundaries.
3. A crystal wand to channel and direct sexual energies within the ritual space.
4. A set of pendulums, one for each participant, to assist in divination and facilitate energetic attunement.

Talismans, Amulets, and Enchanted Objects:
1. Rose quartz for heart-opening, emotional healing, and fostering loving connections during rituals.
2. Carnelian for enhancing sexual potency, sensuality, and creativity.
3. Black tourmaline for grounding and protection during energetic work, preventing energy leakage.
4. Lapis lazuli to stimulate intuition and psychic-awareness during sacred sexual encounters.
5. A sigil representing each participant's unique sexual intention, imbued with energy during the ritual and charged by the orgasmic force.

Color Theory and Correspondences:
1. **Red**: Passion, vitality, and desire. Use red candles or cloth to invoke this energy.
2. **Orange**: Pleasure, sensuality, and creativity. Incorporate shades of orange through altar items, such as carnelian or an orange altar cloth.
3. **Pink**: Love, compassion, and emotional intimacy. Utilize pink accents with rose quartz and pink candles.

Arrangement and Placement:
1. Anchor the hexagonal altar with representations of the four elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) at each cardinal point (North, East, South, and West, respectively).
2. Arrange the ritual tools, talismans, amulets, and enchanted objects in accordance with each participant's personal symbolic framework, reinforcing balance and harmony within the sacred space.
3. Place a charged candle at each of the hexagon's points, surrounding the centerpiece with their corresponding colors to support the desired manifestations.

In conclusion, this sex magick altar layout integrates symbolically charged items, sacred geometry, and color correspondences to create a potent environment for harnessing and directing sexual energy. By focusing on the intentions and energies associated with each chosen item, participants can leverage their sexual prowess, intimacy, and connection to manifest desired outcomes.
