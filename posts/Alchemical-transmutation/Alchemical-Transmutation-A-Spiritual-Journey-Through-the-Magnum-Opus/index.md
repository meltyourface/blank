To properly explain the intricate process of Alchemical transmutation through the lens of the Magnum Opus and how it is symbolically paralleled with the spiritual journey of an adept in search for their own inner transformation, it is critical to first provide context about the history and principles of alchemy. Alchemy is an ancient philosophical and proto-scientific tradition that sought to transform base metals into noble metals, with the ultimate goal of discovering the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher's Stone. The Magnum Opus, or the "Great Work," lays out the steps and processes necessary to achieve this transformation in both a literal and metaphorical sense.

The Magnum Opus is divided into four primary stages, each associated with one of the cardinal elements: Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. These stages are further broken down into the sub-stages of Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo, representing different phases of purification and transformation. 

Stage 1: Earth and Nigredo - Calcination and Decomposition

The first step, associated with the element of Earth and the Nigredo stage, is Calcination. This is the process of breaking down a substance through the application of heat, ultimately leading to its decomposition. In a metaphysical sense, Calcination symbolizes the destruction of ego and self-contained belief systems in order for the adept to face their own inner "darkness" and chaos. The spiritual journey thus parallels the decomposition of ego and attachment to material desires, with a goal to cultivate a sense of inner humility and groundedness.

Stage 2: Water and Albedo - Purification and Recombination

Following Calcination, the second stage, associated with the element of Water and the Albedo phase, involves the process of Purification and Recombination. In the physical world, this entails dissolving the remaining substance in water or another solvent and then re-crystallizing the components, signifying purification. Spiritually, this stage corresponds to the adept embracing the process of self-reflection, inner soul searching, and re-assessing their values and priorities. By purifying and rejuvenating their spirit, the adept is able to reconcile the different aspects of their psyche and attain a sense of inner harmony.

Stage 3: Air and Albedo - Sublimation and Separation

The third stage, connected to the element of Air and the continued Albedo phase, is Sublimation. This process involves evaporating a solid substance and condensing the vapor back into a solid, thus separating the impurities. Symbolically, Sublimation represents the adept's ability to elevate their consciousness beyond the realm of material concerns and mundane desires. Through the act of transcendence, the adept gains a deeper understanding of themselves, realizing the interconnectedness of all beings, and the union of opposites.

Stage 4: Fire and Rubedo - Coagulation and Unification

The fourth and final stage can be attributed to the element of Fire and the Rubedo phase. Associated with Coagulation, this step involves the transformation of the purified substance into a new, unified form, often depicted as a red powder or the Philosopher's Stone. In spiritual terms, Coagulation signifies the unification of the adept's purified spirit with their physical body, resulting in an awakened, enlightened individual. This stage is the culmination of the spiritual journeyâ€” that of self-transformation and the discovery of one's true divine nature.

In conclusion, Alchemical transmutation, as depicted through the Magnum Opus, is not only a metaphorical representation of the transformation of base metals into noble metals, but also a spiritual allegory of personal growth and enlightenment. Each stage and sub-stage within the Magnum Opus emphasize different elements and processes, which in turn symbolize various aspects of the adept's spiritual journey. By undergoing Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo phases, tied to the cardinal elements of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, adepts experience inner transformations that ultimately lead to the awakening of their true potential and an understanding of the divine nature that resides within all individuals.
