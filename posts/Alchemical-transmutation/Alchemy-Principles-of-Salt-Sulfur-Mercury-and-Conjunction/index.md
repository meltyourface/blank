The answer is: Salt as the body, Sulfur as the soul, Mercury as the spirit, and the stage of Conjunction

Explanation:
In the complex and often symbolic field of alchemy, the three alchemical principles of Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury represent the foundational elements for transmutation. These core principles have multiple meanings, depending on the level of understanding and context in which they are discussed. 

At the most basic level, they can be understood as substances with distinctive characteristics:
1. Salt (body) - represents the physical, solid, and stable aspect of matter. It is associated with the principle of 'fixity' and the manifestation of substances in tangible form.
2. Sulfur (soul) - symbolizes the dynamic, volatile, and passionate aspect. It possesses the characteristics of combustibility and is often linked to the transformative energies of heat and fire. Thus, it is related to the principle of 'fluidity' or activity in a compound.
3. Mercury (spirit) - embodies the ethereal, vaporous, and transformative properties. Mercury is the mediator between the solid and the fluid, the tangible and the intangible, and it functions as a bridge between the material and spiritual realms. It conveys the attribute of 'volatility' and acts as a unifying force in the alchemical process.

In the context of alchemical transmutation, the 'stage of Conjunction' occurs when the opposing natures of Salt and Sulfur are reconciled and harmonized through the unifying influence of Mercury. It is a critical point when the distinct elements and principles are no longer isolated or separate, but have been blended and synthesized to form a unified product - the Philosopher's Stone. This inert, stable substance is believed to possess the transformative power necessary to transmute base metals into gold, to create the Elixir of Life, and to promote spiritual enlightenment.

The stage of Conjunction is an essential point in the alchemical process, as it signifies the creation of a potent and homogeneous substance that can catalyze further transmutations. The integration of Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury in this phase is the foundation for achieving balance, harmony, and wholeness - both in the material world and the spiritual realm.

Historically, alchemy has been a fusion of early chemistry, philosophy, and mysticism. The works and experiments of alchemists, developed and refined over centuries, have contributed significantly to our contemporary understanding of matter, medicine, and spirituality. Though practical alchemy has been largely superseded by modern chemistry, the principles and symbols of alchemical transmutation continue to influence contemporary spiritual practices and psychological thought, representing the ongoing human quest for transformation, self-discovery, and enlightenment.
