The correct answer is:

- Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, Coagulation

In alchemy, the Great Work, also known as Magnum Opus, is the process of transforming base metals into noble metals, specifically gold, or achieving spiritual transformation and enlightenment. This process is represented by a sequence of seven steps, often connected with seven classical planets and seven operations in alchemy.

Here is the explanation of each step and related concepts:

1. Calcination (Mars): Calcination refers to the first stage of alchemical transformation, which involves the heating and breaking down of a substance. This process is often associated with the planet Mars and the element of fire. In spiritual terms, this represents the burning away of ego, attachments, and false beliefs to uncover the pure essence of one's being.

2. Dissolution (Venus): The second step is dissolution, which involves the liquefaction of a solid. In alchemical terms, it represents the union of opposites, or the yogic process of merging consciousness with unconsciousness. Venus, associated with the element of water, symbolizes the emotional and spiritual purification this stage entails.

3. Separation (Jupiter): In separation, the alchemist isolates the desired components from the undissolved substances. Associated with the expansive nature of Jupiter, this stage symbolizes the analytical mind severing attachments to negative patterns and habits formed in the past.

4. Conjunction (Mercury): Conjunction represents the merging of previously separated components, related to the planet Mercury. In spiritual terms, it signifies the recombination of the purified inner aspects of the individual, representing the union of masculine and feminine energies.

5. Fermentation (Saturn): This stage introduces a new substance (a fermenting agent) to initiate decomposition and reanimation of the matter. Often associated with Saturn, fermentation signifies spiritual decay and regeneration to create a new level of understanding.

6. Distillation (Moon): Distillation is the process of purifying a substance through consecutive evaporations and condensations. In alchemy, this stage correlates with the Moon, the symbol of emotional energy. The distillation process further refines the individual's consciousness by processing emotional experiences, integrating the personal and collective unconscious.

7. Coagulation (Sun): The final stage, coagulation, involves solidifying the purified essence into a permanent, perfect state. It represents the culmination of the Great Work by integrating the higher spiritual aspects with the physical body. The Sun is the symbol of this stage, representing both enlightenment and completion.

The correct sequence provided above represents the traditional order of these seven stages followed by alchemists in their pursuit of achieving the Magnum Opus. These stages not only apply to physical transformation but also to spiritual and psychological growth.
