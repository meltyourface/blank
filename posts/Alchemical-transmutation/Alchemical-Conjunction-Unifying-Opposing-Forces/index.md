Conjunction

In the process of alchemical transmutation, the stage known for involving the purification and unification of opposing aspects to achieve a new balanced state is called conjunction. The reasoning behind choosing this answer stems from the understanding of the various stages of the alchemical process and their respective characteristics.

Alchemy, the forerunner to modern chemistry, was based on the idea of transforming base metals into precious metals, such as gold, as well as discovering the fabled elixir of immortality. Over time, this practice came to symbolize a form of spiritual evolution and transformation. The alchemical process is often divided into different stages, which can vary depending on the sources and interpretations. However, they generally include the following:

1. Calcination: The process of breaking down a substance using intense heat, which signifies the removal of impurities and the purification of the foundational elements.
2. Dissolution: Involves dissolving the substance in water or some other solvent, representing an amalgamation of individual aspects for further purification.
3. Separation: The process of isolating the purified components from the impurities that were extracted during the previous stages.
4. Conjunction: This stage represents the unification of the purified components into a new, balanced substance. It is the integration of opposing forces, such as masculine and feminine, or the spiritual and the material, to achieve inner harmony in the individual or a new substance.
5. Fermentation: The process of decomposition and subsequent regrowth, often symbolized by death and rebirth, which allows for new insights and development.
6. Distillation: A refinement technique often used to purify a substance by separating components based on their boiling points, representing the purification of the soul in alchemy.
7. Coagulation: The final stage that signifies the transformation into a solid form, representing the achievement of desired goals or the formation of philosophical gold or the philosopherâ€™s stone.

The other answer options:
- Multiplication: This is a further stage that comes after conjunction and signifies an increase in potency and power. Multiplication is not considered the unification or balancing stage.
- Quintessence: This term refers to the concept of a "fifth element" or an essence that is present in all things. It is not a specific stage of the alchemical process but provides an essential substance to be used in various stages.
- Calcination: This option is incorrect, as we have already explained that calcination is the initial stage involving the breakdown and purification of elements but not their unification or the achievement of a balanced state.

In conclusion, the conjunction stage of the alchemical process involves the purification and unification of opposing aspects to achieve a new balanced state. This understanding comes from a comprehensive knowledge of the stages and principles of alchemical transmutation, which holds deep symbolic significance for spiritual transformation and personal growth.
