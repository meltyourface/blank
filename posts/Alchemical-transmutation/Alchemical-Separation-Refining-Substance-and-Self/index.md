3. Separation

In the process of Alchemical transmutation, the step that involves the separation of the volatile and fixed components in order to refine the substance is Separation. Alchemical transmutation is a series of processes aimed at purifying and transforming base materials, often with the goal of creating the Philosopher's Stone or the Elixir of Life. The process involves various stages, each playing a crucial role in achieving the desired result.

The four options provided - Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, and Conjunction - are part of the seven primary operations of alchemy. Each operation represents a distinct phase of alchemical work and serves a specific purpose in the overall process.

1. Calcination: This is the first operation in the series and involves the process of breaking down a substance through heating or burning, which usually results in a dry, powdery residue. This represents the destruction of the ego and the burning away of impurities in one's base nature.

2. Dissolution: The second operation, dissolution, involves dissolving the calcined material in water or another solvent. This process signifies the breaking down of hardened patterns and boundaries, making it easier for the component elements to come together in new and useful configurations.

3. Separation: The third operation, separation, is the one you asked about. In this phase, the volatile, subtle, and fixed components of the substance are separated and purified. The aim here is to isolate and refine the desired components from the less desirable ones. In a spiritual context, this stage represents the process of discerning and discarding negative or unproductive thoughts and emotions from the essential self.

4. Conjunction: The fourth operation, conjunction, involves the recombination of the purified elements from the process of separation to create a new, transformed substance. This stage signifies the coming together of the alchemist's purified internal and external aspects, resulting in a rebirth or renewal of the self.

The remaining three primary operations are fermentation, distillation, and coagulation, which continue the process of purification and transformation.

In conclusion, separation is the step in the process of Alchemical transmutation that involves separating and refining the volatile and fixed components of a substance. Understanding the stages of this process provides insight into the principles of transformation and spiritual growth that underlie alchemical work.
