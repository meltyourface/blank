To answer this knowledge challenge, let's first define and understand the key concepts related to the ritual altar space, such as elemental correspondences, deities, and astrological influences. 

Elemental correspondences refer to the association of each element (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) with specific qualities, symbolism, and energies. Deities are supernatural beings or gods that people worship or invoke to seek assistance, blessings, and guidance. Astrological influences involve the positioning of celestial bodies like the sun, the moon, and the planets, and their potential impact on human affairs and events.

Now, let's discuss the step-by-step process for designing a ritual altar space that incorporates these concepts and maximizes the potency of a self-transformation working:

1. ****Determine the purpose****: The first step in designing an altar space is to identify the specific intention for the self-transformation working. This could be personal development, spiritual growth, or healing from past traumas. 

2. ****Choose the elemental correspondences****: Based on the intention, select the elements that align with your goal. For example, if you seek emotional healing, you might choose Water as the primary element, with supporting elements such as Earth for grounding or Air for mental clarity.

3. ****Place elemental representations****: Arrange representations of the chosen elements on the altar. These could be physical objects, symbols, or colors that resonate with the specific elements (e.g., a bowl of water or a blue candle for Water). 

4. ****Select the deities****: Research and identify deities from various traditions that correspond with your working's intention or resonate with your personal spiritual path. For a self-transformation working, you might consider deities that are linked to change, growth, and wisdom, such as Greek goddess Athena, Egyptian god Thoth, or Hindu deity Ganesha.

5. ****Position deity representations****: Place images, statues, or symbols of your chosen deities on the altar, while ensuring they are treated with reverence and respect. Offerings such as flowers, incense, or a specific food item can also be presented to foster a connection with the deities.

6. ****Incorporate astrological influences****: Determine the astrological factors that are most aligned with your self-transformation working, such as zodiac signs or lunar phase. For instance, a new moon represents new beginnings and is ideal for initiating self-improvement efforts. You might also consider planetary placements that signify personal growth or align with your birth chart.

7. ****Personalize the altar****: Add any personal items or tools that hold spiritual significance or are connected to your self-transformation intention, such as talismans, photographs, or crystals.
   
8. ****Arrange the altar****: Arrange all components of the altar in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and allows energy to flow freely. You can follow traditional symbolic layouts or rely on your intuition and creativity.

By incorporating elemental correspondences, deities, and astrological influences into the design of a ritual altar space, you create a sacred environment that becomes a focal point for your intention and draws on powerful energetic connections. This synergy enhances the potency and effectiveness of the self-transformation working, ultimately facilitating personal growth and spiritual development.

To summarize, the key themes in this knowledge challenge involve understanding the significance of elemental correspondences, deities, and astrological influences, and incorporating them into the design of a ritual altar space to enhance the potency and effectiveness of a self-transformation working. The step-by-step process includes determining the purpose, choosing and placing elemental representations, selecting and positioning deities, incorporating astrological influences, personalizing the altar, and arranging the components in a harmonious and energetically conducive layout.
