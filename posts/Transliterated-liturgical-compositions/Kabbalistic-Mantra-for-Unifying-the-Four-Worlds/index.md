excerpt: >
  Compose a transcendent and esoteric mantra, incorporating the mystical names of each of the Four Worlds in Kabbalistic cosmology \u2013 Atziluth, Beri'ah, Yetzirah, and Assiyah. The mantra should reflect the unique characteristics and energy emanating from each realm while seamlessly blending their essence to create a harmonious synergy to aid practitioners in elevating their spiritual consciousness during the recitation of this Transliterated liturgical composition. Additionally, experiment with blending ancient Hebrew or Aramaic textual elements to further enhance the depth and potency of the mantra.

In the spirit of transcending and esoteric wisdom, I present the following Transliterated liturgical composition incorporating the Four Worlds of Kabbalistic cosmology – Atziluth, Beri'ah, Yetzirah, and Assiyah – and interweaving ancient Hebrew and Aramaic textual elements.

**Atziluth**: אֲצִילוּת
Beri'ah: בְּרִיָּה
Yetzirah: יְצִירָה
Assiyah: עֲשִׂיָּה

**Mantra**:

A'tzil Bari Y'tzir As'iy
אַצְּלֵי בַּרִי יִצַּר עֲשַׂיְאֵל

(Resonate) Shefa Atziluth, Mechetzar Beri'ah
רִנַּעוּת שֶׁפְעַאְת אֲצָיִלוּת מִכִּתִּין בְּרִיָּה

(Gather) Koli Yetzirah, Tovah Assiyah
קוֹלִי יְצַירַת אֵל טוּבַע אַסָίִיָיה

This mantra unifies the energies of the Four Worlds, connecting the highest divine emanations with the most concrete and receptive realms of creation. Through the repetition and resonance of this mantra, practitioners may find themselves lifted above the mundane and ordinary levels of consciousness.

**Translation**:

Emanate and well Bari's chamber,
Let the echo of Atziluth resound,
Gather voices of creation's foundation,
Bear the goodness of Assiyah's ground
