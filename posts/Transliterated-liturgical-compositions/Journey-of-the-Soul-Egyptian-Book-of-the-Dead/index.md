Of whispered secrets and hidden lore,
A tale unfolds of the ancient shore,
From the sacred text of eternal rest,
A chapter chosen from the Book of the Best.

Upon the mirror of waters, the soul embarks,
A voyage through the night, to the morning's sparks,
In the Duat, where scarabs roll the sun,
The balance is weighed, and each soul is judged by the One.

"Oh Anubis, Guardian of the Scales, receive me,
In feather-light whispers and shadows, I craved to be free,
For I was of the living, my heart pulsing in the rite,
But in death, I seek the redemption hidden in the eternal night."

As the soul approaches, the deity of ebony hue,
Anubis stands, his truth unwavering and stare piercing through,
He begins the ritual of Ma'at, the goddess of balance and law,
A ceremony divine, of a nature no mortal ever saw.

The sacred balance, of gold and gems wrought,
Awaits the heart of the soul, with sin and secrets fraught,
The feather of truth, from Ma'at's own plume,
Determines life renewed, or a descent into doom.

"Oh, Ammit, dreaded Eater of the Dead,
Turn your gaze from me, and let me pass instead,
I stand in trembling awe, by the shores of the river's bend,
And hope my heart is found true, on the judgment you shall send."

As the heart is placed by Anubis against the feather's grace,
An eternal pause holds as the soul trembles at the test it will face,
The drama unfolds, silent save for the breaths of deities,
And the otherworldly murmurs of an age beyond life's pleasantries.

In a moment laden with fate, the scales tip,
Towards redemption and freedom, thus continuing the trip,
"Your heart is scarred yet true, the balance in your favor,
Of eternal life be gifted, and your soulâ€™s journey to savor."

Through the complex maze of winding dreams and visions,
The soul's passage then transcends, ascending with a precision,
Past the realms of deities and spirits, where Horus waits,
In a hall of splendid reflections, the Field of Reeds he consecrates.

"Oh, Horus, initiate of the cosmic eye,
Let thy celestial truth, with my heart's deepest cry,
Hold me humbly in thy embrace, as I enter this divine realm,
Where eternal life sprouts from the testimony, at truth's shining helm."

And thus, the soul passes into the afterlife, its fate rewritten,
In the vast tapestry of existence, its place infinite and fitting,
Adorning the heavens with a starlit note, as the tale is cast,
To the winds of eternity, forevermore, and with mastery unsurpassed.
