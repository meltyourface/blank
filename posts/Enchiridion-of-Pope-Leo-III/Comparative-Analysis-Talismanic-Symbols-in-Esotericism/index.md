To answer the given knowledge challenge, we must first have a comprehensive understanding of the talismanic symbols present in the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III. Once we have identified those symbols, we can compare them with symbols from other esoteric traditions. Finally, the theological implications of these similarities and differences will be discussed in the context of divine intervention in one's life.

The Enchiridion of Pope Leo III is a grimoire, a book of magical knowledge from the 13th century, which is falsely attributed to Pope Leo III. The Enchiridion contains a mix of prayers, charms, talismans, and various signs and writings connected to the Christian faith. Many of those symbols possess a talismanic nature, which implies that they bring luck or protect those who wear or use them.

Talismanic symbols in the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III include:

1. **Christian Symbols**: With its strong link to Christianity, the Enchiridion predominantly features Christian symbols, such as the Cross, the Chi Rho (a monogram representing the first two letters of Christ's name in Greek), and other symbols representing Christ or the Trinity.

2. **Celestial Symbols**: The Enchiridion contains symbols associated with celestial bodies, particularly the planets (e.g., Saturn, Mars, Mercury). These astrological symbols are linked to the magical properties believed to be influenced by the planets.

3. **Angelic Symbols**: Angelic characters or sigils are also present in the Enchiridion. These symbols represent the names of powerful angels, who can be invoked for protection or assistance.

Comparing these symbols with those found in other esoteric traditions, we find some similarities and differences:

1. **Kabbalah**: The Kabbalistic tradition, specifically the Jewish mystical system, has striking similarities with the Enchiridion. Both encompass angelic symbols, as invoking angels for protection and guidance is common in Kabbalistic practice.

2. **Hermeticism**: Another Western esoteric tradition, Hermeticism, shares similarities with the Enchiridion, particularly in the use of celestial symbols. Both traditions believe in the influence of cosmic forces on individual lives, and the Enchiridion has a Hermetic flair in its approach to astrology.

3. **Eastern Traditions**: Symbols in the Enchiridion differ significantly from those of Eastern esoteric systems, such as Taoism and Hinduism. Those systems focus more on chakras, mudras, and mandalas, which have distinct spiritual and meditative purposes compared to the Enchiridion's Christian, angelic, and astral symbolism.

Considering these comparisons, the theological implications of these similarities and differences lie in the overarching theme of divine intervention in people's lives:

1. **Shared Belief in Higher Powers**: Regardless of the specific tradition or symbols employed, the Enchiridion and other esoteric systems' talismanic symbols share a belief in higher powers, be it Christian entities, angels, or celestial bodies. These powers are invoked for assistance, protection, and guidance.

2. **Adaptability of Symbols**: Esoteric traditions, including the Enchiridion, demonstrate the adaptability and fluidity of symbols. Symbols from various traditions have been borrowed and repurposed, sometimes syncretically, reinforcing the idea that divine intervention transcends religious boundaries.

3. **The Role of the Practitioner**: Despite the reliance on higher powers, the use of talismanic symbols highlights the active role played by the practitioner. In the Enchiridion or any other esoteric tradition, the practitioner's responsibility is to understand, create, and use talismans to facilitate divine intervention in their own life. Thus, the individual possesses a certain amount of agency when it comes to spiritual growth and divine protection.

In summary, the talismanic symbols in the Enchiridion of Pope Leo III share similarities and differences with symbols from other esoteric traditions, such as Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Eastern systems. The theological implications of these symbols focus on the shared belief in higher powers, the adaptability and fluidity of symbols, and the active role of the practitioner in facilitating divine intervention. While the Enchiridion has a strong Christian context, its symbols underscore the universality of human desire for divine protection, guidance, and assistance across a variety of religious and spiritual systems.
