It is believed to have been written in the 13th century, though the first known publication dates back to 1523. The Enchiridion, also referred to as the "Handbook of Pope Leo," is a collection of talismans, occult rituals, and prayers that were considered to be extremely powerful during the time of its creation. This section aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the Enchiridion, its historical significance, key elements, and practical applications in their spiritual and occult journey.

History

The Enchiridion of Pope Leo III is often traced back to Pope Leo III (c. 750-816), who was one of the most influential pontiffs of the early medieval period.
