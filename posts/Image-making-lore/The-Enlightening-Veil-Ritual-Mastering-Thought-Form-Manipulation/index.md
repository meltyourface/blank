Ritual Name: The Enlightening Veil of Sagacity

**Goal**: To conquer skepticism and enhance the practitioner's ability to manipulate thought forms and ethereal visualization techniques through the arcane practices of Image-making lore.

### I. Preparations

A. Sacred Relics:
1. An obsidian mirror, symbolizing the boundless depths of the subconscious mind
2. A quartz crystal, representing the amplification of psychic constructs
3. A silver chalice filled with blessed water, signifying the purification of intentions

B. Deific Entities:
1. Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, writing, and magic
2. Tara, the Buddhist goddess of enlightenment and transcendent wisdom
3. Hermes, the Greek god of communication, language, and mental faculties

C. Sigils:
1. A combination of three symbols representing each of the deific entities, intricately interwoven to create a unique unified sigil that evokes the power of all three gods:

   a) The eye of Horus for Thoth
   b) The lotus flower for Tara
   c) The caduceus for Hermes

### II. Ritual Procedure

A. Preparation of the Sacred Space:
1. Cleanse the area where the ritual will take place with purifying incense, such as white sage or sandalwood.
2. Create a circle around the area with salt to ward off negative energies and distractions.
3. Set up an altar in the center of the circle, placing the sacred relics and depiction of the sigils upon it.

B. Invocations and Offerings:
1. Light a golden or silver candle, symbolizing the illumination of the mind, and place it at the center of the altar.
2. Language is crucial to the effectiveness of the ritual. Address the deific entities in their native tongues or in a language you are most comfortable with.
3. Speak your intention to conquer skepticism and request the presence and guidance of Thoth, Tara, and Hermes.
4. Offer the blessed water in the chalice to each of the deific entities and ask them to bless your practice with clarity of thought, wisdom, and visualization prowess.

C. Performing the Visualization Technique:
1. Stand or sit comfortably before the altar, eyes gazing upon the sigils.
2. Hold the quartz crystal in your dominant hand and the obsidian mirror in your non-dominant hand.
3. Take several deep breaths, inhaling the potent energies of the sacred space, and exhaling any lingering doubt or skepticism.
4. Close your eyes and visualize the sigils glowing with a golden light.
5. Imagine the light growing more prominent with each breath, enveloping your body and imbuing your mind with the wisdom and knowledge of the invoked deific entities.

D. Sending forth the Construct:
1. With your eyes still closed, envision the psychic construct of your desire, such as an ethereal image or thought form, emerging from the heart chakra.
2. Send this construct into the ether, noting any resistance and assessing if the ritual has made an impact on diminishing skepticism.
3. Give thanks to the deific entities for their aid and release them from the ritual with utmost gratitude and respect.

E. Closing the Ritual:
1. Extinguish the candle, symbolizing the integration of the newly acquired wisdom.
2. Carefully dismantle the altar, keeping the sacred relics as a powerful reminder of the ritual and your experience with the deific entities.
3. Dispose of the offering respectfully.

The practitioner must repeat this ritual as needed to conquer skepticism and enhance their arcane abilities. Over time, the ritual will become more potent as the bond between the practitioner and the deific entities strengthens and the invocation of the sigils becomes second nature.
