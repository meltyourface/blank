To complete this task, I will select an ancient manuscript, the Voynich Manuscript, an enigmatic illustrated codex believed to have been written in the early 15th century, featuring unidentified writings and various illustrations. It remains undeciphered to this day, making it an ideal candidate to unravel the hidden numerological significances and occult symbolism embedded within it.

Step 1: Preparation
Begin by gathering quality digital scans of the Voynich Manuscript. Next, familiarize yourself with the manuscript's content by researching scholarly articles and books about it.

Step 2: Identify esoteric numerology systems
Study various esoteric numerological systems, such as Pythagorean, Chaldean, Kabbalistic, and Agrippan numerology. These systems will allow you to assign numerical values to letters, words, and symbols within the manuscript, helping to decipher the encoded information.

Step 3: Transcribe and translate the manuscript
Using the Gematria method, transcribe the manuscript's unknown script into a known language, such as Hebrew or Greek, assigning numerical values to each character/symbol. 

Step 4: Identify numerical patterns and cryptic messages
Analyze the manuscript's numerical patterns, including repetitive sequences, mathematical relationships, and significant numbers. Keep an eye out for any hidden messages and possible codes.

Step 5: Interpret the symbolism
Comment on the manuscript's symbols and illustrations, taking a multi-disciplinary approach by analyzing the artistic styles, cultural references, religious and alchemical symbolism. Note any associations between the symbolism and numerology, and gather insight on how these elements relate.

Step 6: Establish the manuscript's significance
Consider the historical context of the manuscript, the prevailing beliefs, and cultural practices of its time. Research how the numerological and symbolic elements connect to the larger esoteric, alchemical, and spiritual traditions of the era.

Step 7: Formulate a comprehensive thesis
Synthesize the gathered information into a coherent interpretation of the Voynich Manuscript's hidden numerological and occult significance, identifying the intended purpose, authorship, and possible historical context of its creation.

In summary, by applying a rigorous method of esoteric numerology analysis and arcane knowledge to the Voynich Manuscript, we can potentially decipher the complex patterns, associations, and cryptic messages, allowing the enigmatic text to reveal its secrets to us. This approach would offer new insights into both the manuscript itself and the broader context of occultism during its time.
