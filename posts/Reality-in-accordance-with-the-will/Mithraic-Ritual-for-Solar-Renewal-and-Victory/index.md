1. **Precise identification of the aeonic current**:
For this ritual, I have chosen to connect with the aeonic current of the Mithras, a powerful and mysterious mystical tradition with roots in ancient Persia and Rome. As a solar deity, Mithras embodies the power of victory, truth, and renewal, making it an ideal current to align with for this ceremonial rite.

2. **Research on the history, symbology, and essential practices**:
The worship of Mithras centers around the tauroctony, a symbolic scene wherein Mithras slays a bull. The slaying of the bull represents the triumph of consciousness over the material world, and the subsequent transformation and enlightenment that follows. In the Roman interpretation, Mithras was also associated with the astrological cosmos and the equinoxes.

3. **Design of the ritual space embodying the essence of the chosen current**:
The ritual space will be arranged to represent a Mithraeum, an underground temple that traditionally houses Mithraic ceremonies. The walls will be painted with celestial symbols, stars, and constellations. A central altar with a relief of the tauroctony will be placed along the east-west axis, aligning with the sun. The room will be dimly lit, with candles representing the seven grades of initiation in Mithraism. The space will be purified with smudging herbs such as sage, and incense, such as frankincense, will burn throughout the ceremony.

4. **Step-by-step ritual process**:
A. Prepare yourself for the ritual by bathing, dressing in a white robe, and entering a meditative state, focusing on your intention to connect with the Mithras current.
B. Enter the ritual space and walk clockwise around the altar three times, honoring the gods of earth, sky, and cosmos.
C. Stand in front of the tauroctony relief, adopting the Mithraic stance, with arms raised and palms outward.
D. **Invoke the Mithras by reciting the following dedication**: "I stand in the presence of mighty Mithras, the unconquerable sun, the ageless wisdom, and continuum of renewal. Unbind me from the material chains, and enlighten me on the path to triumph."
E. Perform the sacred gestures or mudras, such as the "Vir" (warrior) and the "Pater" (father), while visualizing the transformation of your consciousness.
F. Meditate upon the tauroctony scene, focusing on the bull's sacrifice and the subsequent rejuvenation that ensues.

5. **Incorporation of specific elements to deepen engagement**:
A. **Chant the mantra**: "Sol Invictus Mithras" to enhance your connection with the current.
B. Trace the astrological sigil for Mithras in the air above the altar.
C. Hold a talisman (such as a Mithraic gem) throughout the duration of the ritual to bring the energy of the current into your physical body.

6. **Documentation and contemplation**:
After completing the ritual, journal your experiences, including any insights, visions, or synchronicities that arose. Reflect on their meaning within the context of your personal journey and your alignment with the Mithras aeonic current. Consider the ritual's teachings in your daily life, striving for wisdom, renewal, and triumph over adversity.
