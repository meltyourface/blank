The belief that voluntary actions and thoughts can shape reality by influencing external circumstances and events.

In the context of occultism and esotericism, the concept of "Reality in accordance with the will" refers to the belief that voluntary actions and thoughts can shape reality by influencing external circumstances and events. The idea is that, through focused intention and deliberate action, an individual can bring about desired outcomes or changes in their reality. This concept is central to many magical and occult practices, and has been a subject of study and interest for centuries.

The reasoning behind this concept is rooted in the idea that the universe and all that exists within it are interconnected, and that all aspects of reality are in some way malleable or subject to change. The power of the human will and consciousness is thought to play a crucial role in this process.

Several related concepts and practices support the idea of reality in accordance with the will, such as:

1. **The Law of Attraction**: A widely popularized concept in the realm of New Thought and self-help literature, the Law of Attraction asserts that an individual's thoughts and feelings can manifest corresponding events and outcomes.

2. **Magical Rituals**: Rituals within many esoteric and occult traditions, such as ceremonial magick, hoodoo, and witchcraft, are often centered around the idea that their practice can influence reality and bring forth desired outcomes.

3. **Sigils**: Magical symbols called sigils are often used to represent specific, focused intentions or desires. The belief is that by imbuing these symbols with one's intention and activating them (for example, through meditation or other rituals), one can influence reality.

4. **The concept of Intent**: In some esoteric traditions, Intent (with a capital I) is regarded as the driving force behind reality, which can be influenced by an individual's intentions and actions.

Historically, many magical and esoteric practitioners have believed that they can exert control over reality using various rituals, symbols, and techniques. While empirical research on the effectiveness of these methods is limited, the belief in their efficacy has continued to resonate with many individuals interested in esotericism and the occult.

In summary, the concept of "Reality in accordance with the will" can be best understood as the belief that thoughts, intentions, and actions have the power to shape reality or influence external circumstances. This belief has deep roots in various magical and esoteric traditions and informs many related practices and concepts.
