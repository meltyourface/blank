The Advanced Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram for Astral Projection (ALBRP-AP) incorporates elements from the Sorcerous Formulae of Number and Sign to enhance and facilitate astral projection. Follow the outlined steps to perform the ritual:

Preparation:
1. Choose a quiet, comfortable space where you can perform the ritual uninterrupted.
2. Gather the necessary ritual tools and materials: a ritual dagger or wand, incense (preferably sandalwood or frankincense), a chalice filled with water, and a plate with salt or earth.
**Step 1**: Numerical Sequences
1. Begin by inscribing the numbers 13, 21, and 34 in a triangular arrangement on the floor where you will perform the ritual. These Fibonacci numbers are derived from the Sorcerous Formulae and strengthen the power of the ritual symbols.
2. Stand within the triangle and visualize the numbers glowing with radiant energy.
**Step 2**: Signs and Sigils
1. At each of the three points of the triangle, inscribe the newly designed esoteric signs: a. At the top point, draw the Sigil of Astral Union, representing the fusion of physical and astral bodies. b. At the bottom left, draw the Sigil of Astral Protection, a shield against negative energies during astral projection. c. At the bottom right, draw the Sigil of Astral Opening, symbolizing the gateway to astral planes.
2. Charge these sigils with intense focus and intention.
**Step 3**: Incantations and Invocations
1. Stand in the center of the triangle, facing east. With your ritual dagger or wand, trace a large invoking pentagram in the air and vibrate the following invocation, based on the Sorcerous Formulae: "Aethyr Invictus Solaris!"
2. Turn to the south and repeat the process, vibrating: "Aethyr Magnus Ignis!"
3. Turn to the west and repeat, vibrating: "Aethyr Profundus Aqua!"
4. Finally, turn to the north and repeat, vibrating: "Aethyr Stoicus Terra!"
**Step 4**: Channeling Energies with Ritual Tools
1. Light the incense, representing the element of air and the power of the intellect. Meditate on the smoke as it fills the room, carrying your intent to the astral realms.
2. Sprinkle water from the chalice at the triangle's points, symbolizing the element of water and connection to the subconscious mind. Visualize yourself cleansing and purifying the astral pathways.
3. Take a pinch of salt or earth and sprinkle it on the sigils, representing the element of earth and the grounding force for safety in astral projection.
**Step 5**: Entering the Astral State
1. Sit or lie down within the triangle, breathing deeply and evenly.
2. Allow your conscious mind to enter a state of profound relaxation, visualizing the activated sigils as gateways into the astral realms.
3. As you begin to feel the sensations associated with astral projection, allow yourself to undergo the process fully and trust in the power of the Advanced Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.

After completing the ritual and embarking on an astral journey, evaluate its performance through a series of increasingly complex trials. Assess the efficacy of the ALBRP-AP in enabling astral projection, safety, and the richness of the experience. Tweak and optimize the process as necessary, improving your mastery over the energies and techniques involved.
