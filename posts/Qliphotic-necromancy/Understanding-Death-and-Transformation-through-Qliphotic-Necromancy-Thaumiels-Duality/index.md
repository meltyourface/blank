- Thaumiel, the duality that encompasses both destructive and regenerative forces

In Qliphotic necromancy, Thaumiel represents the culmination of the practitioner's understanding of death and the process of transformation it entails, while also highlighting the interconnected nature of life and death forces. Thaumiel, also known as the "Twin Gods" or the "Antithetical Principle," signifies the duality of existence and the balance between opposing forces.

The Qliphoth, also called the Tree of Death or the Sitra Achra (the "Other Side"), is a structure in esoteric Jewish and Hermetic Kabbalistic teachings that represents the dark, primal energies and chaotic forces that counterbalance the positive, creative energies of the Sephiroth, or the Tree of Life. The Qliphoth contains ten spheres like the Sephiroth; however, these spheres are associated with destructive and disruptive forces that present challenges and obstacles to spiritual growth.

Thaumiel, found in the highest sphere of the Qliphoth, represents the duality that embodies both destructive and regenerative forces. As a culmination of understanding death and transformation, practicing Qliphotic necromancy involves working with the forces of Thaumiel to harness the dual principles of creation and destruction. This duality is essential in understanding the interconnected nature of life and death, and how one cannot exist without the other.

In contrast, Samael, Gamaliel, and Chokmah are not as directly related to the understanding of death and transformation in Qliphotic necromancy as Thaumiel. Samael, associated with the fifth sphere of the Qliphoth, represents the poisonous and venomous energies that induce altered states of consciousness. Gamaliel, found in the second sphere of the Qliphoth, symbolizes the lunar energies that govern darkness, mystery, and the unknown. Chokmah, on the other hand, is not a part of the Qliphoth and is actually the second sphere of the Sephiroth, representing the energetic force of wisdom and transcendent knowledge.

In summary, Thaumiel is the aspect in Qliphotic necromancy that most directly represents the practitioner's understanding of death and transformation, as well as the interconnected nature of life and death forces. By working with the duality of Thaumiel, practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of the balance between creation and destruction in the ever-changing cycles of existence.
