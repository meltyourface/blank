1. Invocation of Specific Qliphothic Emanations:

Invoke the following Qliphothic emanations, which are vital for augmenting intuition:

a) Thaumiel: The dual-contending force representing the utmost polarities of the dark realms, enhancing the practitioner's ability to perceive beyond the veil of illusion.

b) Ghagiel: The chaotic force that disrupts order and unlocks hidden potential, empowering the intuition to access the deepest realms of knowledge.

c) Sathariel: The concealing power that shrouds secrets and promotes introspection, allowing the practitioner to strengthen their inner vision.

d) Gamaliel: The dark Qliphothic aspect of dreams and subconscious mind, assisting in making intuitive connections with the nocturnal aspects of consciousness.

2. Ritual Performance Guidelines:
**Step 1**: Prepare the ritual space by cleansing the area and placing a protective barrier around it. 
**Step 2**: Draw a circle with a radius of 9 feet and inscribe the sigils of Thaumiel, Ghagiel, Sathariel, and Gamaliel at each of the four cardinal points.
**Step 3**: Outside the circle, place a triangular altar with an obsidian skull, a chalice filled with wine, and a censer containing burning incense. Arrange these in a manner that represents each Qliphothic emanation.
**Step 4**: Enter the circle and stand in the center. Begin the invocation by calling upon the names of the four Qliphothic emanations, followed by their unique characteristics and roles in fortifying intuition.
**Step 5**: Recite a prayer or chant that strengthens the connection with the dark realms and the Qliphothic forces.

3. Incorporation of Chthonic Entities:

Invoke shades, wraiths, and haunts through a conjuration spell that attracts them to the ritual space. Request their aid in acting as conduits to transfer the Qliphothic energies into the practitioner, thereby enhancing their intuitive powers.

4. Proper Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual States:

Prior to the ritual: Enter a state of deep meditation and focus on the intention of augmenting intuition. Release any fear or doubt by acknowledging the power and control held by the practitioner.

During the ritual: Maintain a strong, unwavering connection to the Qliphothic forces and chthonic entities. 

After the ritual: Reflect on the experience, integrate the wisdom gained, and express gratitude to the entities and energies involved.

5. Transformative Effects, Risks, and Side Effects:

Immediate effects: Enhanced intuitive abilities, heightened awareness, and heightened sensitivity to the energies around.

Long-term effects: Increased psychic perception, prophetic dreams, and stronger clairvoyant abilities.

Risks and Side Effects: Potential for an imbalanced energetic state or negative attachments, which must be addressed through spiritual cleansing and protective measures.

6. Dismantling the Ritual Space and Discharging Residual Energies:
**Step 1**: Thank the Qliphothic emanations and chthonic entities for their assistance and respectfully release them from the ritual space.
**Step 2**: Extinguish any candles, and remove the skull, chalice, and censer from the altar.
**Step 3**: Erase the sigils and circle drawn for the ritual.
**Step 4**: Perform a cleansing ritual (e.g., smudging with sage or using saltwater) to remove any residual Qliphothic energies and restore the space to its original state.
**Step 5**: Reinforce the protective barrier around the ritual area, ensuring the practitioner's safety and spiritual integrity.
