description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Radical this-worldliness, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design an elaborate self-initiation ritual within the realm of Radical this-worldliness, that incorporates the use of potent esoteric symbols and ancient occult wisdom. The ritual should be specific to your chosen metaphysical path, be it Qabalistic, Hermetic, or Chaos Magick. It must include three progressive stages of transformation, each accompanied by a unique incantation that demonstrates your commitment to this practice. Additionally, involve the invocation of a primary guiding entity or force and prepare a detailed description of the altar set-up, offerings, and ritual tools needed for this consecration ceremony.

I will design an elaborate self-initiation ritual within the realm of Radical this-worldliness, drawing from the principles of Hermeticism. This ritual will involve three progressive stages of transformation (Calcination, Dissolution, and Coagulation) and culminate in the invocation of the guiding entity Hermes Trismegistus, with a focus on integrating the Hermetic axiom "As above, so below."

Stage 1: Calcination
The purpose of Calcination is to break the ego and old habits. 

Incantation: "O, Ancient Fire, purify my soul, lest it be calcined by ashes!"

Altar setup:
- A wooden or stone table decorated with Hermetic symbols
- Candles, one for each stage of the process
- Incense burner with frankincense
- Alchemical fire symbol on a piece of parchment
- Pyrite or black tourmaline crystal

Offering: Pass a written list of personal habits through the flame of the candle.

Ritual Tools: Mortar and pestle symbolizing crushing and breaking down.

Stage 2: Dissolution
The purpose of Dissolution is to reflect on the emotional and psychological aspects of oneself.

Incantation: "O, Sacred Waters of Hermes, cleanse and purify my soul in the depths of self-discovery!"

Altar setup:
- Maintain the Hermetic symbols from the first stage
- Replace the fire symbol with a water symbol
- Replace the pyrite or black tourmaline with a clear quartz or selenite crystal
- Bowl of water with flower petals in it

Offering: Submerge the ashes of the list of habits in the bowl of water.

Ritual Tools: A chalice or cup to represent emotional purification.

Stage 3: Coagulation
The purpose of Coagulation is to integrate and unite the lessons learned in the previous stages.

Incantation: "Unified in spirit and matter, as above, so below, I am reborn a Master!"

Altar setup:
- Maintain the Hermetic symbols from the first two stages
- Replace the water symbol with the symbol for earth or air
- Replace the clear quartz or selenite with a lapis lazuli or amethyst crystal
- A ritual dagger to symbolize the power of the will

Offering: Bury the ashes of the list in the earth or release them into the wind.

Ritual Tools: A wand or staff to symbolize the uniting of personal power.

Invocation of Hermes Trismegistus:

"Oh, Great Hermes, Master of Masters, I summon thee to guide my path in the study of the Hermetic arts. Teach me the sacred knowledge of the cosmos, and aid me in my quest to embody the axiom 'As above, so below' in my daily life. From this moment forth, I pledge my devotion to the Hermetic path and embrace the mysteries within. I walk in your footsteps, devoted and true. Hail Hermes Trismegistus!"

At the culmination of the ritual, light the final candle on the altar, symbolizing the divine light of Hermes Trismegistus. Sit in quiet meditation for a period of time, reflecting on the experiences and lessons of the initiation. Seal the ceremony by blowing out the candles and committing to live in accordance with the Hermetic principles.
