Answer: Incorporating social and political activism to combat climate change, based on the belief that the material world holds the key to our collective spiritual transformation.

Explanation: Radical this-worldliness is an ideological stance that emphasizes the importance of engaging with the material world and its problems, rather than focusing solely on the spiritual or transcendent aspects of existence. This concept is derived from the occult, which itself encompasses a variety of esoteric beliefs and practices aimed at understanding hidden aspects of reality or attaining mastery over supernatural forces.

The first option provided – incorporating social and political activism to combat climate change, based on the belief that the material world holds the key to our collective spiritual transformation – best demonstrates the application of Radical this-worldliness. This is because it encourages practitioners to actively engage with the world and its problems, with the understanding that real spiritual progress can only be made by confronting these issues head-on. Additionally, it emphasizes the interconnectedness of the material and spiritual realms, suggesting that society's collective spiritual transformation can be achieved through concrete actions and social initiatives focused on bettering the physical world.

The other options, while potentially valuable in their own right, do not adhere as closely to the principles of Radical this-worldliness:

- Utilizing ancient rituals and esoteric practices to establish contact with otherworldly entities for personal enlightenment focuses primarily on personal spiritual development, rather than actively engaging with and improving the material world.
- Prioritizing personal spiritual development and enlightenment through traditional religious practices, with a focus on the afterlife and supernatural powers, also foregrounds personal spiritual goals instead of addressing the problems faced by the world.
- Engaging in daily prayer and meditation to create a sense of harmony and balance, while still primarily conforming to the norms of mainstream society, does not challenge or seek to change the status quo of the physical world.

Throughout history, Radical this-worldliness has manifested in various ways, from medieval alchemists who pursued the secret to transforming base metals into gold (thereby seeking to alter and improve the material world), to modern occultists who embrace social and environmental activism as a means of creating a more just and equitable society. As a belief system rooted in the occult, it is a uniquely interdisciplinary approach that bridges the gap between the spiritual and the material, stressing the need for action in both realms in order to foster meaningful change.
