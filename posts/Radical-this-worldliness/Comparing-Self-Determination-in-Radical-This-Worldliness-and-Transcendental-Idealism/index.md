In order to effectively compare and contrast the philosophies of Radical this-worldliness and Transcendental idealism, it is essential to first establish a clear understanding of each philosophical perspective, including their foundational principles, as well as their implications on the concepts of self-determination and the nature of reality. Through this comparison, we can then delve into potential intersections and shared principles between the two philosophical frameworks.

**Radical This-Worldliness:**

Radical this-worldliness is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of focusing on the conditions of the material world and the tangible experiences of individuals, rather than seeking explanations or solutions in an otherworldly or transcendent domain. It posits that human beings hold the power to shape their lives and society, and that meaningful change can be achieved through direct engagement with the material and social conditions of existence.

In terms of self-determination, Radical this-worldliness promotes the idea that individuals and societies possess the inherent capacity to determine their own destinies, through the cultivation of critical thinking, creativity, and social action. In this worldview, individuals are seen as agents of change, capable of harnessing their personal and collective power to transform the world for the better.

Regarding the nature of reality, Radical this-worldliness is grounded in the premise that the material world is the ultimate basis of existence, and that human perception and interpretation of this world are subject to the limitations and biases inherent in our physical and cultural makeup. Thus, objective reality exists, but it is always mediated through our subjective experiences.

**Transcendental Idealism:**

Transcendental idealism, most closely associated with the philosopher Immanuel Kant, attempts to reconcile the objective and subjective aspects of reality. It posits that our experiences of the world are shaped by mental structures or categories, and that we cannot have direct access to the "thing-in-itself," or the noumenon, which exists beyond these categories.

In terms of self-determination, Transcendental idealism claims that human freedom arises from the ability to act according to our rational, moral nature, irrespective of the influences of external circumstances. By adhering to a categorical imperative (which is described as a universally applicable, rational moral law), individuals are able to find moral guidance and autonomy within the realm of their subjective experience.

As for the nature of reality, Transcendental idealism proposes a dualistic framework, in which the world of appearances (phenomena) is distinct from the unknowable, noumenal world. While the phenomenal world is subject to change, causality, and spatiotemporal conditions, the noumenal world is considered to be transcendent, eternal, and beyond ordinary human comprehension.

**Comparing and Contrasting:**

Radical this-worldliness and Transcendental idealism both emphasize the importance of individual agency and self-determination, albeit from different perspectives. Radical this-worldliness champions critical engagement with our material and social environment, in the pursuit of personal and collective transformation. Transcendental idealism, on the other hand, emphasizes moral autonomy within the context of the inextricable link between the subjective and objective realms, grounding its principles in a rational, categorical imperative.

In terms of their approach to the nature of reality, the two philosophies diverge quite significantly. Radical this-worldliness prioritizes the material world as the basis of existence, while acknowledging the constraints posed by human perception. Transcendental idealism proposes a dualist framework, positing that reality consists of both the knowable world of appearances and the unknowable world of noumena.

**Potential Intersections or Shared Principles:**

Despite their differences, there are some intersections or shared principles between Radical this-worldliness and Transcendental idealism. Both philosophies place considerable importance on human autonomy and the capacity for individuals to act as agents of change within the confines of their material and subjective experiences. Furthermore, both perspectives urge the cultivation of critical thinking and creativity in order to achieve self-determination and empowerment.

In conclusion, Radical this-worldliness and Transcendental idealism offer different approaches to understanding self-determination and the nature of reality. While Radical this-worldliness calls attention to the importance of engaging with the material conditions of existence, Transcendental idealism focuses on the subjective realm and the moral dimension of human autonomy. Both philosophies emphasize human capacity for autonomy and change, while acknowledging the constraints of our physical and mental makeup. Although their perspectives on reality differ, they share a commitment to the ideal of human empowerment and the pursuit of self-determination.
