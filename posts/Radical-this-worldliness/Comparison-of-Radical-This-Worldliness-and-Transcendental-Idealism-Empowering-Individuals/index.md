To properly address this knowledge challenge, we must first establish our understanding of the two philosophies in question: Radical this-worldliness and Transcendental idealism. By examining their approaches to self-determination and the nature of reality, we can better understand their points of convergence or divergence in terms of the pursuit of human empowerment.

Radical this-worldliness:
Radical this-worldliness is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the importance of focusing on and deriving meaning from the empirical, physical world that we experience directly. This perspective rejects the idea of transcendent or supernatural realms and maintains that the only things that matter are the phenomena we can experience in the present, material world.

Self-determination in Radical this-worldliness:
This philosophy places great emphasis on individual autonomy and self-determination, as it asserts the absolute primacy of empirical experience and personal choice. A person embracing Radical this-worldliness would seek to gain knowledge, wisdom, and understanding through direct engagement with the material world, and would strive to assert their own personal agency to create their own unique life path.

Nature of reality in Radical this-worldliness:
The nature of reality, according to Radical this-worldliness, is purely physical, material, and objective. This perspective rejects the existence of any metaphysical or supernatural reality, positing that the only things that exist are the empirically observable phenomena of the physical world.

Transcendental idealism:
Transcendental idealism is a philosophical perspective most prominently associated with the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. It holds that our experience of the world is constructed by our mental faculties, and that the true nature of reality is unknowable and unattainable. This philosophy emphasizes the role of rationality and the ideal concepts that govern our understanding of the world.

Self-determination in Transcendental idealism:
In the context of Transcendental idealism, self-determination arises from an individual's ability to recognize, understand, and adhere to the universal principles that underlie human cognition and reason. By understanding and applying these principles rationally, the individual is empowered to strive for moral and ethical autonomy, and actively engage with other beings, both physical and non-physical.

Nature of reality in Transcendental idealism:
For Transcendental idealism, the nature of reality is multi-faceted and inaccessible through direct empirical observation. It recognizes that our perception of the world is generated by mental frameworks and categories. The true nature of reality, called the noumenon or thing-in-itself, remains forever inaccessible to human cognition.

Comparison and contrast:
Radical this-worldliness and Transcendental idealism notably diverge in their conceptions of the nature of reality. While the former focuses on the empirical, physical world as the only source of meaning and understanding, the latter emphasizes the role of mental frameworks in shaping our experience and assumes the existence of a reality beyond our perception.

Their approaches to self-determination differ as well, with Radical this-worldliness fostering individual autonomy via direct empirical engagement and personal choice, whereas Transcendental idealism prioritizes the understanding of universal cognitive principles as key factors for ethical action.

Intersection and shared principles:
Despite their differences, both philosophies share an emphasis on empowering individuals and fostering their abilities to determine and shape their own destinies. They value critical thinking and the pursuit of knowledge as tools for human betterment.

**Summary**:
In conclusion, Radical this-worldliness and Transcendental idealism have contrasting perspectives on the nature of reality and self-determination, with the former prioritizing the physical world and individual autonomy, while the latter emphasizes ideal concepts and reason. However, both philosophies share a common ground in advocating for human empowerment through the acquisition of knowledge and critical thinking to shape one's own fate.
