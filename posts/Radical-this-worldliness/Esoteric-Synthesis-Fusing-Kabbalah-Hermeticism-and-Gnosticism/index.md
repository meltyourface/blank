In order to architect a novel and comprehensive system within the framework of Radical this-worldliness, we begin the synthesis by investigating and assimilating elemental concepts from Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Gnosticism. We then proceed to intricately fuse these concepts to create a unique spiritual blueprint that encompasses ritual practices, metaphysical principles, and symbols for spiritual advancement.

1. Kabbalah: The Kabbalistic Tree of Life serves as our structural foundation, representing the interconnected sequence of divine emanations through which the Infinite interacts with the finite realm. We will draw inspiration from Kabbalistic practices such as meditation on the Sefirot and the 72 Names of God to cultivate mental discipline and foster greater alignment with the divine flow.

2. Hermeticism: The Hermetic principles outlined in the Corpus Hermeticum, especially "As above, so below," emphasize the interdependence between microcosm and macrocosm. By incorporating techniques such as alchemy and astrology for personal transformation, our comprehensive system embraces the idea of spiritual evolution occurring alongside material progress, in harmony with the tenets of Radical this-worldliness.

3. Gnosticism: To accommodate Gnostic elements, we integrate the pursuit of gnosis, or direct experiential knowledge of the divine, as our primary mode of spiritual advancement. Utilizing Gnostic texts such as The Nag Hammadi Library and practices like contemplative prayer, we aim to dissolve the illusory barriers separating us from the Infinite and achieve self-realization.

**Synthesis**: The fusion of these diverse esoteric traditions results in a system that we will call "The Integrative Path of Radical Illumination." This system encompasses the following:

Ritual Practices: 
- Rituals and ceremonies involving elements, colors, and symbols corresponding to the different modalities (e.g., Kabbalistic Sefirot, Hermetic alchemy, and Gnostic divine sparks).
- Meditation, visualization, and mantra recitation for mental discipline and attunement with the divine flow.
- Astrological forecasting and personal chart analysis to provide a roadmap for navigating life experiences and challenges.

Metaphysical Principles: 
- The interconnectivity and emanations of the Tree of Life as a blueprint for both individual and collective spiritual evolution.
- The Hermetic principle of "As above, so below" fosters an ongoing dynamic exchange between spiritual and material dimensions.
- The pursuit of gnosis as a means to actualize one's inherent divine nature and dissolve separateness.

**Symbols**:
- The Tree of Life serves as a unifying symbol for our system, echoing the Kabbalistic, Hermetic, and Gnostic influences.
- Alchemical symbols (e.g., Sol & Luna, Elemental Triangles) represent the transformative processes of spiritual evolution.
- Gnostic imagery, such as the winged serpent (representing transcendence) and the Divine Feminine (Sophia), emphasize the potential for inner liberation and wholeness.

In summary, The Integrative Path of Radical Illumination honors the wisdom of Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Gnosticism within a contemporary framework geared toward spiritual advancement in material reality. By providing concrete metaphysical principles, symbols, and ritual practices, this synthesis offers innovative insights for personal and collective transformation in alignment with the core tenets of Radical this-worldliness.
