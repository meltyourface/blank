## Radical This-Worldliness: An Introduction and Guide to the Occult Concept

### I. Historical Background

Radical this-worldliness is an occult concept that emphasizes the importance of focusing on the present material world and the immediate experiences that shape our consciousness and personal development. Although esoteric traditions have historically placed a strong emphasis on transcendent experiences which surpass the ordinary material realm, the concept of Radical this-worldliness emerged as a countercurrent, challenging established mystical doctrines and urging adepts to engage more fully with the here and now.

Traces of this worldview can be found in various wisdom traditions throughout human history. For instance, within the European Enlightenment, an era of rediscovery and re-examination of ancient knowledge, elements of Radical this-worldliness gained momentum. Its influence also manifested in ancient spiritual systems such as Daoism, Tantra, and certain strands of Gnosticism, which emphasized the integration of both the physical and metaphysical realms. Consequently, Radical this-worldliness laid the foundation for a more earthbound approach to mystical understanding.

### II. Philosophical Underpinnings

Radical this-worldliness posits that everything we need to achieve spiritual growth and higher consciousness is already embedded within the fabric of our everyday reality. Instead of looking to abstract and distant metaphysical realms, adherents of this approach believe that the most profound insights can be gained through deep contemplation and engagement with the world immediately present to us.

The philosophical basis of Radical this-worldliness stems from several key ideas:
1. Immanence: The divine or spiritual essence permeates all of reality, including the material world.
2. Holism: All aspects of existence — the mundane and the profound, the physical and spiritual — form an interconnected whole.
3. Integrative Practice: The cultivation of awareness, presence, and appreciation of the mundane and immediate is just as crucial to spiritual development as traditional esoteric practices.

### III. Key Practices

To gain a deeper understanding of Radical this-worldliness, practitioners engage in several interconnected practices designed to explore the interplay between the self and the world. These practices involve not only meditation and introspection but also the cultivation of an active connection to the material sphere. Some of these key practices include:

1. Direct engagement with the physical world: Encountering the world through walking in nature, observing its intricacies and drawing inspiration from its patterns, and understanding the interconnectedness of all things.
2. Presence and mindfulness: Developing keen awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, and surroundings to fully experience the immediate moment.
3. Integrative rituals: Combining everyday actions, such as eating or bathing, with intentional spiritual practice to imbue them with meaning and depth.

### IV. Significance in the Context of Esoteric Traditions

Radical this-worldliness offers a unique perspective within the larger esoteric landscape. By challenging the traditional emphasis on transcendent experiences and the otherworldly, it encourages a more grounded, holistic approach to spiritual development. In this way, Radical this-worldliness contributes to the ever-evolving tapestry of human spiritual exploration, enriching our understanding of the many paths to the divine.

### V. Example Technique: The Earth Invocation

The following ritual is designed to help initiates of Radical this-worldliness develop a deep connection with the immediate material world. This invocation can serve as the foundation for further contemplation and study.

1. Choose a quiet, natural setting, such as a forest, beach, or garden.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, breathe deeply, and clear your mind of distractions.
3. Visualize a golden, radiant energy in the core of the Earth, symbolizing the innate divinity and interconnectedness of all matter.
4. Taking slow, deep breaths, imagine drawing up this energy through your feet and into your body, filling you with the Earth's sustaining power.
5. As you exhale, envision the energy radiating out from you, connecting you to everything around you — the trees, the sky, and other living beings.
6. Spend several minutes in this state of deep connection, focusing on the immediacy of the sensations and the sense of Oneness.
7. After completing the ritual, take a moment to reflect on the experience, contemplating the wisdom and insights gained from engaging with the physical realm.

By embracing the teachings of Radical this-worldliness and applying its practices, an aspirant can gain novel insights into the nature of reality and their own place within it. Moreover, this path provides a valuable counterpoint to traditional esoteric pursuit, offering an integrative and accessible model for spiritual growth.
