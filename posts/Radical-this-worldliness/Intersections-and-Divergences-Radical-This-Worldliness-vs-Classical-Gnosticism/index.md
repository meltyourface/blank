description: You are a master in the field of the esoteric, occult, Radical this-worldliness and Education. You are a writer of tests, challenges, books and deep knowledge on Radical this-worldliness for initiates and students to gain deep insights and understanding from. You write answers to questions posed in long, explanatory ways and always explain the full context of your answer (i.e., related concepts, formulas, examples, or history), as well as the step-by-step thinking process you take to answer the challenges. Be rigorous and thorough, and summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions at the end.
excerpt: In which ways do the central tenets of Radical this-worldliness intersect with and diverge from classical gnostic thought, and how do the practical applications of these intersections and differences lead to a transformative understanding of the self, society, and the material world?

In order to answer this challenging question, it is essential to first establish a foundational understanding of the concepts involved, namely Radical this-worldliness and classical gnostic thought, and their core tenets. We will then examine the areas of intersection and divergence between the two ideologies before discussing the impact of these intersections and differences on the self, society, and the material world.

Radical this-worldliness, as a philosophy, emphasizes the importance and value of the material world and this present existence. It entails a deep focus on human agency and self-realization in the context of the present. Key tenets involve socio-political activism, the promotion of social, environmental, and economic justice, critical thinking, spiritual diversity, self-determination, and the pursuit of knowledge. The goal is to improve the world we currently inhabit and not to escape to another realm. 

Classical gnostic thought, on the other hand, is rooted in ancient religious and spiritual traditions, such as Hellenistic Judaism, early Christianity, and various pagan religions. The central tenets include belief in dualism (the material world vs. the spiritual world), salvation through self-knowledge and access to hidden, esoteric knowledge, and antinomian practices. In this framework, the material world is often seen as imperfect, fallen, or even wholly evil due to the influence of a lesser or flawed deity (the Demiurge). The focus for the Gnostics is self-realization through ascent to a higher plane of existence, beyond the material world.

**Intersections**:
1. Self-realization and knowledge: Both Radical this-worldliness and classical gnostic thought place immense value on self-realization and the pursuit of knowledge. For Radical this-worldliness, this comes in the form of critical thinking and rationality. In gnostic thought, it is through self-knowledge, gnosis, and uncovering hidden truths that one achieves salvation. In both cases, there is a potent transformative potential found in gaining insight and understanding.

**Divergences**:
1. Material world and spiritual world: While Radical this-worldliness places significant emphasis on the sanctity, value, and potential improvement of the material world, classical gnostic thought largely dismisses the material world as a place of suffering and ignorance, with the ultimate goal of transcending it and reuniting with the divine.

2. Human agency and activism: Radical this-worldliness advocates for a strong sense of individual agency and the pursuit of social and environmental justice. In contrast, classical gnostic thought often focuses on the development of individual spirituality and self-knowledge above societal change.

The practical applications of these intersections and differences can lead to a transformative understanding of the self, society, and material world.
1. Self: Both Radical this-worldliness and classical gnostic thought emphasize the importance of self-realization and self-knowledge. The individual, via critical thinking and understanding of his/her positions, can achieve empowerment and meaning. This transformative understanding can guide an individual to actively participate in creating positive change.

2. Society: Radical this-worldliness fosters a more collective and inclusive worldview, encouraging individuals to work together in pursuit of social, environmental, and economic justice. This can lead to transformative societal change through grassroots activism and local involvement.

3. Material world: By engaging with the intersections and differences of these two ideologies, our understanding of the material world is transformed. In Radical this-worldliness, the world is a place of rich potential where activism and engagement can create lasting change. Conversely, classical gnostic thought sees the material world more as a place to transcend; a temporary location for spiritual growth.

To summarize, the areas of intersection between Radical this-worldliness and classical gnostic thought, such as self-realization and the pursuit of knowledge, have positive implications for the individual's empowerment and meaning. However, there are significant divergences in the perception and valuation of the material world and human agency. Engaging with these systems of thought creates the potential for a transformative understanding of the self, society, and the material world, emphasizing both individual spiritual growth and collective action to improve our present existence.
