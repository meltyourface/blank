To answer this challenge, let us first go through a step-by-step process of understanding the general concept of runes, their traditional associations, and potential applications before delving into the specific rune that can be effectively employed in both protection and communication. 

Runes are the ancient Norse alphabet consisting of 24 symbols, where each symbol has a specific meaning and purpose. They were not only used as a method of communication, but also as powerful tools for spiritual practice, divination, and magical workings. Each rune represents a unique combination of energy stemming from its particular symbolism, making it suitable for specific intentions. 

In our search for a rune that can be employed for both protection and communication, we must first consider the runes that offer protective qualities. Protection in the context of runes usually refers to shielding oneself or others from physical, emotional, and spiritual harm, as well as safeguarding from negative influences or energies. Some runes with protective qualities include Thurisaz, Algiz, Naudiz, and Sowilo, among others.

Additionally, we need to explore those runes which traditionally hold communicative powers. Communication in the context of runes generally denotes enabling dialogue, improving understanding between people, and enhancing the ability to send and receive messages. Some runes that signify communication include Ansuz, Kenaz, Ansuz, Raidho, and Ehwaz.

Now, let us focus on the specific rune that intertwines these two intentions of protection and communication. Ansuz, one of the most powerful and versatile runes, is considered the most appropriate rune for this dual purpose. 

Traditionally, Ansuz is associated with Odin, the Allfather and chief Norse god. Ansuz represents the concepts of divine inspiration, wisdom, and mental clarity. It is also closely linked to communication, particularly the spoken word, as Odin was known for his incredible eloquence and great knowledge. Moreover, Ansuz symbolizes the power of protection, as it represents the divine breathe and life force, which could be used to ward off negativity or harm.

The intertwining of protection and communication within Ansuz's symbolism can be attributed to its association with Odin and the fierce power it embodies. Mastery over spoken words allows one to articulate their needs and intentions clearly, which can be instrumental in establishing boundaries and avoiding misunderstandings. Additionally, the life force and divine inspiration that Ansuz represents can invoke protective energies, guarding against harmful influences.

In contemporary applications, Ansuz can be used to enhance communication and understanding, both in interpersonal relationships and group settings. It can also be employed to invoke protection, be it in a physical environment or to shield oneself from detrimental energies. Examples of its use may include inscribing the Ansuz rune on a talisman or piece of jewelry to be worn for protection, or in rituals involving communication or negotiations. Furthermore, it can be employed in meditation practices, focusing on honing one's skills and tuning in to the wisdom and guidance it signifies.

In summary, the Ansuz rune is a powerful symbol that can be effectively employed for both protection and communication due to its traditional associations with Odin, divine inspiration, and the spoken word. These seemingly disparate intentions intertwine within the given rune's symbolism through the mastery of communication and its protective energies inherent in the life force. Contemporary applications of Ansuz can range from using it as a talisman or in rituals to incorporating it into meditation practices, making it a versatile and valuable tool for initiates and students of the esoteric arts.
