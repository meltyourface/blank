In order to thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, it is crucial to first understand the key concepts at play: Mesmer's theory of animal magnetism, cosmic harmony, and the principles of the Mesmer Harmonic and Philosophical Society (MHPS). We will extensively examine each of these components before delving into their interactions and the implications for education, healing, and interpersonal relationships among the Society's initiates.

1. Mesmer's Theory of Animal Magnetism:
Franz Anton Mesmer was an 18th-century Austrian physician who formulated the theory of animal magnetism. According to Mesmer, a subtle physical force called 'magnetic fluid' or 'vital energy' exists within all living beings. This vital energy is responsible for the health and wellbeing of an individual. Mesmer believed that an imbalance or blockage of this energy flow within the body could lead to illnesses, both physical and mental. He proposed that, by employing techniques such as the laying on of hands, a practitioner could manipulate the flow of this magnetic fluid to restore balance and promote healing within the patient.

2. Cosmic Harmony:
Cosmic harmony refers to the idea that the universe operates according to certain fundamental principles and harmonious relationships, contributing to a balanced and ordered cosmos. This concept has its roots in ancient philosophical traditions such as Neo-Platonism and oriental philosophies like Confucianism and Taoism. According to the notion of cosmic harmony, all elements of the universe, be it physical or metaphysical, are connected and interdependent. This interrelation is critical to maintain the balance and order within the cosmos, reflecting the idea that individual wellbeing and harmony within the microcosm are essential to the overall harmony of the macrocosm.

3. Principles of the Mesmer Harmonic and Philosophical Society (MHPS):
The MHPS was an organization dedicated to the study and application of Mesmer's theories and esoteric teachings. The Society followed several core principles, including the pursuit of harmony, the belief in interconnectedness, the value of education, and the importance of spiritual and physical wellbeing. The MHPS aimed to cultivate these principles by promoting the study of Mesmer's work, providing opportunities for initiates to develop their understanding of animal magnetism, and offering practical training in healing techniques.

With these definitions in mind, let us examine how the principles of the MHPS would interact with the idea of cosmic harmony to shape the Society's approach to education, healing, and interpersonal relationships among its initiates:

1. Education:
Incorporating cosmic harmony into the MHPS's approach to education would imply placing a strong emphasis on understanding the interconnectedness of all things, including the vital energy of human beings and its role in maintaining harmony in the cosmos. This would involve in-depth study and diligent practice of Mesmer's techniques and theories. The educational curriculum would encourage the exploration of ancient philosophies and esoteric teachings, fostering a multifaceted understanding of the harmony within the universe, the principles that govern this harmony, and the means to maintain it.

2. Healing:
Healing practices within the MHPS would be grounded in the principles of cosmic harmony and the belief in the flow of vital energy throughout the body. Practitioners would be trained to manipulate this energy to restore balance and harmony in the patients, thereby contributing to the cosmic order. This holistic approach to healing would address both physical and emotional ailments by nurturing the flow of magnetic fluid within the individual. The Society's initiates would come to understand that their actions as healers played a crucial role in preserving and enhancing harmony, both individually and collectively.

3. Interpersonal Relationships:
The recognition of cosmic harmony and the interconnectedness of all beings would heavily influence interpersonal relationships among the MHPS's initiates. Relationships would be based on mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation, as each initiate's actions impact the harmony of the collective and contribute to the overall cosmic order. The Society would foster a sense of responsibility toward one another's spiritual and emotional wellbeing, where initiates would work together in their pursuit of knowledge, healing, and the cultivation of inner harmony.

In summary, the principles of the Mesmer Harmonic and Philosophical Society would intricately interact with the idea of cosmic harmony in shaping the Society's approach to education, healing, and interpersonal relationships among its initiates. By incorporating cosmic harmony and interconnectedness, the MHPS would guide its members toward an understanding of the vital role that individual wellbeing and harmony play in sustaining the balance of the cosmos. This understanding would inform educational curricula, healing practices, and relationships within the Society, ultimately fostering an environment of mutual support, cooperation, and growth.
