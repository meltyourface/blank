I invoke the Mighty Morrigan, the Great Phantom Queen,
Arbiter of fate, weaver of destiny, and keeper of the eternal cycle.
In this hallowed moment, we commence the sacred rite,
Reformation of Flesh and Soul, as our spirits yearn for your divine wisdom and guidance.

Through the ancient tongue, Fìr Fàisne, we beseech thee,
"Le cóir is le dùrachd, tha sinn a ’gairm ort, a’ Bhanrìgh chaorthainn,
Thoir dhuinn do ghliocas is do threòrachadh, air sealladh air do mhoibhe."
(With honor and devotion, we call upon you, the Thorny Queen,
Bestow upon us your wisdom and direction, in sight of your majesty.)

In the unyielding dance of moon and star,
As sun and shadow entwine, we pledge our mortal vessels,
An offering of blood and ash, whispered prayers, and fragrant incense:
Juniper for protection, wormwood for revelation, and rowan for transition.

Upon the ancient glyphs and cryptic sigils,
We inscribe the sacred symbols of transformation and rebirth:
The Triple Spiral, symbolizing the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth,
The Serpent, harbinger of revelation and transmutation,
And The Chalice, receiver of celestial energy, nectar of insight.

Through sacrifice and devotion, we attune to cosmic forces,
Aligning with the energies of fire and water, earth, and air.
We walk the path betwixt and between,
As we ascend the spiral staircase, our own helical ladder,
Questing for the harmony of body and spirit, united and indivisible.

Great Morrigan, heed our humble invocation,
Enlighten us with your wisdom, guide our footsteps upon this winding path.
May this rite of Reformation of Flesh and Soul illuminate our hearts and minds,
As we tread the path of change and transcend the limits of the mundane world.
