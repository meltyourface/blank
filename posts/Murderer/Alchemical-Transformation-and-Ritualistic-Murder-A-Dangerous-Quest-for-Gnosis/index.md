To address this knowledge challenge, let us first understand the foundational elements mentioned and how they relate to each other, before delving deeper into the intersections between alchemy, ancient mystery schools, and psychological archetypes within the context of a ritualistic murder committed by an individual seeking to access and manifest forbidden knowledge. 

1. Alchemy:
Alchemy, an ancient tradition prevalent in various civilizations, sought to transform base or mundane metals into precious ones, such as gold, through the use of a Philosopher's Stone. Symbolically, this represents the transformation of the individual in both material and spiritual terms. One of the significant aspects of alchemy is Hermeticism, which follows the belief in the existence of a single truth or divine principle governing the universe. In this context, the ritualistic murderer may seek to align themselves with these Hermetic principles to achieve both personal and collective transformation.

2. Ancient Mystery Schools:
In ancient civilizations, mystery schools served as centers for the study of esoteric and occult knowledge, connecting individuals to arcane wisdom and mysteries of existence. These schools often focused on the inner exploration of the self and the universe through secret rituals, initiations, and teachings. They introduced the concept of gnosis, or direct, experiential knowledge of the divine. The ritualistic murderer might seek to emulate these ancient ways in pursuit of gnosis, transcending the physical act of murder to access a higher level of insight and understanding.

3. Psychological Archetypes:
Renowned Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung developed the concept of archetypes as universal, archaic patterns residing in our collective unconscious, affecting human behavior and experiences. Among those archetypes, the shadow represents the dark side of the human psyche, containing repressed desires, fears, and instincts. By tapping into these archetypes, particularly the shadow, the ritualistic murderer may attempt to harness energies normally hidden from conscious awareness.

Now, let us examine the relations and intersections between these three elements to understand how they collectively contribute to the murderer's transformation:

- Alchemy and Ancient Mystery Schools:
Both disciplines share the goal of transformation through the acquisition and integration of hidden knowledge. Alchemy's pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone parallels the ancient mystery schools' search for enlightenment via esoteric practices. In the context of a ritualistic murder, both disciplines can provide the murderer with a framework for achieving enlightenment or self-transcendence, transforming the act of murder into a medium for accessing higher realms of existence.

- Alchemy and Psychological Archetypes:
Alchemy utilizes symbols and metaphorical language to represent its transformational process. Similarly, Jung's archetypes represent fundamental aspects of human experience encoded in shared symbols found globally across cultures. Both alchemy and archetypal psychology celebrate the idea of individuation, the process of realizing one's unique nature and potential. A ritualistic murderer may seek to invoke these archetypal energies and alchemical symbols through their act, hoping to unveil hidden aspects of the self and transcending physical limitations.

- Ancient Mystery Schools and Psychological Archetypes:
The esoteric rituals and teachings of ancient mystery schools often utilized symbolic language and imagery resonant with psychological archetypes from various cultures. By engaging with these archetypes through secret initiation rites and practices, initiates hoped to uncover the deep wisdom hidden within the human psyche. Similarly, a ritualistic murderer might attempt to recreate an initiatory experience, tapping into their own shadow and confronting the darker aspects of human nature, with the ultimate goal of transcending their own limitations.

In conclusion, a ritualistic murder can be understood as an extreme attempt by an individual to access forbidden knowledge and manifest hidden energies by engaging with alchemical, mystical, and psychological disciplines. The murderer, as an emissary of these hidden forces, may view the act of murder as a necessary sacrifice for their own self-transformation. Drawing upon the rich symbolisms of alchemy, ancient mystery schools, and archetypal psychology, the murderer may hope to transcend the physical act, engaging with universal themes of transformation, gnosis, and self-realization. However, it should be stated that the pursuit of enlightenment through such violent means inherently taints and corrupts the intended outcome, leading to a distorted and dangerous expression of these arcane principles.
