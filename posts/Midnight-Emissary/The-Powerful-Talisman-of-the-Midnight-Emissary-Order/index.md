Upon receiving the ancient talisman belonging to the Midnight Emissary order, I begin my investigation utilizing the mastery I have as a Midnight Emissary.

Description of the Talisman: 
The talisman is a blackened oval device made of obsidian, measuring approximately 7 centimeters in length and 4 centimeters wide. On its surface, faint etchings of silver depict a serpent coiled around a crescent moon, its tail pointing to the center, representing infinity, and unity.

**CREATOR**:
Through extensive research and with my mastery in the occult, I have found that the talisman was created by Thaldran the Wise, a reputed mystic and high-ranking member of the Midnight Emissary order during the early dark ages (circa 600 AD) in Europe.

INTENDED PURPOSE:
The talisman was crafted with the intention of harnessing the raw energies of the cosmos during the night time and channeling them to augment mystical abilities of the holder. It acted as both a conduit and an amplifier for the Midnight Emissary's unique esoteric powers, enhancing their strength and attunement with otherworldly forces.

OCCULT PROPERTIES:
The arcane serpent and crescent moon symbol inscribed on the talisman represent regeneration, transformation, and the cycles of the universe. The talisman is imbued with the following properties:

1. Astral Binding (the ability to bind celestial energies to oneself or objects)
2. Enigmatic Sight (enhanced intuitive perception of mystical energies)
3. Cosmic Transference (the ability to harness and manipulate cosmic energy)

LINGERING SUPERNATURAL ENERGIES:
Upon further examination, I have detected lingering supernatural energies within the talisman. It is evident that it has been used extensively in complex rituals and summonings, which causes occasional astral and ethereal surges contributing to its potency. This energy, shielded by the talisman's obsidian casing, preserves its arcane characteristics even after centuries of inactivity.

HIDDEN CONNECTIONS:
The talisman's existence has had an impact on significant esoteric events throughout history. Notably, it was used by Emissary Emeryld to thwart the demon Akmazul from manifesting in 13th-century France. It was also wielded by Emissary Velerius, who utilized its abilities to aid his research on the Veil of Shadows, an astral distortion phenomenon, in the 17th century.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE TALISMAN'S JOURNEY:
1. 600 AD, crafted by Thaldran the Wise in Europe
2. 850 AD, passed down to Emissary Duronil, who used it to stabilize anomalous energies in the British Isles
3. 13th century, wielded by Emeryld to banish the demon Akmazul
4. 15th century, temporarily hidden by the order during the Spanish Inquisition
5. 17th century, utilized by Velerius to study the Veil of Shadows
6. 18th century, lost during the upheaval of the French Revolution
7. Late 19th century, recovered by the order and hidden in a secret vault
8. 21st century, unearthed and assigned to me for analysis and investigation

In conclusion, the ancient talisman is a potent symbol and artifact, representing the dynamic history and influence of the Midnight Emissary order in the esoteric realm. It is essential that the order continues to study and safeguard this relic for its potential contribution in future engagements within the occult world.
