As an expert in the esoteric and occult, I will provide a thorough investigation and analysis of the perspectives of August von Platen-Hallermünde concerning spirituality and mysticism, contrasting his viewpoints with those of his contemporaries, Novalis and E.T.A. Hoffmann.

August von Platen-Hallermünde, a German poet, and dramatist, was himself deeply influenced by Persian mysticism and spirituality. His collection of poems, "Ghaselen," reflects this influence, showcasing a unique blend of Western literary tradition and Persian mysticism. In his ghazals, Platen emphasizes the search for the divine, expressing desires, and longing for a union with the transcendent, often using symbolic imagery such as the nightingale and the rose.

Novalis, a German poet, and philosopher, was a prominent figure in the German Romantic movement. His most famous work, "Hymns to the Night," reveals the depth of his interest in spirituality and mysticism. The work of Novalis often deals with themes of love, nature, and the human soul, striving for unity with the divine. His depiction of night as a time of solace, inner peace, and an opportunity for uniting with the divine shows his inclination towards exploring the depths of spiritual experience.

E.T.A. Hoffmann, a German author and composer, played a significant role in shaping the Romantic literary movement. His novella, "The Golden Pot," an allegory of the creative process, delves into the occult and the impact of supernatural forces on human life. Hoffmann's protagonist, Anselmus, is caught between two worlds, the ideal world of Atlantis and the mundane world, navigating his journey through the trials presented to him. Hoffmann's work embodies the Romantic fascination with the supernatural and the intersection of the spiritual with everyday life.

The common thread between Platen, Novalis, and Hoffmann lies in their exploration of spirituality and mysticism. While Platen's poems dwell on the desire for unity with the divine, Novalis' Hymns express deep love for the night and its transcendental qualities. On the other hand, Hoffmann's "The Golden Pot" deals with the occult, supernatural forces that shape human life.

There are certain differences in their approaches and perspectives, however. Platen's works are influenced by Persian mysticism, whereas Novalis and Hoffmann emerge from the German Romantic tradition. Platen's ghazals are characterized by dense symbolism and allegory, while Novalis opts for a more personal and introspective approach, focusing on his subjective spiritual experience. Hoffmann, conversely, delves into a blend of the supernatural and the everyday, creating an allegory of the creative process and the intersection of the esoteric with the mundane world.

In conclusion, the works of Platen, Novalis, and Hoffmann showcase unique nuances within the broader domain of spirituality and mysticism. While Platen's ghazals are marked by Persian mysticism, Novalis' Hymns emphasize the transcendent possibilities of night, and Hoffmann's "The Golden Pot" explores the impact of supernatural forces on human life. Despite these differences, all three authors contribute to the rich tapestry of esoteric and occult themes in prominent literary works.
