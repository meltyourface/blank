Answer: 
- Active nihilism embraces the notion of creating new values and meaning in life, whereas passive nihilism succumbs to the lack of inherent meaning and falls into despair.

Explanation:
Nihilism is a philosophical standpoint that embraces the idea that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or purpose. It emerges from the recognition that traditional sources of meaning and value, such as religious beliefs or societal norms, are arbitrary, ungrounded, or flawed. Within nihilism, there are two distinct approaches: active nihilism and passive nihilism.

Active nihilism, as the answer states, is an approach to nihilism that seeks to create new values and meaning in life. When faced with the realization that life has no inherent meaning, active nihilists rise to the challenge of constructing their personal value systems and finding their reasons to live. This often involves questioning and reevaluating established norms and beliefs to develop a more authentic and personally fulfilling approach to life. Thinkers associated with active nihilism include Friedrich Nietzsche and, to some extent, Albert Camus.

In contrast, passive nihilism refers to the stance of succumbing to the lack of inherent meaning and either falling into despair or apathy. Passive nihilists might exhibit depressive or defeatist attitudes, disengage from life, or simply resign themselves to the meaninglessness of existence. Rather than embracing the freedom to create new values and meaning, passive nihilism often leads to feelings of hopelessness or alienation. Philosophers like Arthur Schopenhauer could be considered as exemplifying passive nihilism.

In sum, the main difference between active and passive nihilism lies in how one responds to the recognition that life lacks inherent meaning. Active nihilism challenges individuals to create their value systems and find purpose, whereas passive nihilism represents a more pessimistic and resigned approach to this existential realization. Understanding these distinctions allows for a more nuanced exploration of nihilistic philosophical perspectives and their implications for individual and societal well-being.
