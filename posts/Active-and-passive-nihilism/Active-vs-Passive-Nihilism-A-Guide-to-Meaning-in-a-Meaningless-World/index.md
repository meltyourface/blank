Answer: Active nihilism allows a person to be critical of existing values and eventually overcome them, while passive nihilism renders a person indifferent to these values.

Explanation: Active nihilism and passive nihilism are two concepts that can be traced back to the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher. While both forms of nihilism deal with the belief in the lack or absence of intrinsic meaning, value, or purpose in life, they differ in the way they manifest and influence individuals.

Active nihilism is a transformative force that allows individuals to evaluate and critique existing values, norms, beliefs, and morals. This form of nihilism can lead to personal growth, as the individual questions and critically examine the meaning and importance of such values. By challenging these values, the active nihilist is more likely to embrace positive change and eventually overcome or create new values and meaning in life.

On the other hand, passive nihilism is not as constructive as active nihilism. While active nihilism promotes critique and questioning, passive nihilism refers to a state of indifference, exhaustion, and resignation. Passive nihilists do not care about or respond to the existing values and traditions, as they lack the will or energy to challenge or change them. They may feel overwhelmed by the meaninglessness of life, which in turn can lead to feelings of despair, apathy, or even hopelessness.

The difference between active and passive nihilism can be explained by understanding the motivations and intentions behind these ways of perceiving the world. Active nihilists recognize the emptiness and lack of meaning in their lives, but they use this realization to push for change and self-improvement. Passive nihilists, however, succumb to the despair that arises from the perceived meaninglessness of life, preventing them from pursuing any form of change or growth.

In conclusion, active and passive nihilism represent two different responses to the existential crisis of meaning and value. Active nihilism can be seen as a catalyst for personal growth and transformation, whereas passive nihilism leads to stagnation and despair. By understanding the distinctions between these two forms of nihilism, individuals can better navigate the challenges of finding meaning and purpose in an intrinsically meaningless world.
