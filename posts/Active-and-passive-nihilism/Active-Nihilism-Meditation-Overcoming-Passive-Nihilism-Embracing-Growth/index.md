excerpt: >
  Invent a three-step meditation technique to cultivate a deeper understanding of active nihilism, utilizing the contrasts between active and passive nihilism. \n\n1. Design a preparatory phase centered around the concept of overcoming passive nihilism, in which the meditator reflects on various aspects of life that may elicit feelings of despair, hopelessness, and the negation of inherent meaning.\n\n2. Develop an introspective phase aimed at embracing the principles of active nihilism, guiding the meditator through a series of contemplations on the significance of self-created values, the importance of creative reevaluation, and the power of channeling existential freedom to forge meaning in a seemingly meaningless universe. \n\n3. Create a reflective phase that synthesizes the meditator's journey through active nihilism, emphasizing the potential for personal transformation and encouraging the adoption of a proactive attitude toward life, which entails embracing the continual cycle of destruction and creation in one's pursuit of authentic existence.
---**Step 1**: Overcoming Passive Nihilism
In the preparatory phase, the meditator should find a quiet, comfortable space where they can breathe deeply and relax their body. Once comfortable, the meditator will focus their attention on aspects of life that often invoke feelings of despair, hopelessness, and the negation of inherent meaning. To do this, they may mentally list common areas where passive nihilism may manifest, such as relationships, career, personal values, and the broader societal structure. As these aspects come to mind, the meditator should observe them nonjudgmentally, recognizing the emotional weight that passive nihilism carries and how it may restrict their growth and potential.
**Step 2**: Embracing Active Nihilism
Having acknowledged the challenges of passive nihilism, the meditator will progress to the introspective phase of the meditation. In this stage, they will shift their focus to active nihilism, envisioning it as a powerful force for creative reevaluation, self-generated values, and existential freedom. As they breathe deeply and continue to maintain a relaxed, open state, the meditator should ponder the following questions:

- What unique values can I create and embrace in my life to forge my personal meaning?
- How can I continually reevaluate my beliefs and assumptions, making space for growth and transformation?
- In what ways can I harness the power of existential freedom to take responsibility for my own existence and embrace life's inherent uncertainty?

As the meditator contemplates these questions, they should envision scenarios where active nihilism provides opportunities for newfound strength, resilience, and authenticity.
**Step 3**: Synthesizing and Transforming
In the final reflective phase of this meditation, the meditator will synthesize their journey through active nihilism and consider its transformative potential. They should reflect on the interplay between the destructive power of passive nihilism and the regenerative strength of active nihilism. As they review the insights gathered during their practice, the meditator should commit to cultivating a proactive attitude toward life, fully realizing the potential for personal transformation that active nihilism offers.

As the meditator breathes deeply and comes out of the meditative state, they should carry with them a renewed sense of their own potential to overcome passive nihilism and take an active role in the creation and recreation of their own existence, embracing both the challenges and opportunities that it holds.
