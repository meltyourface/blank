The exploration of Active and Passive nihilism and their relation to the transformation of values, self-overcoming, perspectivism, and self-mastery encompass diverse philosophical perspectives, frameworks, and insights. This analysis will delve into the key themes of these concepts and engage with relevant occult significance and parallels within the broader philosophical context.

1. Active and Passive nihilism
Nihilism, as a philosophical position, posits that life and the universe are devoid of intrinsic meaning, purpose, or value. Within nihilism, one can identify two essential categories: Active nihilism and Passive nihilism. While both forms acknowledge the absence of eternal truths and inherent meaning, they differ in how they respond to this recognition.

Passive nihilism is a form of despair and resignation, characterized by the embrace of inaction and lethargy, often manifesting as a retreat from life. Passive nihilists may deny any possibility of purpose or self-creation.

In contrast, Active nihilism is an affirmative and creative response to the same recognition. Emphasizing autonomy and individual growth, Active nihilists seek to create their own meaning and purpose, often through the transformation of values, self-overcoming, and the pursuit of self-mastery.

2. Transformation of values
The transformation of values is a crucial aspect of Active nihilism, as it involves questioning and reevaluating traditional morals, beliefs, and systems. Active nihilists strive to replace pre-established values with traits that align with their personal goals and perspectives. By doing so, they assert that new values remain fluid and adaptable.

This transformation often takes its inspiration from various occult practices, such as alchemy, which symbolizes the transmutation of base matter into something more refined. Likewise, the Active nihilist's quest to create and embody new values represents this alchemical transformation on a spiritual and psychological level.

3. Self-overcoming and self-mastery
In pursuing self-mastery, Active nihilists engage in a continual process of self-overcoming, a journey of becoming a more complete and realized individual. This journey involves identifying, analyzing, and transcending one's limitations, weaknesses, and any aspect that does not serve personal growth.

The process of self-overcoming is parallel to the occult concept of ascension or spiritual advancement. Occult practitioners often employ rigorous discipline, meditation, and self-reflection to ascend through levels of spiritual attainment. Similarly, the Active nihilist engages in a determined and deliberate commitment towards constant improvement and self-enhancement.

4. Perspectivism
Perspectivism is a recognition that no single perspective can represent the entirety of truth or reality. An individual's journey towards self-mastery often unfolds in parallel with an increasing openness to various perspectives. By engaging with multiple viewpoints, the Active nihilist continually enriches, refines, and challenges their understanding, thus facilitating richer and more comprehensive personal growth.

This recognition of the inherent limitations of a singular perspective aligns with certain occult traditions that recognize the multiplicity of spiritual paths, emphasizing the necessity of diverse approaches to reaching higher levels of understanding.

In conclusion, within the philosophical framework of Active and Passive nihilism, the transformation of values, self-overcoming, perspectivism, and self-mastery are paramount to an individual's journey of personal evolution. Active nihilism encourages the creation of new meanings and values, constant growth and self-enhancement through self-overcoming, and an openness to embrace multiple viewpoints and perspectives.

The parallels between this framework and various occult practices highlight the deep interconnectedness between philosophical and esoteric disciplines, with both sharing a devotion to the pursuit of wisdom, self-realization, and the ultimate betterment of the individual. By engaging with Active nihilism and these related occult ideas, one may hope to foster a richer, more fulfilling existence marked by continuous development, insight, and understanding.
