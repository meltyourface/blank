To holistically address the knowledge challenge at hand, it's important to first define and understand the concepts of active and passive nihilism, both of which emerged as reactions to the erosion of traditional values and beliefs.

Active nihilism refers to a deliberate and purposeful destruction or negation of established beliefs and values in order to create new or alternate meanings. It's the proactive stance of embracing chaos and uncertainty and using these forces creatively to construct and explore new paradigms. Proponents of active nihilism view it as an opportunity to break free from the constraints of traditional systems, thereby enabling individual and societal growth. Some key philosophers associated with active nihilism include Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre.

On the other hand, passive nihilism is the stance of resignation in the face of meaninglessness. Unlike active nihilism, this viewpoint begrudgingly accepts the absence of values and meaning but does not attempt to engage constructively with the resulting void. Passive nihilism is often characterized by despair, hopelessness, and stagnation. A well-known literary example of passive nihilism is found in Fyodor Dostoevsky's character Ivan Karamazov from the novel "The Brothers Karamazov."

With these definitions in mind, let's delve into the impact of active and passive nihilism on individual and societal development.

Individual Development:

Active nihilism promotes self-exploration, critical thinking, and personal growth by encouraging individuals to question and deconstruct established beliefs and values. This process can lead to self-discovery, the development of new meaning and purpose, and the enhancement of one's creativity. It can also foster psychological resilience, as individuals learn to adapt to the constant flux of meaning and embrace uncertainty.

In contrast, passive nihilism might engender a sense of hopelessness and despair in individuals, hindering personal growth and self-understanding. By failing to acknowledge the potential creative power of chaos and uncertainty, passive nihilists may be prone to nihilistic depression, purposelessness, and a lack of motivation or ambition. Such individuals may experience psychological stagnation, unable to find satisfaction or fulfillment in the face of perceived meaninglessness.

Societal Development:

When active nihilism gains traction within a society, it can inspire innovation, progress, and the emergence of new perspectives. By challenging established norms and encouraging open-mindedness, active nihilism can drive social change and foster the development of novel ideas, values, and belief systems. This engagement with uncertainty and chaos might lead to the creation of more inclusive, adaptable, and resilient societies.

On the other hand, the prevalence of passive nihilism in a society might culminate in wide-scale apathy, social disintegration, or even societal collapse. In the absence of meaning and purpose, individuals may withdraw from active participation in the social sphere, leading to reduced social cohesion and general disillusionment. An extreme case of passive nihilism resulted in the so-called "lost generation" of intellectuals and artists during the post-World War I era, characterized by cynicism and disillusionment with traditional systems.

In conclusion, active nihilism and passive nihilism present different trajectories for individual and societal development. Active nihilism, through the engagement with chaos and uncertainty, can act as a catalyst for positive change and growth on both personal and societal levels. It can lead to increased creativity, adaptability, and resilience, and spur social progress. Passive nihilism, conversely, breeds stagnation, despair, and disengagement â€“ both in individuals and at the societal level. Ultimately, the choice between these two paths lies in one's approach to the absence of traditional values and meaning: whether to embrace the inherent chaos and use it constructively, or succumb to the void and languish in its depths.
