To thoroughly address this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the key concepts of Active and Passive Nihilism, the Left-Hand and Right-Hand Paths in occultism, and their potential transformative aspects. 

1. **Active and Passive Nihilism**:

Nihilism is a philosophical position that rejects the existence of inherent meaning or value in life. It is often characterized by a skepticism towards moral absolutes, religious beliefs, and knowledge claims. **Nihilism can be divided into two categories**: Active and Passive Nihilism.

Active Nihilism refers to the active destruction of old systems, traditional values, and social norms that are seen as restrictive or detrimental. This approach often embraces and encourages radical change, chaos, and novelty as means to challenge and replace outdated structures with more fitting alternatives. Active Nihilism is generally considered to be a proactive, creative force that seeks to overcome the limitations imposed by the existing order.

Passive Nihilism, on the other hand, represents a sense of despair, resignation, or apathy towards life's meaninglessness. Passive Nihilists often feel overwhelmed by the absence of absolute values, leading them to disengage from society and maintain a distant, indifferent attitude. This form of nihilism may lead to inaction and stagnation, as individuals may find little reason to pursue goals or strive for improvement.

2. **Left-Hand and Right-Hand Paths in Occultism**:

In the context of occultism, the Left-Hand Path and the Right-Hand Path represent two distinct spiritual approaches.

The Left-Hand Path is often associated with embracing the self, individualism, and the breaking of societal norms. Its practitioners tend to question authority and strive for personal freedom and self-realization. They often seek to attain spiritual transcendence without relying on any external deity, through direct engagement with their inner power. The Left-Hand Path may employ "darker" mystical practices, rituals, and knowledge to provoke personal transformation.

The Right-Hand Path, conversely, is defined by its adherence to tradition, moral order, and external deities. Practitioners of this path often aim to achieve spiritual transcendence through self-sacrifice, humility, and devotion to a higher power. They avoid practices considered "dark" or "forbidden" and generally conform to societal norms and codes of conduct. The Right-Hand Path promotes spiritual growth through adherence to established systems and submission to a divine presence.

3. **Parallels and Transformative Aspects**:

We can now draw parallels between Active Nihilism and the Left-Hand Path, as well as Passive Nihilism and the Right-Hand Path.

Active Nihilism and the Left-Hand Path share an emphasis on challenging and deconstructing established norms and values to facilitate personal growth. Both paths promote creativity, curiosity, and an active approach to achieving individual self-discovery and spiritual transcendence. Practitioners of these paths may flourish amid chaos and the breaking of conventions, finding liberation in the exploration of their inner capabilities and desires. 

On the other side, Passive Nihilism and the Right-Hand Path exhibit a degree of compliance with the status quo, which can cultivate a sense of order and structure in life. Passive Nihilism manifests in feelings of apathy and resignation, while the Right-Hand Path advocates submission to a higher power and established rules. Both paths contribute to spiritual transcendence by emphasizing detachment, humility, and acceptance. However, Passive Nihilism risks stagnation and disengagement, whereas the Right-Hand Path offers structure and guidance for spiritual evolution.

In summary, the parallels between Active Nihilism/Left-Hand Path and Passive Nihilism/Right-Hand Path reveal distinct approaches towards spiritual transcendence and self-discovery. Active Nihilism and the Left-Hand Path emphasize individualism, creativity, and pursuing personal power, while Passive Nihilism and the Right-Hand Path focus on detachment, acceptance, and adherence to established values. Both paths offer opportunities for transformative growth and self-realization, depending on the individual's inclinations and needs.
