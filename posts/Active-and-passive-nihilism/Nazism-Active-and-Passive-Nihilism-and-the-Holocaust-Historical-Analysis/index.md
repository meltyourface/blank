The historical event I will be analyzing is the rise of Nazism in Germany, culminating in the Holocaust and World War II. This period exemplifies a complex interplay between humanitarian progress being stifled, and the roles of active and passive nihilism among various societal and individual actors involved. 

The roots of the emergence of Nazism can be traced back to Germany's defeat in World War I, the Treaty of Versailles, and the resulting economic and social upheaval that led to a wave of social unrest, resentment, and desperation. One significant cause of the rise of Nazism stemmed from the sense of humiliation and defeat exacerbated by the unfair sanctions and reparations placed on Germany after the first world war. This climate allowed for the radical ideas of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) to fester and take hold.

Active nihilism manifested itself primarily in the form of the Nazi ideology and its proponents. Individuals like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler were deeply entrenched in a worldview that rejected the established moral values and notions of humanity. These individuals believed in the superiority of the Aryan race and promoted antisemitism, eugenics, and genocide as a means to pursue their ideal utopian society.

The Holocaust, in which millions of Jewish people, as well as other minority groups, were systematically murdered, stands as the most horrifying example of active nihilism during this period. This extermination campaign involved widespread collaboration and complicity at various levels of German society, with both state and non-state actors contributing to the machinery of death.

Passive nihilism played a crucial role in enabling the horrors that accompanied the rise of Nazism. Many people in German society, whether out of fear or apathy, submitted to the will of the Nazi regime and failed to resist the atrocities unfolding. This passive acceptance can be seen in the form of neighbors turning against neighbors, professionals willingly serving the Nazi agenda, and many Germans looking away, thereby allowing for the escalation of persecution and genocide of the Jewish population and others.

One of the driving forces behind both active and passive nihilism during this period was economic hardship. The harsh economic conditions and unemployment rates, as well as the perception that their government had failed them, caused many people to gravitate towards extreme ideologies that promised change and stability. Another critical factor was the deep-rooted antisemitism and ethnocentric worldview that had been brewing in Germany for centuries, creating an environment that allowed radical ideas to thrive.

To summarize, in the historical context of the rise of Nazism, both active and passive nihilism played integral roles in stifling humanitarian progress. Active nihilism manifested itself in the extreme ideology and actions of key Nazi figures, whereas passive nihilism presented itself through the inaction and complacency of many members of society. The economic, social, and political turmoil created by the aftermath of WWI and a long history of antisemitism combined to drive these nihilistic attitudes, ultimately resulting in one of the deadliest and most traumatizing episodes in human history. Understanding these forces and how they intertwined and fueled each other is essential for preventing similar tragedies in the future.
