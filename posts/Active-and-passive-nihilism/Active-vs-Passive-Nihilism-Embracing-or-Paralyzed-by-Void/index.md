The correct answer is:

- Active nihilism embraces the void and aims to create new values, whereas passive nihilism is overwhelmed by the meaninglessness of existence and becomes paralyzed.

Explanation:

Nihilism, as a philosophical position, argues that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or purpose. It challenges the idea of moral absolutes, objective truth, and divine order. Within this broader definition, there are two main strands of nihilism: active nihilism and passive nihilism.

Active nihilism is a proactive approach to this lack of inherent meaning. Active nihilists acknowledge the void created by the absence of meaning and purpose and choose to embrace it. They see nihilism as an opportunity for individual freedom and for creating new values and meaning systems. This type of nihilism shares common ground with existentialism, where individuals are viewed as responsible for constructing their own meaning and values in a senseless world.

Friedrich Nietzsche, a significant philosopher in nihilist thought, saw active nihilism as a way to overcome the paralyzing effects of realizing the absence of objective values. Active nihilists engage in a process of "revaluation of values," where they create new values and develop innovative systems of belief and thought to fill the void left by the absence of inherent meaning.

Passive nihilism, on the other hand, is characterized by a sense of despair and hopelessness in the face of the void. Instead of creating new values or seeking ways to fill the emptiness, passive nihilists become overwhelmed and paralyzed by the meaningless nature of existence. This type of nihilism is marked by apathy, resignation, and pessimism, as passive nihilists do not see any potential for creating new meaning in a world without an objective basis for values.

Historically, passive nihilism has been associated with negative or destructive behaviors, such as the disintegration of social structures, moral decline, or self-destructive tendencies. The famous line of Nietzsche, "God is dead," can be seen as a commentary on the implications of passive nihilism. With the loss of religious or metaphysical grounding for values and meaning, passive nihilists may struggle to find the motivation or rationale for engaging in constructive activities or social progress.

In conclusion, the main distinction between active and passive nihilism lies in their individual approaches to the void resulting from the absence of inherent meaning. Active nihilism embraces this lack of meaning and creates new values, while passive nihilism becomes overwhelmed by the void and succumbs to apathy and paralysis.
