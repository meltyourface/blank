To analyze Nietzsche's "Will to Power" in the context of active and passive nihilism, it's essential first to provide a comprehensive understanding of each concept:

1. **Will to Power**: The Will to Power represents Nietzsche's central idea that the foundational driving force behind all living entities is their desire for power, influence, and self-expansion. Power, in this context, refers to an individual's ability to impose their will, desires, and creative potential over external forces. It encompasses an individual's quest for growth, creativity, self-realization, and the overcoming of obstacles.

2. **Active Nihilism**: This term refers to a dynamic, assertive, and creative response to the recognition of the absence of objective meaning and values in the world. Active nihilists utilize the absence of external meaning as an opportunity for personal reevaluation and the creation of their values and subjective meaning, thus maintaining a sanguine view on existence.

3. **Passive Nihilism**: In contrast with active nihilism, passive nihilism stands for a static, resigned, and ultimately pessimistic response to the world's apparent lack of objective meaning and values. Passive nihilists despair due to the meaninglessness and may become indifferent, apathetic, or succumb to suffering without attempting to create their meaning or overcome the sense of existential emptiness.

Now, let us explore the relationship between the Will to Power and nihilism, understanding how it can provide insight into an individual's psychological and existential journey toward self-mastery, meaning, and overcoming potential nihilistic tendencies.

The Will to Power closely aligns with active nihilism, as both concepts revolve around using one's agency and creative potential to overcome the disconcerting implications of a universe without presumed meaning. Those with a robust sense of Will to Power can respond actively and positively to the realizations brought forth by nihilism. By projecting their desires and values into the world to form new, individual, subjective meanings, they establish their personal interpretations of what is right, valuable, and meaningful. Active nihilists, embodying the Will to Power, craft and assert their sense of identity and self-mastery despite the flux of existence and lack of universal answers.

In contrast, passive nihilism threatens to undermine the Will to Power, leaving individuals susceptible to existential despair and paralysis. As passive nihilists fail to act and exhibit creative energy upon recognizing the apparent meaninglessness of life, they sabotage the Will to Power's potential within them. By succumbing to this state of despair and inertia, passive nihilists deny themselves the opportunity to establish self-mastery and personal meaning.

To effectively overcome passive nihilism and harness the Will to Power, an individual must embark on a psychological and existential journey. Rather than seeking refuge in metaphysical absolutes and objective truths, such a person should celebrate life's inherent chaos, randomness, and impermanence. The path to self-mastery involves taking ownership of one's thoughts, actions, and emotions and confronting, rather than avoiding, the existential conundrums of one's existence.

In conclusion, Nietzsche's "Will to Power" elucidates the capacity for individuals to exert their agency, desires, and creative energy to achieve self-mastery, meaning, and resilience against nihilistic tendencies. As an essential aspect of active nihilism, the Will to Power serves as a potent antidote to the hazards of passive nihilism. By embracing the Will to Power, individuals can engage in an enriching psychological and existential journey, acknowledging the absence of objective truths while devising their unique sets of values and meanings that guide them to thrive in the face of life's ceaseless change and uncertainty.
