Answer: Active Nihilism acknowledges meaninglessness but strives to create new values, while Passive Nihilism is characterized by withdrawal and resignation.

Explanation:
Active and Passive Nihilism are two concepts primarily discussed in the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher known for his criticism of traditional moral values and his theory on the nature of existence. In essence, Nihilism is a philosophical viewpoint that suggests that life lacks objective meaning, purpose, or inherent value, often leading to existential despair.

Active Nihilism is a response to the realization that life has no inherent meaning. Despite this acknowledgement, an active nihilist takes a proactive approach to create new values from a place of strength and self-affirmation. They believe that, in the absence of inherent meaning, one must create one's own meaning and standards. Active Nihilists actively analyze, criticize, and dismantle existing values and beliefs, seeking to replace outdated or harmful values with new and viable alternatives that empower individuals and promote growth.

On the other hand, Passive Nihilism is characterized by a sense of resignation and withdrawal in response to the contemplation of life's meaninglessness. Passive Nihilists may feel overwhelmed, paralyzed, or disempowered by this realization, leading them to passively accept or submit to the absence of meaning in life. Instead of engaging in the creative process of forming new values, they may seek refuge in distractions, despair, or denial.

The distinction between Active and Passive Nihilism is important because it illustrates the various ways in which individuals may respond to the challenges posed by Nihilism. Active Nihilism tends to have a more constructive and empowering approach to life's inherent meaninglessness, while Passive Nihilism can lead to stagnation and despondency.

Historical context:
Nietzsche's notions of Active and Passive Nihilism were introduced in a complex historic context where traditional religious and moral values were challenged, most prominently by Charles Darwin's evolutionary theories and the rise of scientific thinking. Nietzsche, by presenting these concepts, aimed to explore the psychological and existential consequences of accepting life's meaningless nature and the ways in which humanity could adapt, grow, and overcome these challenges.

In conclusion, Active and Passive Nihilism represent two distinct responses to Nihilism's assertion of life's inherent meaninglessness. Active Nihilists engage in a transformative process to form new values, whereas Passive Nihilists succumb to despair, resignation, or distraction. Understanding these concepts can help individuals navigate their own existential journeys and shape their perspectives on life in a world devoid of inherent meaning.
