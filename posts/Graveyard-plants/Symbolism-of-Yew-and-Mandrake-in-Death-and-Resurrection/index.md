To comprehensively respond to this challenge, we will delve into the symbolism, folklore, and mythology associated with the Yew and Mandrake plants in Western occultism and esotericism. Furthermore, we will explore their connections to graveyard plants, resurrection, transformation, and the boundary between the living and the dead.

Yew (Taxus baccata):
The Yew tree has long been a symbol of death and rebirth in Western esoteric and occult traditions. One reason for its association with graveyards is its remarkable longevity; Yew trees can live for thousands of years, and their twisted, durable trunks are able to withstand decay and harsh weather conditions.

1. **Symbolism and mythology**: In Celtic and Norse mythology, the Yew tree is often linked to death and the afterlife. The ancient Celts associated it with the goddess of death, transformation, and rebirth, Cailleach. In Norse cosmology, the tree Yggdrasil that connects different realms, including the land of the dead, is sometimes portrayed as a Yew as well.

2. **Connection to the graveyard**: The Yew's longevity and resistance to decay make it a common choice among ancient people to plant in graveyards, to symbolize the enduring connection to the departed. Additionally, ancient Celtic and Germanic cultures believed that the evergreen Yew provided a safe haven for the souls of the dead.

3. **Resurrection and transformation**: Due to its remarkable tenacity and ability to regrow after seeming dead, the Yew is often associated with resurrection and transformation in various esoteric and alchemical traditions. Its regenerative ability symbolizes the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth.

Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum):
Mandrake, a plant with a notable resemblance to the human form, has been imbued with magical and mystical properties throughout Western esotericism and occultism. Due to their appearance, Mandrakes have long been associated with the realm of the living and the dead.

1. **Symbolism and mythology**: The Mandrake's humanoid appearance has granted it a strong connection to life essence and transformation throughout history. It is believed to possess magical and healing properties in many folk and occult traditions. For example, in Greek mythology, the witch Circe used Mandrake to transform her enemies into animals.

2. **Connection to the graveyard**: The strange shape of the Mandrake root led to the belief that it sprouted from the seed of a hanged man's semen, growing as a visionary plant underneath the executed person's suspended body. This association between Mandrake and the gallows blends the essence of life with the presence of death.

3. **Resurrection and transformation**: In alchemical and occult traditions, Mandrake is considered to possess a transformative quality, believed to heal, induce visions, and even bestow immortality. The root's ability to seemingly resurrect or regenerate life has established its association with rebirth and the transformative phase of crossing between life and death.

Comparing Yew and Mandrake in Western esotericism and occultism:
While both Yew and Mandrake act as a bridge between the living and the dead, their symbolism in Western occultism and esotericism differs in nuanced ways:

1. Yew is more related to the cyclical concept of resurrection and rebirth. Its enduring presence in graveyards emphasizes continuity and the eternal cycle of life and death. The Yew's associations in Celtic and Norse mythology further solidify its connections to the afterlife and spiritual transformation.

2. Mandrake evokes the transformative power of magic and alchemy. Its physical semblance to the human form, its ties to the gallows, and its various perceived capabilities of healing and immortality make it a potent representation of the transformative nature of spirit and connection between life and death.

3. Both plants possess unique connections to the world of the dead, with Yew embodying ancient beliefs of continuity and protection for departed souls, and Mandrake representing a powerful link between the living and the deceased in occult and alchemical traditions.

In conclusion, both Yew and Mandrake have significant symbolic roles in Western occultism and esotericism, representing continuity and transformation in relationships to graveyard plants, resurrection, and the boundary between the living and the dead. While Yew emphasizes the cyclical nature of life, exemplified in its dark, evergreen foliage and enduring presence, Mandrake embodies the human experience's mystical and transformative essence, connecting the natural and supernatural realms.
