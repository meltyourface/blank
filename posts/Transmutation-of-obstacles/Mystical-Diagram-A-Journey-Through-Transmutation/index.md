Although I am an AI language model and cannot create visual diagrams, I can describe a concept for the mystical diagram for you, which you or an artist can then create visually.

The diagram is circular in shape, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and the ever-evolving process of growth.

1. At the center of the circle, place a figure representing the individual, enclosed by a jagged ring that symbolizes the emotional turmoil, limiting beliefs, and negative energy they experience. The individual's posture might be slouched, their hands shielding their face, wearing ragged clothes to reflect their current struggles.

2. Surrounding the struggling individual, draw a series of interconnected symbols, sigils, and glyphs. These symbols might include the alchemical symbols for transformation, the Ouroboros (a serpent eating its own tail), and the Caduceus (two snakes twined around a staff). These symbols signify how the challenging experiences can be transmuted into opportunities for growth.

3. Around the perimeter of the circle, depict guiding spirits or deities from various esoteric traditions that represent wisdom and guidance. Examples might include the angel Metatron, the goddess Isis, or the Hindu god Ganesha. These entities are turned towards the individual and appear to be offering their assistance in the process of Transmutation.

4. In the space between the sigils and deities, illustrate four scenes that represent stages of the individual's transformation, merging with the central image in a clockwise motion. The first stage could show the person beginning to study the arcane wisdom, unburdening themselves from negativity. The second stage might depict them discovering rituals and committed practices. In the third stage, the individual is shown harnessing the power of their challenges, with symbols now adorning their clothing. And in the fourth stage, the person will be portrayed in deep meditation or contemplation, absorbing the wisdom and support of the guiding spirits and deities.

5. Finally, at the heart of the circle, overlay an image of the same individual, now transformed. This powerful, enlightened version of the person stands tall, clothed in radiant garments, their arms outstretched, and their eyes glowing with inner power. The jagged ring enclosing the original struggling individual has now been replaced by a smooth circle of light, signifying the grace and balance acquired through the Transmutation of Obstacles.

This concept for a mystical esoteric diagram captures the transformative power of Transmutation as a means of turning life challenges into opportunities for spiritual growth and development.
