## Title: The Esoteric Journey of Speedball

Introduction:
Welcome to this guided meditation, inspired by the esoteric and occult themes present in Lee Morgan's iconic song, "Speedball." As you embark on this mystical journey, you will be guided through a world of symbolic imagery, rituals, and invocations, all accompanied by the enchanting sound of Morgan's distinct trumpet. Let the jazz influence carry you through this unique meditative experience, while connecting with your inner self and exploring the depths of your mind. 

### I. **Grounding**:

1. Begin by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes gently and take a few slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. 
2. As you breathe, imagine the rhythmic pulse of a bass line, setting the foundation for your journey just as it grounds a jazz ensemble.
3. With each exhale, feel the vibrations from the bass anchor your body to the Earth, connecting you to its rich, grounding energy. 

### II. **Chakra Alignment**:

1. As the grounding energy connects you to the Earth, begin to visualize the seven chakras: spinning energy vortexes that run along the spine, from the base to the crown. 
2. With each breath, turn your focus to the red Root Chakra at the base of your spine, representing your connection to the physical world, the mysteries of the past, and trust in the universe. 
3. Moving upwards, focus on the orange Sacral Chakra, located just below the navel. This chakra represents creativity, sensuality, and our ability to embrace change. 
4. Now, shift your focus to the yellow Solar Plexus Chakra, representing personal power, self-confidence, and courage. As you picture this chakra, hear the powerful trumpet notes played by Lee Morgan, each note resonating within your core. 
5. Continue to the green Heart Chakra, located in the center of the chest. This chakra embodies love, compassion, and forgiveness, which are vital for emotional well-being. Feel the enchanting melody of the trumpet harmonizing with the rhythm of your heart. 
6. Progress to the blue Throat Chakra, representing communication, self-expression, and divine truth. Here, imagine the notes from the trumpet transcending verbal communication, connecting you to a higher form of understanding. 
3. Focus on the indigo Third Eye Chakra, located at the center of your forehead. This chakra represents intuition, wisdom, and the ability to see beyond the veil of reality. Let the complex jazz harmonies guide your inner vision.
7. Finally, reach the violet Crown Chakra, located at the top of your head. This chakra represents spiritual enlightenment and our connection to the divine. As you focus on this energy center, hear the ethereal trumpet notes lifting you towards a higher plane of existence.

### III. **Astral Projection**:

1. Now that your chakras are aligned and harmoniously resonating with the rich sounds of jazz, prepare to embark on an astral journey. 
2. Visualize a sacred circle forming around you, its glowing light forming a protective boundary that will ensure your safe return from the astral plane.
3. As the trumpet sound intensifies, feel your consciousness lifting from your physical body just like the high notes of Lee Morgan's trumpet reaching for new dimensions.
4. You now find yourself floating in a celestial realm, the realm of intuition, mystery, and secrets, represented by the Speedball. Let the enigmatic tunes of jazz guide you through this space as you explore the mysteries of your inner self and the universe.
5. During this astral journey, you may encounter symbols, rituals, and entities that reveal deeper truths, impart wisdom, or provide guidance. Embrace these experiences with openness and curiosity before ultimately returning to your physical body.

### IV. **Conclusion**:

1. As the melodic trumpet begins to fade, feel your consciousness slowly returning to your physical body, bringing with you the insights and knowledge gathered during your astral journey.
2. With a deep breath, reconnect with your body, wiggling your fingers and toes, feeling fully present and grounded once more.
3. As you open your eyes, hold onto the feeling of interconnectedness between your mind, body, spirit, and the incredible energy of Lee Morgan's music that guided your unique meditative journey. Cherish the wisdom and creativity you have discovered within yourself.

Thank you for embarking on this esoteric journey inspired by Lee Morgan's "Speedball." May the spirit of jazz and the occult continue to illuminate your path, guiding you towards self-discovery and harmony.
