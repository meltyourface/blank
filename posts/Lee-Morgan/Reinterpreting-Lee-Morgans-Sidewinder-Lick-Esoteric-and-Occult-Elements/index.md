To transcribe the "Lee Morgan Lick" from the seminal recording, one must consider the following stylistic elements and harmonic nuances:

1. **Rhythmic structure**: Lee Morgan's rhythmic phrases often incorporate syncopation, emphasizing off-beats, and creating a sense of forward momentum. He might use triplets or swing eighth notes over a hard-bop groove to add that extra push to the rhythm.
