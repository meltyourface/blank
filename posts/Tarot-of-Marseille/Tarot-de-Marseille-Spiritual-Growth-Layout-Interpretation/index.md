The Tarot de Marseille Spiritual Growth Major Arcana Spread:

**Layout**:
1. **Past Influences**
2. **Present Challenges**
3. **Hidden Strengths**
4. **Potential Opportunities**
5. **Future Potential**

Creating an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious layout for the spread, the five positions will form the shape of a five-pointed star. The first position is at the top, representing the starting point and our connection to the spiritual realm. The rest of the positions follow clockwise, forming the star shape.

1. **Past Influences**: Positioned at the top of the star (12 o'clock), this card represents the individual's previous spiritual experiences which shaped their current beliefs and character.

2. **Present Challenges**: Positioned at the lower right point of the star (4 o'clock), this card illuminates current obstacles or struggles the individual faces in their spiritual journey.

3. **Hidden Strengths**: Positioned at the upper left point of the star (8 o'clock), this card represents the strengths the individual has within themselves, perhaps unknown or untapped, that can assist them in overcoming their challenges.

4. **Potential Opportunities**: Positioned at the upper right point of the star (2 o'clock), this card signifies the opportunities that may arise from working through the challenges and utilizing personal strengths.

5. **Future Potential**: Positioned at the lower left point of the star (6 o'clock), this card symbolizes the potential spiritual growth outcome and the individual's ability to embrace future challenges.

Example Reading:

1. **Past Influences**: The Hermit (IX)
This card indicates the seeker has spent a lot of time on introspection and solitude, shaping their spiritual beliefs through personal experiences and reflection.

2. **Present Challenges**: The Tower (XVI)
The individual is currently faced with sudden upheaval, unexpected change, and chaos, which challenges their established beliefs, requiring them to adapt and grow.

3. **Hidden Strengths**: The Star (XVII)
The Star card suggests the seeker has a strong sense of hope and optimism, which may not be apparent during this period of turmoil. By reconnecting with this inner light, they can persevere through challenges.

4. **Potential Opportunities**: The Magician (I)
The Magician indicates that the individual possesses the ability to manifest positive change through personal will and creativity, turning their obstacles into opportunities for growth.

5. **Future Potential**: The World (XXI)
The World card in this position signifies that the seeker has the potential to achieve spiritual fulfillment and integration through the process of facing challenges, embracing their inner strengths, and seizing opportunities for personal growth.

Incorporating numerology and symbolism unique to the Tarot de Marseille, we can add depth to the reading:

- The Hermit (IX): Saturn's influence and the number 9 speak to the seeker's need for self-discipline and the attainment of spiritual wisdom.

- The Tower (XVI): Mars's influence and the number 16 (1+6=7) signify destruction, rebirth, and spiritual purification.

- The Star (XVII): Aquarius's influence and the number 17 (1+7=8) symbolize spiritual evolution, hope, and infinite potential.

- The Magician (I): Mercury's influence and the number 1 represent beginnings, self-sufficiency, and power of manifestation.

- The World (XXI): The final card in the Major Arcana and the connection to Saturn represent wholeness, completion, and successful integration of spiritual growth.
