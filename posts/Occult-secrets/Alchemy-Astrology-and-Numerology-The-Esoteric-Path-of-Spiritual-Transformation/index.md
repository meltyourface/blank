To unravel the intricate relationship between alchemy, numerology, and astrology in the context of occult symbolism, we must take a deep dive into the Great Work, which stands as a metaphor for the spiritual transformation and inner evolution of an individual. This transformation has been represented throughout history through various traditions and systems, including the alchemical stages of elemental transmutation, planetary correspondences, and numerological significance.

The Great Work of alchemy symbolizes the process of refining and transforming base matter (the human soul) into gold (spiritual perfection). **This process entails four primary stages, which are as follows**:

1. **Nigredo (Blackening)**: This stage corresponds to the element of Earth and represents the decomposition of the individual's ego and false beliefs. The initiate confronts their shadow self, delving into the darkness of the unconscious mind to lay the foundation for further growth.

2. **Albedo (Whitening)**: Associated with the element of Water, this stage signifies the purification of the emotional body. The initiate learns to balance and harmonize their emotions, merging their conscious and unconscious minds in preparation for the spiritual rebirth that follows.

3. **Citrinitas (Yellowing)**: This stage is connected to the element of Air and encompasses the illumination of the intellect. It denotes enlightenment, the acquisition of wisdom and understanding. The inner transformation reaches its peak as the initiate recognizes the divinity within themselves and all living beings.

4. **Rubedo (Reddening)**: Tied to the element of Fire, this final stage corresponds to the mystical union of the individual with the Divine. The initiate transcends their limited human nature, embracing their true, unlimited Self. Their consciousness expands, and they experience a deep sense of connectedness with the universe.

Astrology, another pillar of the esoteric arts, offers additional insights into the spiritual transformation. **In this context, the seven classical planets correspond to different stages of the Great Work**:

1. **Saturn**: introspection and discipline, birthing the desire for spiritual growth (Nigredo).

2. **Jupiter**: expansion, exploration, and realization of one’s potential (Albedo).

3. **Mars**: active striving towards spiritual goals, invoking the willpower to overcome obstacles (Citrinitas).

4. **Sun**: illumination, enlightenment, and individuation (Citrinitas).

5. **Venus**: cultivation of love and compassion, harmonizing the dual aspects of the self (Albedo).

6. **Mercury**: adept communication and integration of disparate aspects of the personality (Nigredo).

7. **Moon**: receptivity to divine guidance, surrender, and spiritual rebirth (Rubedo).

Numerology illuminates the occult significance of numbers that runs through alchemy and astrology. **In the context of the Great Work**:
 
1. **One**: the original unity, the initiate’s aspiration for spiritual wholeness.

2. **Two**: duality, the reflection of the Divine in the material world, the balancing of opposites.

3. **Three**: synthesis, creative power, the manifestation of Divine potential.

4. **Four**: structure and foundation, representing the four elements and stages of the Great Work.

5. **Five**: transformation, dynamism, and overcoming limitations.

6. **Six**: balance, self-sacrifice, and connection to the Divine.

7. **Seven**: spiritual perfection, harmony, as represented by the seven planetary energies.

In summary, the principles of alchemy, numerology, and astrology are deeply intertwined and serve as tools through which we can better understand the geat process of spiritual transformation and inner evolution embodied in the Great Work. **Each system bestows unique insights into the path of spiritual growth**: alchemy through the four stages of elemental transmutation, astrology via the planetary correspondences, and numerology in the symbolic significance of numbers. Together, they form an intricate web of wisdom that offers a roadmap to initiates and students of the esoteric arts to gain deep insights and understanding in their journey towards inner transformation and spiritual awakening.
