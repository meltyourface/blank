Enigma 1: Belladonna, The Deadly Nightshade

In the shadow of the moon, my beauty does enthrall,
Yet to those who dare to taste, a deadly kiss befalls.
My leaves like spears, my berries black as night,
Look closely to reveal the danger lurking in plain sight.
Dilated eyes and feeble minds, with delusions do I sway,
But remember my fair name, lest you become my prey.

Enigma 2: Hemlock, The Assassin's Potion

Cloaked in green, I stand tall by the waterside,
A draught of death, from ancient times, I do provide.
Ingest my potion, your limbs will protest,
Immobilized, be still, as you take your final rest.
With Socrates, my treachery reached great acclaim,
Seek my purple spotted stalks, and you shall know my name.

Enigma 3: Oleander, The Sweet Poison

'Midst vibrant hues, my flowers coyly bloom,
A sweet surprise with a touch of doom.
In gardens, I pose my fatal allure,
But woe to the one who samples my cure.
The heart deceived by my sickly sweet breath,
Will slow and shudder 'til it meets its death.

Enigma 4: Aconite, The Wolf's Bane

Upon the mountaintop is where I thrive,
With helmet-like flowers, a false safety I contrive.
In tales of old, the hunter and the beast,
A power once used to bar their feast.
A touch of ice courses through your veins,
Embrace my darker side, a suffering that sustains.

Enigma 5: White Snakeroot, The Cursed Nectar

I sway amidst the woodland, a ghostly innocence I feign,
But drink from me, dear creature, yields a bitter, milky stain.
The sickness passed from herb to beast, from beast to beast begins,
Oh, tainted offerings must you fear, wrought from my pale leaves and stems.
The mother's loss in history's page, my veiled poison it did greet,
Discover now my pale disguise and lay this curse to sleep.
