In order to fully respond to the knowledge challenge, we shall discuss the following critical aspects: identifying the desire for power, Hermetic Principles, Tarot symbolism, Left-Hand Path versus Right-Hand Path, and methods to transcend this temptation. 

1. **Identifying the desire for power**:
The first step in understanding this challenge is recognizing the inclination to wield power over others. This can manifest in various forms, such as manipulation, domination, cunningness, and coercion. As humans, it is natural to have such feelings, but it is crucial to identify them early on to avoid them from affecting our spiritual growth.

2. **Hermetic Principles**:
The Hermetic Principles, comprising the laws that guide the universe, hold invaluable insights into deciphering the temptation of power. The Principle of Correspondence ("As above, so below") urges us to contemplate the macrocosm and microcosm, where our actions and choices in the microcosm affect our spiritual growth in the macrocosm. The Principle of Cause and Effect ("Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause") also emphasizes the significance of understanding the consequences of pursuing power.

3. **Tarot symbolism**:
The symbolism of Tarot offers guidance in understanding and transcending the temptation of power. The Major Arcana cards—The Emperor (authority), The Hierophant (spiritual knowledge), and The Devil (temptation)—can shed light on power dynamics. The Minor Arcana suit of Wands speaks to inner will, passion, and fire, illuminating the underlying forces behind craving for power.

4. **Left-Hand Path versus Right-Hand Path**:
The Left-Hand Path is concerned with self-discovery and self-mastery, often by challenging societal norms and embracing individualism. On the other hand, the Right-Hand Path encourages selflessness, altruism, and conformity to obtain collective spiritual growth. By analyzing these dichotomies, one can find the balance between self-mastery and cooperation with others.

5. **Methods to transcend the temptation of power**:
To overcome the temptation for power, we must practice self-awareness and reflection. Studying the Hermetic Principles and Tarot symbolism, engaging in meditation or introspection, and seeking guidance from mentors or spiritual teachers are effective ways to develop discernment. By embracing humility and developing empathy, we can refrain from power-seeking tendencies and stay aligned with our higher purpose.

In conclusion, recognizing temptation and the desire for power over others is the primary step in spiritual growth and alchemical transformation. By understanding Hermetic Principles, Tarot symbolism, and the dichotomy between the Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path, we can strategically dissect such temptations. Transcending these tendencies requires commitment to spiritual practices, self-awareness, mentorship, humility, and empathy. By diligently following these steps, we can remain aligned with our higher purpose and foster a deeper spiritual connection.
