Through the eyes of the Maenad, a Dionysian scene unveiled,
In verse and meter, I recite the tale,
Of chaos, trance, and the seductive dance,
Within an intricate poem, we now advance.

Beneath a moon of blood and crimson hue,
The Bacchic revel incarnate anew,
With rhythmic steps, their ecstasy began,
The Maenads danced in primal revel, oh, Pagan!

Torn by passion, mad and wild with glee,
Swept away by the divine and untamed spree.
Their frenzied laughter filled the air,
As they feasted on the blessed debauchery of despair.

By the sacred vine, they shook the earth,
And sat beneath the vined grape, with girth,
The Maenad women screamed to call,
The name of Dionysus, their Lord, their thrall.

Deep within the rites of the dark,
Beneath the grace of the drunken lark,
The mysteries of Dionysian power soared,
Like ivy around the olive branch, they wrapped and coiled.

The music bellowed with sensual song,
Stirring passions held dormant for far too long,
Hypnotic, the sounds of ecstasy arose,
As the frenzied followers partook, trance-like, engrossed.

In a trance, their vacant eyes became one,
As they danced and whirled in unison,
The shaken souls of those in their path,
Unnerved, entranced, in the aftermath.

Bound to seek the essence of life unrestraint,
Through the Dionysian force, madness be their taint,
And through this poem, shared with you, adrift,
You, too, have glimpsed the essence of Dionysian myth.
