1. **Selection of a suitable environment**: 
   A conducive environment is crucial for successful scrying sessions. Select a quiet and private space, ideally a dedicated room or area that can be designated for spiritual work. Consider factors such as ambient lighting, which should be dim and non-distracting, comfortable temperature, and minimal external distractions, such as sounds from outdoors or adjacent rooms. Additionally, ensure the space has a comfortable seating arrangement and is cleansed of negative energies through sage smudging or a similar practice.

2. **Preparation of the black mirror**: 
   The black mirror serves as a focal point for scrying and should be treated with respect. Consecrating and cleansing the mirror are processes by which it is charged with positive energy and purified from external influences. This can be done through anointing the mirror with essential oils (e.g., frankincense or myrrh) while reciting words of empowerment or intention, or by using a ritual consecration process involving the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. The mirror should be kept wrapped in a dark cloth when not in use to maintain its purity.

3. **Creation of a sacred space**: 
   A sacred space allows for focused energy and heightened receptivity during scrying sessions. This space can be created through the arrangement of ritualistic symbols and items, such as candles, incense, and crystals. Begin by setting a protective boundary around the space using salt, stones, or visualized energy. Arrange candles (preferably black, white, or purple) in a circle or at cardinal points for illumination and to represent the element of fire. Use incense (like sandalwood or patchouli) or essential oil diffusers for aroma and to represent the element of air. Incorporate crystals, such as amethyst, obsidian, or clear quartz to amplify and clarify intuitive abilities and represent the elements of earth and water.

4. **Preparatory steps for the practitioner**: 
   Prior to commencing the scrying session, it is essential for the practitioner to be grounded, protected, and mentally prepared. Grounding practices, such as meditation, deep breathing, or engaging with the earth element, can be employed to center oneself and create a stable foundation. Protection may involve calling upon spiritual guides or employing visualizations like surrounding oneself with a white light. Visualization exercises can be practiced to enhance the ability to perceive symbols and images during scrying. Additionally, it is advisable for the practitioner to keep a journal nearby to record any insights or details from the session.

5. **Invocation and intention-setting**: 
   Invoking deities, ancestral spirits, or elemental powers can assist in creating a stronger connection during self-initiation scrying sessions. The particular entity to be invoked will depend on personal beliefs and relationships with the divine and spiritual realms. Be clear with your intention, whether it is seeking guidance, healing energy, or a specific answer. Address your intended entity and request their presence and support respectfully, either through prayer or personal communication.

6. **Entering and exiting the scrying trance and interpreting visions**: 
   Entering the scrying trance involves gazing intently at the black mirror while calming the mind and allowing the conscious awareness to fade. Maintain an open and receptive state while observing any images or symbols that manifest in the mirror. To exit the scrying trance, slowly shift focus from the mirror to the surroundings and take a few deep breaths. Ground yourself and absorb any residual energy. Take time to process and interpret the visions/messages received, utilizing intuition, symbolism, and any correspondence with personal experiences or beliefs. Document the insights in a journal and meditate upon them, seeking further clarification when needed.
