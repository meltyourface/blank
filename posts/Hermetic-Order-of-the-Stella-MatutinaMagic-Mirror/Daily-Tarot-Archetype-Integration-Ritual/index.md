## The Ritual of the Archetypal Path

**Goal**: To harness the power of Tarot Major Arcana archetypes in daily activities and spiritual growth.

Instructions:

1. Prepare your ritual space, ensuring it is clean and free of distractions. Arrange a central table, on which you will place your Tarot deck, a candle (preferably white), a ritual dagger, an elemental representation of Earth (a stone or a crystal), and any other personal ritual items.

2. Begin by performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) to purify and protect your ritual space.

3. Light the white candle, symbolizing the divine light that illuminates the path of spiritual growth.

4. Stand before the table and perform the Kabbalistic Cross, affirming your connection between the divine and the mundane.

5. Invoke the four Archangels of the Quarters:

   - Raphael (East - Air) with the Tarot suit of Swords
   - Michael (South - Fire) with the Tarot suit of Wands
   - Gabriel (West - Water) with the Tarot suit of Cups
   - Uriel (North - Earth) with the Tarot suit of Pentacles

6. Choose a Major Arcana card for the day, which will represent an archetypal energy to work with. Take note of the card's correspondences below:

### I. The Fool: Air, Uranus, Spiritual potential, blue

### II. The Magician: Mercury, Communication, yellow

### III. The High Priestess: Moon, Intuition, silver

### IV. The Empress: Venus, Love, green

### V. The Emperor: Aries, Authority, red

### VI. The Hierophant: Taurus, Tradition, orange

### VII. The Lovers: Gemini, Choices, yellow

### VIII. Strength: Leo, Courage, gold

### IX. The Hermit: Virgo, Solitude, olive green

### X. Wheel of Fortune: Jupiter, Opportunity, violet

### XI. Justice: Libra, Balance, green

### XII. The Hanged Man: Water, Neptune, Surrender, sea-green

### XIII. Death: Scorpio, Transformation, black

### XIV. Temperance: Sagittarius, Balance, blue

### XV. The Devil: Capricorn, Materialism, indigo

### XVI. The Tower: Mars, Conflict, red

### XVII. The Star: Aquarius, Hope, violet

### XVIII. The Moon: Pisces, Illusion, silver

### XIX. The Sun: Sun, Joy, gold

### XX. Judgment: Fire, Pluto, Renewal, orange-red

### XXI. The World: Earth, Saturn, Completion, brown

7. Integrate the chosen archetype into your daily meditation, focusing on its energies, correlating Sephirah on the Tree of Life, elemental associations, and any relevant Divine Names or Words of Power.

8. Throughout the day, reflect on the archetype's energies and look for ways to practically apply its lessons and wisdom to your daily activities.

9. In the evening, meditate on the archetype again, reflecting on your experiences and any insights gained.

10. To close the ritual, perform the Kabbalistic Cross once more and give thanks to the Archangels, asking them to continue providing their guidance and protection.

11. Finally, perform the LBRP once more to banish any lingering energies and close the ritual space.

By practicing this daily ritual, you will deepen your understanding of the Tarot Major Arcana archetypes and their role in the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina, while also developing your ability to integrate their energies into your daily activities and spiritual growth.
