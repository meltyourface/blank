## The Magic Mirror and the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina

Introduction

The Magic Mirror holds a significant position in the practices and rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina, a magical order focused on spiritual development and the advancement of its initiates through the study of the Western esoteric tradition. As a cornerstone of their teaching framework, the Magic Mirror helps initiates refine their psychic abilities, enhance their spiritual insight, and fortify their connection with their inner selves.

### I. History of the Magic Mirror in the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina

The origins of the Magic Mirror can be traced back to various ancient civilizations and their magical practices, but in the context of the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina, its history begins with the establishment of the order in 1903. Founded by S.L. MacGregor Mathers, R.W. Felkin, and other prominent occultists who were formerly members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Stella Matutina aimed to provide a more structured system for personal and spiritual growth.

Within the Stella Matutina, the Magic Mirror became an essential device for self-discovery and spiritual exploration. It was customized to fit the principles and teachings of the order, which were heavily influenced by Hermeticism, Qabbalah, and Alchemy. Over the years, initiates of the Stella Matutina developed and refined methods of working with the Magic Mirror, solidifying its position as a powerful tool within the Order.

### II. Principles Governing the Use of the Magic Mirror

The Magic Mirror's significance within the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina is founded on three key principles that govern its use:

1. The Principle of Correspondence: As above, so below; as below, so above. The Magic Mirror operates on the Hermetic principle that the events and processes of the universe are mirrored in the microcosm of the individual. By studying one's own reflection, an initiate can unlock a deeper understanding of the cosmos and their place within it.

2. The Principle of Reflection: The Magic Mirror serves as a tool for reflection—not just in the literal sense, but also in the metaphysical sense. Through working with the mirror, initiates can explore their inner selves and gain clarity on their thoughts, emotions, and spiritual development.

3. The Principle of the Astral Plane: The Magic Mirror can be utilized as a doorway to access the astral plane—a realm that exists beyond the physical world, where spiritual entities, thought forms, and energies reside. By entering this plane, initiates can communicate with their higher selves, spiritual guides, and other entities, and further develop their psychic and magical abilities.

### III. Instructions for Proper Practice and Techniques

Initiates of the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina can effectively work with the Magic Mirror by following these guidelines:

1. Consecration: Before using the Magic Mirror, it needs to be cleansed and consecrated to align with the spiritual energies and intentions of the practitioner. This process usually involves a ritual that includes prayers, words of power, and the use of consecrated water and incense.

2. Magical Environment: The practice should be performed in a dedicated magical space, which can be a corner of a room or a designated room that is kept clean, free from distractions, and imbued with balanced energies. This space should be adorned with symbols of the practitioner's personal spirituality, and ideally, an altar that faces either the east or the west.

3. Mental and Emotional Preparation: Ensure that you are in a calm, focused, and receptive state before beginning the practice. Meditation, breathing exercises, and clearing the energy of the space can all aid in achieving the right mental state.

4. Scrying Techniques: While gazing into the Magic Mirror, practice scrying—the act of receiving psychic information through focused observation and interpretation of the mirror's reflections. The specific techniques that work best for each individual may vary, but some common practices include:

  - Using candlelight or moonlight: A dimly lit space with a single candle, or moonlight, can provide the optimal conditions for scrying, as it allows the subconscious mind to perceive subtle reflections and unlock psychic visions.

  - Adopting a soft focus: Don't strain your eyes while looking into the mirror. Instead, adopt a soft focus, which allows the visions to emerge naturally.

  - Recording observations: Keep a journal of your scrying sessions, noting any symbols, images, or messages you received. This will help you track your progress and develop your interpretations over time.

5. Reflection and Integration: After each session with the Magic Mirror, take time to reflect on your experiences, integrate any insights or revelations, and apply them to your spiritual growth.

In conclusion, understanding and mastering the use of the Magic Mirror in the context of the Hermetic Order of the Stella Matutina is key to accelerating one's spiritual development. By incorporating the concepts, principles, and techniques outlined in this section, initiates can unlock their innate psychic abilities and gain valuable insights to further their magical and personal growth.
