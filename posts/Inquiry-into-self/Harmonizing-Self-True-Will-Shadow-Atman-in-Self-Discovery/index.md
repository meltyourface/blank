To respond to this knowledge challenge, let us first establish a basic understanding of the key concepts involved, namely: Hermetic principles, Jungian psychology, Eastern spiritual practices, True Will, Shadow, and Atman. 

Hermetic principles refer to a set of philosophical and spiritual teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a mythical figure combining the attributes of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. Traditionally, there are seven key Hermetic principles that guide the understanding of the universe and the self.

Jungian psychology, developed by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung, emphasizes the exploration of the unconscious as a means of attaining self-realization and the integration of opposites within oneself. Prominent concepts within Jungian psychology include the notions of complexes, archetypes, and individuation.

Eastern spiritual practices encompass a broad range of traditions, teachings, and practices primarily originating from India, China, and Japan. Some of these traditions include Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism, focusing on fundamental concepts such as karma, dharma, samsara, and nirvana.

True Will, a concept popularized by the English occultist Aleister Crowley, refers to an individual's deepest, most fundamental purpose or drive, as opposed to their superficial desires and inclinations.

The Shadow, a concept in Jungian psychology, denotes the unconscious part of one's personality that contains repressed instincts, desires, and emotions. The Shadow represents a 'dark' aspect of ourselves, which we may not be consciously aware of or may project upon others.

Atman, a Sanskrit term found in Hinduism and Buddhism, refers to the innermost essence of an individual, often equated with the divine, transcendent self or the ultimate reality.

Having laid this groundwork, we can now explore how the concepts of True Will, Shadow, and Atman intersect and complement each other in the self-discovery process, ultimately resulting in the alchemical transmutation of an individual's consciousness.

The journey to self-discovery can be understood as an ongoing process of revealing, confronting, and integrating various aspects of one's being, leading to a more authentic, awakened, and harmonious state of existence. This understanding of self-discovery is shared by Hermetic, Jungian, and Eastern spiritual traditions, where the process is seen as essential for an individual's spiritual development, enabling personal growth and a deepened understanding of life's purpose.

To actualize the True Will, an individual must come to terms with their Shadow. The confrontation with the Shadow involves recognizing and embracing the repressed aspects of oneself, which are often experienced as embarrassing, shameful, or even frightening. By acknowledging the Shadow, individuals dismantle the barriers preventing them from realizing their full potential.

Jungian psychology and Eastern spiritual practices share the concept of integrating opposites: the conscious and unconscious mind, the good and evil within us, light and darkness. By acknowledging and embracing both sides of our nature, we can achieve a more authentic and balanced sense of self.

Atman is the innermost divine essence that transcends worldly limitations and dualities. To realize one's Atman is, in a sense, to manifest one's True Will and harmoniously integrate the Shadow. It is to recognize one's eternal, unchanging self beyond the fluctuations of temporal existence.

To illustrate the interconnectedness of these concepts, we can envisage the self as a garden: True Will is the innermost seed that seeks to blossom into a vibrant, unique flower; the Shadow represents the weeds and wild, untamed growth that can obstruct the seed's progress; and Atman is the transcendent essence of the garden in its purest, most perfect state. Recognizing and working with these three concepts can nourish and support the seed's growth and empower the gardener on their journey to wholeness and self-discovery.

In conclusion, the concepts of True Will, Shadow, and Atman intersect and complement each other by providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and engaging in the process of self-discovery. The synthesis of Hermetic principles, Jungian psychology, and Eastern spiritual practices can nurture an individual's journey towards self-realization and the alchemical transmutation of their consciousness, leading them to an authentic, integrated, and enlightened existence.
