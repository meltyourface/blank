To accomplish this task, I have chosen an alchemical manuscript known as "The Emerald Tablet," a seminal work attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. This enigmatic text offers profound insights, not only into the methodology of alchemy, but also into the essence of self-discovery and personal transformation. 

Analyzing the Symbolic and Allegorical Layers:

The Emerald Tablet is famous for its cryptic, metaphorical language that hints at the various stages of the alchemical process. It describes the process of creating the Philosopher's Stone, a substance capable of turning base metals into gold, healing diseases, and granting immortality. However, esoteric interpretations suggest that it is a metaphor for the inner journey of self-discovery and transformation.

**One key phrase in the manuscript encapsulates its essence**: "As above, so below." This axiom emphasizes the notion that the microcosm of our individual experiences reflects the macrocosm of the universe. Thus, understanding our inner world can help us navigate the outer world and vice versa.

Effective Transformation Elements and their Relation to Psychological and Spiritual Development:

1. Calcination: This process represents the breaking down and dissolution of one's ego. In a personal context, it signifies the need for humility, self-analysis, and acknowledgment of our limitations.

2. Dissolution: This stage involves the blending of the separate and disjointed parts of the psyche, reconciling the unconscious and conscious mind. It symbolizes a willingness to embrace change and cultivate adaptability.

3. Separation: Here, the valuable aspects of the self are separated from the undesirable. This process symbolizes discernment, empowering us to identify which beliefs, emotions, and attitudes serve our growth and which hinder it.

4. Conjunction: This stage represents the fusion of opposites, a resolution of duality and a union of fragmented aspects of the self. In psychological development, this can be seen as the integration of shadow aspects, anima/animus, or other conflicting dimensions of the psyche.

5. Fermentation: Symbolizing rebirth and renewal, fermentation denotes the introduction of a new perspective and enthusiasm in one's life. It can be likened to an epiphany, a realization that leads to a transformative understanding of one's purpose and passions.

6. Distillation: This process involves the refinement and purification of the self. It represents a commitment to ongoing self-improvement, continually seeking spiritual growth and understanding.

7. Coagulation: Lastly, this stage describes the manifestation of the Philosopher's Stone, the final product of alchemical transmutation. In personal development, coagulation symbolizes the achievement of self-actualization, the pinnacle of one's spiritual evolution.

Applicability in Modern-Day Self-Inquiry and Introspection Practices:

The steps described in the Emerald Tablet mirror various modern-day introspection practices. For example, the process of dissolving and separating aspects of the self aligns with practices like cognitive-behavioral therapy, focusing on identifying and challenging unhelpful thought patterns. Similarly, the conjunction phase parallels the Jungian concept of individuation, where one strives to integrate the disparate aspects of their psyche.

Creating a personal growth plan based on The Emerald Tablet:

1. Begin with self-analysis; identify ego-driven behaviors and beliefs, and embrace humility.
2. Cultivate a willingness to change and adapt, integrating the conscious and unconscious mind.
3. Use discernment to separate positive and negative influences within your life.
4. Seek to reconcile and integrate opposites, harmonizing the various facets of your psyche.
5. Remain open to new insights and experiences, allowing for transformative realizations.
6. Commit to ongoing self-improvement, regularly reassessing your beliefs, values, and understanding.
7. Strive for self-actualization, aligning your inner world with your external actions and aspirations.

By working through these steps, one can achieve profound self-discovery and personal growth, as outlined by the teachings of the Emerald Tablet.
