1. **Unique Found Objects with Inherent Occult Properties**:

a. **Hag Stone**: Hag stones are stones with naturally occurring holes through them, often found in rivers or on beaches. They are believed to hold powerful protection properties and are traditionally used to ward against negative energies and evil spirits.

b. **Rowan Wood Twig**: Rowan trees are known for their strong association with the faerie realm, magic, and protection. A twig from a rowan tree can harness these magical properties, making it an excellent material for a dowsing pendulum.

c. **Raptor Feather**: Feathers from birds of prey, such as eagles or hawks, are considered to carry the spirit and energy of these powerful creatures. They symbolize strength, agility, and heightened intuition, making them a suitable component to incorporate in a pendulum.

2. **Combining Found Object and Energies**:
**Step 1**: Begin by cleansing each of the found objects with a mixture of water and salt or incense smoke to remove any lingering energies.
**Step 2**: Attach the hag stone to the rowan wood twig using a strong, natural fiber such as hemp twine. This union connects the protection qualities of the hag stone with the magical energies of the rowan wood.
**Step 3**: Carefully secure the raptor feather to the opposite end of the rowan twig, aligning its quill with the twig. This brings the power and intuition of the bird spirit into the pendulum.
**Step 4**: Focus your intention on the pendulum's purpose, such as finding artifacts or discerning intuitive guidance, while holding the pendulum in both hands. Visualize the flow of esoteric energy from your hands, through the twig and into the hag stone.

3. **Purification and Consecration Techniques**:

**Purification**:
After crafting the pendulum, purify it with the four elements. Pass the pendulum through incense smoke (Air), a candle flame (Fire), a bowl of water (Water), and finally, sprinkle with salt (Earth). This purification process ensures that the pendulum is cleared of any residual energies it may have absorbed during its creation.

**Consecration**:
During a full moon or a significant date in the lunar cycle, hold the pendulum and recite a consecration ritual or prayer, dedicating the pendulum to the purpose of divination and wisdom. Focus your intention on imbuing the pendulum with this specific purpose, and visualize a white light surrounding and permeating the pendulum.

4. **Incorporating Symbols, Sigils, and Inscriptions**:

To personalize the pendulum for the Cunning man or woman wielding it, select one or more symbols, sigils, or inscriptions that are significant or powerful for the individual practitioner. This can include runes, astrological symbols, or sigils specific to a particular tradition.

Carefully carve, paint, or etch these symbols onto the rowan twig and hag stone, making sure not to disrupt the pendulum's balance. Finally, anoint the symbols with a charged oil or sacred water, consecrating the markings and further linking the pendulum to its intended user and purpose.

In conclusion, by constructing a dowsing pendulum using found objects with inherent esoteric energies, and incorporating personalized symbols, sigils, or inscriptions, the Cunning men and women can create potent, purposeful tools for divination and guidance.
