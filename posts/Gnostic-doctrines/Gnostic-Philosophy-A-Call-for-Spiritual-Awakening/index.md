description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Gnostic doctrines, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a well-structured poem, utilizing a distinctive poetic form such as a sonnet or villanelle, which vividly explores the profound and enigmatic world of Gnostic doctrines. Incorporate a variety of key Gnostic symbols, such as the divine spark, the demiurge, the archons, and aeons, as well as characters like Simon Magus, Hypatia, or Jesus from Gnostic gospels. Enrich the poem with thought-provoking layers of meaning related to the nature of divine knowledge and the pursuit of inner wisdom, while interweaving the influence of ancient texts like the Nag Hammadi library or the Gospel of Thomas.

In shadowed realms far from thine eye does dwell,
A tale untold that sacred minds compel,
Of hidden light and secrets locked away,
Thus, let us sing this cryptic truth, O say.

Upon this sphere of demiurgic strife,
Do souls of man, encased in clay, seek life,
Archons abound that hold their kingly reign,
Within the heavens' dance they forge our pain.

A spark divine within each heart abstruse,
Doth wrestle ceaselessly these chains to loose,
And pray, O sacred Hypatia, to revive,
Through gnostic wisdom, eons of deadened lives.

Gifted bringer of celestial light,
O, Simon Magus, from the heavens alight,
Of gnosis thick ye proffered blackened verse,
Herald the prophecy, the world immerse.

From Nag Hammadi, ancient codex calls,
Disrobed in secret, wisdom's light befalls,
Reveal to mankind, Gospel of Thomas claims,
Within thine own search dwells the hallowed names.

When Twelve Disciples silent questions spoke,
Aeon Jesus, truth unshackled broke,
Their hearts ablaze with wisdom's inner seed,
Awake! O blinded, shall the spirit bleed?

Each step within, descend the layered soul,
Worlds within worlds, divining truth the goal,
To pierce illusion's thin and hardened shell,
And on the shackled mind, transcending swell.

In silence find the echo, ringing true,
A mirror's gaze reflects thine unseen hue,
To find the pearl, within thy oyster bays,
Unlock thy door, and upward climb Life's maze.

Now, hear the word, ye masters of the sway,
A tender call to Nature's heart, O stay,
And like Hypatia in her twilight's throne,
With love enrobe her bosom, as thine own.

May we reflect the ancient light within,
Shed withered husks of painful birth and sin,
And rise as one, embraced by starlit grace,
To claim our heritage within God's space.
