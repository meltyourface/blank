## The Ritual of the Sacred Sphinx: Invoking the Powers of the Egyptian Pantheon

Purpose: To invoke the energies of the Egyptian pantheon, strengthening the practitioner's connection with these ancient deities and channeling their power for spiritual growth, protection, and wisdom.

Preparations:

1. Set up an altar in the center of the ritual space in an eastward direction. Place candles and incense representing each of the four elements on their respective cardinal points (east - air, south - fire, west - water, north - earth). Additionally, place an ankh and a golden disk symbolizing Ra on the altar.

2. Wear a robe of appropriate color, representing authority and purity. Adorn yourself with a lamen featuring the symbol of the Golden Dawn blended with the Eye of Horus.

3. Familiarize yourself with the appropriate Hebrew God-names, angelic forces, and chants corresponding to each Egyptian deity.
**Step 1**: Preliminary Rituals

Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and the Middle Pillar Exercise to purify the ritual space and prepare for the invoking of the Egyptian deities.
**Step 2**: Invocation of the Four Elements

Starting from the east, invoke each element in its respective direction, utilizing the corresponding tools:

- Air: Incense burner, invoking Shu, God of air.
- Fire: Candle, invoking Ra, God of the sun, as well as Sekhmet, Goddess of fire and war.
- Water: Chalice, invoking Tefnut, Goddess of water, and Osiris, God of the Nile.
- Earth: Pentacle, invoking Geb, God of the earth.
**Step 3**: Invocation of the Pentagram and Hexagram

Draw the invoking pentagrams and hexagrams of each element in the air, starting from the east and moving clockwise. Chant the correct Hebrew God-names and angelic forces while visualizing the radiant energy of the associated Egyptian deities.
**Step 4**: Sacred Union of Nut and Geb

Standing before the altar, extend your arms towards the heavens, invoking Nut, the sky Goddess. Lower your arms to the earth, invoking Geb. Visualize a stream of divine energy connecting both deities through your body, uniting the heavens and earth.
**Step 5**: Invoking the Sacred Sphinx

Chant the following invocation:

"O Sacred Sphinx, guardian of knowledge and mystery, awaken in me the wisdom of the Egyptian pantheon. Unveil the secrets hidden beyond time and space, and make a pact between these ancient powers and my soul."

Visualize the great Sphinx materializing before you, emanating a radiant golden aura, signifying the connection to the Egyptian pantheon.
**Step 6**: Communion with the Egyptian Deities

Holding the ankh, connect with each deity, expressing intentions, asking for insights, and forming a bond with their energies. Visualize them bestowing their blessings upon you with streams of powerful light.
**Step 7**: The Closing Ritual

Close the ritual by offering gratitude to the deities, visualizing their energy receding. Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and the Middle Pillar Exercise, sealing the energies and balancing the sacred forces within the ritual space. Extinguish the elemental candles, starting from the north and moving counterclockwise.

Repeat this ritual as needed to deepen your connection with the Egyptian pantheon and channel their sacred energies to benefit your spiritual path, manifesting in wisdom, protection, and personal growth.
