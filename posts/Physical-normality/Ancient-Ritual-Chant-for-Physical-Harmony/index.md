In the circle of the ancient ways,
We gather now in solemn praise,
Conjuring mysteries profound,
To sanctify this hallowed ground.

From the cardinal directions four,
North and South, and East and West,
May each bring strengths we all adore,
In the name of Physical normality, at our behest.

Earth and air, water and fire,
Bound by the essence of matter's pyre,
Alchemic union of elements born,
To consecrate the Earth we adorn.

As rhythm and harmony entwine,
Beneath the sun, and moon's divine,
We chant to signify our intent,
A ciphered melody, a sacred lament.

Vibrations intricately weave,
Through each breath, each word, each heave,
Of energies converging to pay respect,
To the material world we thus connect.

Whispers of cryptic phrase,
Ephemeral voices sing their praise,
"In heart and sinew, bone and stone,
Invoke the tethered force unknown."

Ciphered secrets come to light,
Through intricate metaphors of autumn's night,
Veiled revelations that guide our way,
Transcending the realms of mortal day.

A chant we echo to touch the fray,
Shadowed realms and worldly play,
Rise, kindred spirits, in solemn might,
To anchor the inceptive rite.

This incantation, a master's call,
The echo of ages that bind us all,
We pass these words from breath to breath,
A testimony to life and death.

Fulfill this summon to the Earth we hail,
And in the sights of Physical normality, prevail,
No power opposed, no spirit wane,
Let this enigmatic rite sustain.
