## Ritual of Purification and Recharge for Divination Tools

**Purpose**: To purify and recharge a chosen divination tool, such as a crystal ball, pendulum, or tarot cards, removing unwanted energies and influences, realigning the tool's natural vibrations with the physical realm, and promoting accurate divinatory readings.

Required Items:
1. Divination tool (crystal ball, pendulum, or tarot cards)
2. A cloth or mat for laying the tool on
3. A bowl of purified water
4. A small dish of salt
5. A white candle
6. An incense stick or cone (optional)
7. A suitable symbol (a simple circle representing balance and unity can be used)

Setting and Preparation:
- Choose a quiet, clean, and comfortable space in which to perform the ritual.
- Lay the cloth or mat on a flat surface, placing the divination tool on it.
- Light the white candle and the incense (if desired) to help create a sacred atmosphere.
- Draw or place the chosen symbol near the tool.

The Ritual:
**Step 1**: Ground and Center
- Stand or sit in a comfortable position and focus on your breathing.
- Visualize a grounding cord extending from the base of your spine down into the earth, connecting your energy to the earth's core.
- Take a few deep breaths, inhaling love, peace, and clarity, and exhaling any negativity or distractions.
**Step 2**: Cast a Circle of Protection
- Using the salt, draw a circle around the entire setup (tool, cloth, candle, etc.).
- As you draw the circle, visualize a protective energy barrier forming around the space that keeps unwanted energies at bay.
- Say aloud: "Sacred space I create, none may enter, negativity dissipates, within this circle, only light and love shall integrate. So mote it be."
**Step 3**: Call Upon Guardian Energies
- Close your eyes and call upon any guardian energies, spirit guides, angels, or archetypal forces that resonate with you and your purpose.
- Ask for their guidance and assistance in purifying and recharging your divination tool.
**Step 4**: Purification and Recharging Process
- Hold your divination tool with both hands and visualize a brilliant white light enveloping it, removing any residual energies or influences.
- Say aloud: "By the power of this sacred light, I cleanse and purify this (tool's name) of all unwanted energies and influences. May it become a clear and accurate conduit for divine wisdom and truth."

- Dip your fingers into the purified water and sprinkle it onto the divination tool while reciting: "Water of purity, cleanse and refresh this (tool's name), ensuring clarity in all things revealed."

- Take a small pinch of salt and gently rub it onto the divination tool, saying: "Salt of the earth, purify and charge this (tool's name), imbuing it with the stability and power of the physical realm."
**Step 5**: Alignment and Activation
- Hold your divination tool in both hands and focus on the chosen symbol while slowly reciting: "Sacred circle of unity, align this (tool's name) with the energies of the physical realm, restoring balance and harmony."

- Then, visualize the white light from step 4 once more, allowing it to flow from your hands into the divination tool, reactivating and boosting its inherent powers.
**Step 6**: Close and Give Thanks
- Thank any guardian energies, spirit guides, angels, or archetypal forces that joined you during the ritual, releasing them with gratitude.
- Say: "I thank you, guardians of the sacred space and my beloved spiritual guides, for your support and protection. Go in peace, with love and gratitude in my heart."

- Finally, erase or remove the salt circle, knowing that the ritual has been completed and is sealed.

Your divination tool is now purified and recharged, ready for use in providing accurate and clear divinatory readings. After completing the ritual, remember to regularly cleanse and recharge your divination tool following any intense usage to maintain its potency and accuracy.
