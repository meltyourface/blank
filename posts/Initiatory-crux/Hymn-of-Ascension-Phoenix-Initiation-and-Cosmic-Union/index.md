## Title: Hymn of Ascension to the Radiant Phoenix

### I. The Awakened Soul
In the twilight of life's arduous prose,
A dormant spark, yearning to be known,
Kindled within, a blazes, unfolds,
Radiant Phoenix, we seek thy abode.

Embark our paths, O sacred flame,
On initiatory crux, the soul reclaimed,
From ashes, arise, purified hearts,
Eclipsed by the veil of mortal art.

In fiery rebirth, shed the mundane,
Bright-eyed seekers, truth's terrain,
Illusions vanished, wisdom regained,
Through auburn red, we wear thy stain.

### II. The Threshold of Transformation
Through the dark night of shadows deep,
We tread the labyrinth, the mysteries keep,
The inner sanctum, veiled in myth,
Led by the light, the Phoenix's gift.

Guided through the trials, the crucible's fire,
We dance with shadows, transmuting desires,
The alchemical fusion, transcending states,
In the forge of chaos, our spirit creates.

Upon the brink, where worlds collide,
The chasm bridged, cross we with pride,
Resolute hearts, may we embrace,
The Phoenix's luminous, regenerative grace.

### III. The Transcendent Union
From the ashes of old, the soul reborn,
The Phoenix's wings to the heavens soar,
Initiates' hearts aflame with passion,
Aligned to the Source, celestial connection.

In exalted heights, we overcame,
The weighted anchors, the earthbound chains,
Now illumined, alight on love's bliss,
Cosmic expansion, unbound, limitless.

O Radiant Phoenix, as above, so below,
The eternal cycle, the sacred flow,
Through mastery of the initiatory crux,
In thy sacred name, we do entrust.
