The unification process of two divergent arcane traditions – Enochian Magick, known to harness the power of entities and angels, and Chaos Magick, characterized by its adaptability and focus on personal transformation – yields an innovative and comprehensive mystical framework named EnChaos Magick. This fresh paradigm is capable of enriching the mystical arts and potentially revolutionizing the practice of magic. Let us examine the facets of each magical system detailed in the prompt.

1. Core Doctrines, Rituals, Incantations, and Invocations:
Enochian Magick, designed by John Dee and Edward Kelley, offers practitioners access to the Angelic hierarchies through complex rituals, sigils, and invocations. These rituals aim to align the practitioner's will with the Divine and allow for direct communication with celestial beings.
In contrast, Chaos Magick, founded by Peter J. Carroll and other occultists, focuses on results and personal gnosis. Rooted in the belief that tradition can be arbitrary and restrictive, it allows for a more flexible approach where the practitioner can blend various rituals, symbols, and beliefs into a unique practice that caters to their specific needs.

2. Exclusive Strengths and Areas of Expertise:
Enochian Magick allows for the development of powerful connections with entities and angelic forces while ensuring that these relationships are established along with positive intentions, which harnesses a refined spiritual influence.
Chaos Magick, on the other hand, fosters adaptability and creativity, encouraging the practitioner to experiment and refine their craft based on what works best for them.

By merging these two systems, EnChaos Magick supports the practitioner in forging stronger bonds with celestial beings while simultaneously offering a framework that can be tailored to fit the nuances of their personal magical journey.

3. Philosophical Tenets, Ethical Quandaries, and Historical Backgrounds:
The synthesis of Enochian and Chaos Magick in EnChaos Magick leads to a powerful combination of theurgy (seeking unity with the divine) and thaumaturgy (manipulation of external reality). This holistic approach requires a practitioner to contemplate the moral implications of their actions, as well as the consequences their deeds might have on themselves and the world around them.

Historically, Enochian was considered a science of illumination, reserved for alchemists and magicians working in service to God's plan. Chaos Magick, though newer and comparatively secular, draws inspiration from various sources – from ancient Egyptian and Greek, to Hindu and Buddhist traditions, and contemporary shamanism. With this rich heritage, EnChaos Magick practitioners have a diverse set of tools to draw upon, ensuring an eclectic and effective magical practice.

4. Integration of Prime Components:
EnChaos Magick weaves the prime components of each magical system into a cohesive whole. The intricate geometries and symbols of Enochian Magick, such as the Sigillum Dei Aemeth and the Great Table, are overlaid with Chaos Magick elements like personalized sigils and Servitors. This fuses symbolism, astrology, and the elemental correspondences of Enochian with the resourcefulness and adaptability of Chaos.

**Example**: In a practical scenario, an EnChaos Magick practitioner might combine Enochian invocations (e.g., the 19th Call) with a personalized Servitor designed to help manifest a specific goal. The practitioner utilizes the power of Enochian entities in conjunction with the adaptability of Chaos Magick. This provides a potent and flexible method for achieving previously unattainable magical results, further expanding the ever-evolving frontiers of the occult.
