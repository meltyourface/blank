To answer this challenge effectively, we will first provide an outline of the underlying occult principles pertaining to the two pillars of occultism, Magic and obscurity. Subsequently, we will delve into the correlations and synthesis between these pillars and illustrate how an initiate could maximize their potential by integrating these principles into a unified system for self-exploration and transcendent wisdom.

### I. Underlying Principles:

A. Magic:
Magic, in the context of occultism, refers to the metaphysical art of causing change in accordance with one's will and intent. Multiple forms of Magic exist, such as Ceremonial, Chaos, or Natural Magic, each with its set of methods and techniques. However, there are three fundamental principles that underlie all forms of Magic:

1. Correspondences: The belief that everything in the universe is interconnected and can be manipulated through understanding and tapping into the relationships between elements, symbols, and ideas.

2. Invocation and Evocation: The practice of utilizing the energies and virtues of metaphysical forces (e.g., gods, angels, spirits, and archetypes) to bring about desired change. Invocation involves internalizing these energies, while evocation entails calling upon external entities.

3. Willpower and Intention: The cornerstone of Magic practice, asserting one's willpower and focusing one's intent are crucial in manifesting desired outcomes. This highlights the intrinsic link between mental states and external reality.

B. Obscurity:
In the context of occultism, obscurity refers to the veiling of knowledge, truth, and wisdom under layers of symbolism, esotericism, and secret teachings. This serves to protect sacred information from the profane and ensure that only the dedicated and disciplined can access it. Key principles of obscurity include:

1. Initiation: A ceremonial passage that signifies entry into a closed community or mystery school and provides access to deeper, hidden truths.

2. Esotericism: This constitutes a system of specialized knowledge, symbols, or practices reserved for the initiated. It is central to many occult philosophies and spiritual disciplines.

3. Mystical Experiences: Obscurity encourages the pursuit of direct, personal experiences with the divine or supernatural. Such experiences provide a deeper understanding of reality, transcending the limitations of rational thought.

### II. Correlations and Synthesis:

There are several significant correlations between the principles of Magic and obscurity. Firstly, they both outline the importance of symbolic and metaphysical relationships in understanding reality. This is evident in the principle of correspondences and the role of esotericism. Secondly, both pillars emphasize the exclusive nature of occult knowledge, with obscurity shielding the information from the uninitiated, while Magic necessitates mastery of intricate techniques.

To synthesize these two pillars into one comprehensive system, an initiate could follow this progressive path towards self-discovery and transcendent wisdom:

1. Begin with the study of esoteric correspondences and symbols, gradually unraveling their concealed meanings. This solidifies their foundation in occult understanding.

2. Engage in regular meditation and self-contemplation to develop focus, willpower, and a deeper connection with their true self.

3. Utilize esoteric knowledge to construct personalized rituals and practices, invoking or evoking metaphysical forces to achieve desired outcomes.

4. Undergo initiation into a mystery school or tradition to expand their knowledge and gain access to more potent secrets and techniques. This process will involve tests and challenges to ensure they possess the requisite dedication and discernment.

5. Pursue direct mystical experiences to transcend rational limitations and evolve both personally and spiritually.

### III. Summary:

To synthesize the two pillars of occultism, Magic and obscurity, an initiate must fully comprehend the underlying principles of each and integrate them into a unified system. By mastering correspondences and esotericism, invoking metaphysical forces, developing willpower, undergoing initiation, and pursuing mystical experiences, an adept can embark upon a transformative journey of self-discovery and reach transcendent wisdom, applying Magic and obscurity to profoundly alter their reality and unlock their full potential.
