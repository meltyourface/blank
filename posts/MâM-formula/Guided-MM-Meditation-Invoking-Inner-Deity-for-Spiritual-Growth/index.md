description: "You are a master of the esoteric, occult, M\xE2\u20AC\xA6.M formula, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task."
excerpt: > 
  Develop a guided meditation that incorporates the M\xE2\u20AC\xA6.M formula, specifically designed to invoke and access an inner deity or spiritual archetype. The meditation should progress through multiple precise stages, such as entering a sacred space, calling upon the chosen archetype using secret esoteric symbols, and engaging in a dialogue with the deity to gain wisdom and spiritual insights. Additionally, the meditation should incorporate advanced visualization techniques, breathing patterns, and sound frequencies to enhance the experience, ultimately leading to a profound spiritual connection with the selected archetype.

M...M Guided Meditation: Invoking the Inner Deity or Spiritual Archetype

Stage 1: Preparation
1. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you can sit or lie down.
2. Ensure you won't be disturbed for the duration of the meditation (approximately 20-30 minutes)
3. Wear comfortable, loose clothing.

Stage 2: Entering the Sacred Space
1. Close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth.
2. Visualize a glowing sphere of golden light at your heart center.
3. Imagine the sphere expanding with each breath, creating a sacred space around you.

Stage 3: Calling upon the Chosen Archetype
1. Choose a spiritual archetype or inner deity that resonates with you (e.g., a deity from mythology, spiritual figure, or even a symbol).
2. Mentally recite the M...M formula (Morphic Metamorphosis): "Morphic Metamorphosis, I invite [chosen archetype] into my sacred space."
3. Visualize a bridge of light connecting you to the chosen archetype, and feel the energy of the archetype entering your sacred space.

Stage 4: Advanced Visualization Techniques
1. Envision the chosen archetype coming to life in front of you.
2. Observe all its characteristics, colors, and energy.
3. Engage your senses to perceive the ambiance, temperature, and aroma surrounding the inner deity.

Stage 5: Breathing Patterns
1. Begin the four-fold breath pattern: inhale for four counts, hold for four counts, exhale for four counts, and hold for four counts again.
2. Mentally recite "Morphic Metamorphosis" during each count.
3. Continue this breathing pattern throughout the meditation.

Stage 6: Sound Frequencies
1. Slowly introduce a mantra or vibratory sound (e.g., OM or AUM) as you continue the four-fold breath pattern.
2. Repeat the sound mentally or audibly, synchronizing it with your breaths.
3. Feel the sound's vibratory frequency resonating with your chosen archetype.

Stage 7: Dialogue with the Inner Deity
1. Ask the chosen archetype for wisdom, guidance, or insights.
2. Receive the information through thoughts, images, feelings, or sensations.
3. Take the time to absorb and contemplate the knowledge you receive, maintaining the connection through mantra and breath.

Stage 8: Expressing Gratitude
1. Thank the chosen archetype for their presence, wisdom, and guidance.
2. Mentally recite the M...M formula: "Morphic Metamorphosis, I release [chosen archetype] from my sacred space."
3. Release the connection, allowing the archetype to return to their realm.

Stage 9: Returning to the Physical World
1. Return to the four-fold breath pattern if you have stopped using it, to ground your energy.
2. Slowly bring your awareness back to your body and surroundings.
3. When you feel ready, open your eyes and take a few moments to reflect on the experience.

You have now completed the M...M Guided Meditation. As you incorporate this practice into your daily routine, you will cultivate a deeper connection with your chosen archetype, unlocking spiritual insights, and personal growth.
