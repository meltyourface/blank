In the realm of Sacred horror, a successful unholy banishing ritual demands intricate preparations, and sinister precautions to counter malevolent forces that may surface. The following steps outline the methodical stages required for such a solemn and dark undertaking.
**Step 1**: Selecting the ritual location
Choose a location steeped in macabre history such as an abandoned church, a haunted cemetery, or cursed grounds where dark energies are known to lurk. The site must bear telltale signs of supernatural activity, which amplifies its powerful occult vibrations.
**Step 2**: Acquiring the esoteric tools
Unearth and gather sacred tools to aid in conjuring the malevolent deities. **Among these instruments are**:

1. An obsidian ritual dagger – blessed by an ancient sorcerer and used for inscriptions and symbolism during the ritual.
2. A chalice fashioned from human skull – a vessel to hold sacrificial blood offering crucial to complete the ritual.
3. Sigil of Banishing – an ancient, complex geometric design drawn on parchment using ink from a crow's blood to invoke the deity's favor.
4. Candles made of human fat – morbid elements adept in summoning the darkest of energies to catalyze the ritual.
**Step 3**: Preparations for protective measures
Adorn yourself with consecrated occult attire, such as robes etched with esoteric symbols for repelling malicious energies. Craft a protective barrier using salt circles drawn around the ritual area. Trace powerful protective symbols in the air using a lit embers, which aid in warding off hostile presences.
**Step 4**: Summoning ancient deities
Invoke the ancient deities significant to your unholy banishing ritual. Chant a dark, guttural invocation in an arcane tongue with fervency to call forth the gods of malice and destruction. Offer the blood within the chalice as a contract between you and the summoned deity, a gesture to secure their allegiance and assistance.
**Step 5**: Banishing the malevolent force
Utilize the Sigil of Banishing, the ritual dagger, and the deity's newfound allegiance to confront and banish the malignant energy looming in the shadows of the Sacred horror realm. With ruthless precision, carve the Sigil of Banishing onto the very grounds where the force originates while intoning the deity's name and commanding the entity's eviction from its unholy refuge.
**Step 6**: Closing the portal
Devise a controlled inferno, using the human fat candles as fuel, to consume the sigils and other remnants of the banishing rite. As the flames surge, chant an ancient mantra that seals cosmic voids, thus thwarting the possibility of any residual energies or spiritual reprisals.
**Step 7**: Cleansing the ritual site
Once the malevolent force has been vanquished and the portal sealed, remove all lingering negative energies by smudging the site with holy incense. Dispel and neutralize the area by sprinkling consecrated water, anointing the earth where the ritual transpired to prevent future invocations or returning entities.

This meticulous and sinister unholy banishing ritual, when executed with unwavering resolve and precision, harnesses the powerful dominion of Sacred horror, effectively banishing even the most ferocious malevolent forces for eternity.
