In order to fully respond to this knowledge challenge, let us first establish a comprehensive understanding of its core components - sacred horror, psychological transformation, spiritual growth, and the protagonist's journey through facing their deepest fears and supernatural encounters. As we proceed, we shall carefully analyze the influence of symbolism, archetypes, and metaphysical reflections on the protagonist's transformation and growth.

Sacred horror is a unique genre that combines elements of the supernatural, the mysterious, and the divine, often exploring the darker aspects of human spirituality, consciousness, and the nature of existence. In literary works belonging to this genre, protagonists commonly embark on a path of self-discovery and transformation that involves confronting fears, engaging with supernatural entities, and transcending commonly held limitations. 

Psychological transformation refers to a significant shift in a person's thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. In the context of sacred horror, this change often occurs when the protagonist confronts and overcomes their deepest fears and the supernatural, prompting a newfound understanding of their existence and place within the universe. This transformation can lead to a renewed sense of outer and inner strength, deep philosophical insights, and personal empowerment.

Spiritual growth, on the other hand, is the process of expanding one's consciousness and understanding of the various aspects of life, existence, and the divine. In sacred horror, spiritual growth is often achieved by facing the unknown, exploring the outer reaches of human perception, and assimilating the lessons and wisdom acquired during the protagonist's encounters with the supernatural.

As we delve deeper into the protagonist's journey, let's consider the roles of symbolism, archetypes, and metaphysical reflections in their psychological transformation and spiritual growth.

- Symbolism: Symbolism is at the heart of sacred horror, with various symbols serving to represent larger ideas and aspects of the protagonist's journey. For example, a menacing shadow may symbolize hidden fears or repressed emotions, while a shattered mirror might represent fragmented perceptions of the self and reality. Encountering and interpreting these symbols often plays a crucial role in the protagonist's transformation, as they are forced to confront and integrate the meanings and insights they hold.

- Archetypes: Archetypes, which are universally recognized motifs or themes, also play a significant role in sacred horror. Archetypal characters, such as the wise mentor, the dark trickster, or the struggling hero, interact with the protagonist and contribute to their growth and transformation. These encounters can reveal the protagonist's subconscious fears, desires, and motivations, often resulting in epiphanies that reshape their understanding of themselves and the world.

- Metaphysical Reflections: By engaging with metaphysical concepts like the nature of existence, the boundaries of human perception, and the interconnectedness of all things, sacred horror prompts the protagonist (and the reader) to reflect deeply on their own life and spiritual journey. In facing their deepest fears and traversing supernatural landscapes, the protagonist may experience moments of profound metaphysical insight, catalyzing growth and change within themselves.

In conclusion, sacred horror is a rich and multifaceted genre that often leads its protagonists on transformative journeys in which they face their deepest fears and the supernatural, aided by a tapestry of symbolism, archetypes, and metaphysical reflections. These elements combine to create a profound psychological transformation and potential spiritual growth for the protagonist, offering insights into our own inner worlds and the mysteries of existence.
