The knowledge challenge in question requires a full response, delving deep into the historical, cultural, and spiritual significance of various methods and tools used for Spirit Communication, such as mediumship, divination, astral projection, and channeling. Contemplating potential ethical considerations and risks that might emerge as a result of their implementation is also integral for answering this challenge. Lastly, the interconnection of these diverse elements will be explored to illuminate our ability to attain a comprehensive understanding of the multidimensionality of the Spirit Communication process.

To begin, let's explore the historical context of each method and tool used for Spirit Communication. 

1. **Mediumship**: Mediumship dates back to ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, where individuals were believed to communicate with the spirits of the deceased. This practice continued through various cultures and time periods, including the Spiritualist movement of the 19th century in the United States and Europe, which popularized mediumship as a means for providing solace and closure through contacting departed loved ones, guidance, or insight into the afterlife.

2. **Divination**: Divination, the practice of seeking information or foresight through supernatural means, has roots in numerous ancient cultures, including Mesopotamia, China, and the Celts, among others. Methods of divination vary widely, from I Ching and Tarot to scrying and pendulum dowsing. These time-tested techniques have endured, illustrating a persistent human desire for accessing hidden knowledge or guidance.

3. **Astral Projection**: Similarly, astral projection, or out-of-body experiences, has historical foundations in various religious and mystical traditions, such as ancient Egypt, Gnosticism, Hinduism, and shamanic cultures. These traditions attribute profound spiritual significance to the astral body and its capacity to traverse non-physical realms for insight and enlightenment.

4. **Channeling**: Channeling is the practice of opening oneself up as a conduit for spirits or higher beings to communicate messages or wisdom. Similar to mediumship, channeling has been practiced throughout history within diverse cultural and spiritual contexts. It often involves the practitioner achieving a trance-like state, allowing the channeled entity to speak through them or share their energy and insights. 

With an understanding of these practices' historical context, let's move to an examination of their cultural and spiritual significance. Each of the outlined methods serves the broader purpose of connecting the practitioner or seeker with the non-physical, or spiritual, dimensions of reality, transcending the bounds of ordinary human perception and understanding. They provide avenues to access guidance, insight, or healing and foster a deeper connection with the spiritual world and the interconnectedness of all beings.

As the knowledge challenge also requests contemplation of potential ethical considerations and risks associated with such practices, various factors merit attention. Given the sensitive nature of human psyche and the potential for emotional manipulation, there is a potential for unscrupulous practitioners to exploit those seeking comfort, guidance, or healing. Additionally, the prospect of spiritual deception emerges - the risk of engaging with potentially malevolent or manipulative spirits/entities. Furthermore, ethical concerns may surface with regard to respecting the consent and autonomy of the spirits/entities involved in communication, channeling, or invocation processes.

Bringing together these diverse elements of historical, cultural, and spiritual significance, ethical considerations, and risks associated with Spirit Communication sheds light on their entwined nature. In pursuit of attaining a comprehensive understanding of the multidimensionality of Spirit Communication, one must wrestle with the complex, multifaceted nature of these practices and their implications, not only as individual components but also as an interconnected whole.

In conclusion, the various methods and tools of Spirit Communication hold deep historical, cultural, and spiritual significance across time and cultures. They collectively serve to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual worlds, providing insight, guidance, or healing. Each practice is imbued with unique characteristics, yet all share a connection rooted in the desire to communicate with non-physical realms. Ethical considerations and risks emerge as we explore these methods, reminding us of the importance of engaging in such practices with respect, discernment, and integrity. It is through understanding and integrating these diverse elements that we can pursue a more comprehensive understanding of the multidimensionality of the Spirit Communication process.
