1. **Identification of specific ritual tools**:

Within the domain of Sortes, there are several essential tools that practitioners rely on to perform their rituals and connect with occult energies. These tools include summoning circles, talismans, a ritual dagger (athame), a chalice, a wand, a censer or incense burner, a representation of the elements (earth, air, fire, water), and a book of shadows (a personal journal for documenting rituals, spells, and experiences).

2. Significance, properties, and symbolism of each tool:

a) Summoning Circle: The summoning circle is a sacred geometry used to create a boundary of protection, focus energy, and create a bridge between the physical and astral worlds. It is unique in its ability to harness energy and protect the practitioner during rituals.

b) Talisman: A talisman is an object imbued with specific intentions and energies, often used for protection, guidance, or attracting desired outcomes. Talismans hold great significance in the Sortes practice as physical manifestations of our intentions.

c) Athame: A ritual dagger symbolizes the element of air and the power of intellect and discernment. It plays a pivotal role in directing energy and cutting away negative influences.

d) Chalice: Represents the element of water and the feminine energies of intuition, nurturing, and receptivity. It is used for ritual offerings, libations, and symbolic representation of the divine feminine.

e) Wand: Symbolizes the element of fire and the masculine attribute of willpower and creation. The wand directs and focuses energy during ritual work and creation processes.

f) Censer or incense burner: Represents the element of air and serves to cleanse the ritual space by burning specific herbs or resins.

g) Elemental representations: Physical tokens or symbols of earth, air, fire, and waterâ€”essential components in many Sortes rituals.

h) Book of Shadows: A personal and unique journal to document spiritual growth, experiences, spells, and rituals within the practitioner's journey.

3. **Multistep cleansing process using focused intention and visualization**:

Step 1: Ground and center your energy. Connect with the earth and visualize a protective energy surrounding you.

Step 2: Hold the ritual tool in your hands and envision a bright, white light emanating from your heart center, enveloping the object and penetrating deeply, infusing it with pure, positive energy.

Step 3: Visualize any impurities, negativity, or unwanted energies being expelled from the tool as a dark smoke or mist that dissolves harmlessly into the Earth.

Step 4: Submerge the tool in consecrated saltwater (or an appropriate medium for the specific object) to further purify and cleanse it.

Step 5: Dry the tool carefully and store it in a clean, sacred space to preserve its new charge and energetic purity.

4. Incorporating esoteric symbols, sigils, or mantras:

During steps 2 and 3, practitioners could inscribe or mentally project specific sigils or symbols associated with purification and protection onto the ritual tools. Alternatively, reciting or chanting a mantra or affirmation during the visualization process reinforces the intentions and amplifies the effects of the cleansing and consecration.

5. **Measurable scale to determine the effectiveness of the developed method**:

To gauge how well the procedure works, practitioners can assess the intensity and duration of their rituals, the ease of achieving a focused and aligned state, and any notable changes in their connection with the occult energies. Alternatively, practitioners might employ divination techniques such as pendulum dowsing to determine the energetic purity of the tools after performing the cleansing process.
