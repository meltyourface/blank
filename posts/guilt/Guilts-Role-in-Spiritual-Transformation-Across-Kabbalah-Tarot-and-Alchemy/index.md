To address this knowledge challenge, we will first need to establish a basic understanding of the concepts involved: the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, Tarot's Major Arcana, and alchemical transmutation. Subsequently, we will explore the archetypal and symbolic associations of guilt in each system and their interrelations. Finally, we will discuss how these interconnected themes relate to an individual's internal journey of self-awareness, transformation, and redemption.

1. **Concepts Overview**:

a. **Kabbalistic Tree of Life**: The Kabbalistic Tree of Life is a symbolic representation of the cosmos and the divine emanations within it. It comprises ten spheres or sephiroth, which represent different aspects of God and the creative process. Each sephirah is connected through 22 paths, which represent the valuable spiritual lessons or principles individuals must comprehend and apply to progress in their spiritual journey.

b. **Tarot's Major Arcana**: The Major Arcana is a set of 22 cards in a Tarot deck, each representing a distinct spiritual archetype or significant life lesson. These cards often symbolize important life stages, moral quandaries, and psychological challenges that individuals must overcome to achieve spiritual growth and self-awareness.

c. **Alchemical Transmutation**: Alchemy is an ancient practice that sought the transmutation of base metals into gold and the discovery of the elixir of life. Symbolically, alchemical transmutation represents a process of internal transformation where individuals purify and refine their inner nature, transcending their base instincts and achieving an enlightened state of mind.

2. Guilt in Kabbalah, Tarot, and Alchemy

a. **Guilt in Kabbalistic Tree of Life**: Guilt can be seen as an aspect of the sephirah of Gevurah, which represents divine judgment, strength, and severity. Gevurah corresponds to the Divine's corrective power and highlights the importance of recognizing, confronting, and overcoming transgressions or imbalances to achieve spiritual harmony.

b. **Guilt in Tarot's Major Arcana**: The Major Arcana card most closely associated with guilt is The Devil (card XV). The Devil represents temptation, attachment, and excessive materialism, oftentimes highlighting unresolved feelings of guilt, insecurity, or self-sabotage holding individuals back from realizing their highest selves.

c. **Guilt in Alchemical Transmutation**: Guilt is symbolically expressed in alchemy through the Nigredo or the blackening phase, wherein individuals confront and identify their shadow aspects, including guilt, regret, and other psychological burdens. Recognizing and resolving these obstacles is a crucial step in the transmutative process of spiritual refinement.

3. Guilt, Transformation, and Redemption:

a. **Recognizing Guilt**: Acknowledging guilt's presence is an essential step towards self-awareness. Be it through Gevurah's judgment, The Devil's temptations, or the Nigredo phase in alchemy, individuals must confront guilt and understand how it hinders their emotional and spiritual growth.

b. **Processing Guilt**: Once guilt is recognized, individuals need to delve into its sources and implications. In both Kabbalistic and alchemical teachings, this involves acknowledging imperfections and imbalances, and working on expunging them to achieve equilibrium. In Tarot, the wisdom of other Major Arcana cards such as The Hermit (introspection) and Judgement (forgiveness and renewal) can offer valuable insights for processing guilt.

c. **Transforming and Redeeming Guilt**: Learning from guilt is key for personal transformation. Utilizing the principles represented in Kabbalah, Tarot, and alchemy, individuals can turn guilt into valuable lessons and catalysts for change, leading to redemption and enlightenment.

In conclusion, the archetypal and symbolic associations of guilt in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, Tarot's Major Arcana, and alchemical transmutation are intricately connected to the individual's internal journey of self-awareness, transformation, and redemption. By acknowledging and confronting guilt, individuals develop greater self-awareness and emotional resilience, and subsequently transform these lessons into personal growth and spiritual maturity. Ultimately, this transformative process guides them towards redemption and enlightenment, enabling them to transcend the burdens of their past and realize their highest potential.
