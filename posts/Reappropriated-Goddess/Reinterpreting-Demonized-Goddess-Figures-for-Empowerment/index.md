The correct answer is:
- The reinterpretation of a previously disregarded or demonized goddess figure through a contemporary, empowering lens

**Explanation**:

Reappropriated Goddess refers to the practice in modern occult and esoteric circles of rediscovering, reinterpreting, and, in some cases, rehabilitating previously disregarded or demonized goddess figures from various mythologies and cultures. The goal is to empower and reclaim the female principle, which has often been marginalized or distorted in the face of patriarchal cultural contexts.

Historically, many goddess figures have been vilified, demonized, or misrepresented due to the gradual shift towards patriarchal religions and cultures. An example is Lilith, who has been portrayed in the past as a demon or dark figure due to her associations with the night, sexuality, and independence. In recent times, she has been reinterpreted by some as a strong and empowering feminine symbol.

This reinterpretation is part of a larger movement within the occult and esoteric communities to not only rewrite the narrative around female deities but also challenge the male-dominated spiritual paradigms. Through the exploration and celebration of a Reappropriated Goddess, practitioners often aim to achieve personal empowerment, healing, and the expression of a more balanced and harmonious relationship between the masculine and feminine.

In contrast to the other options provided:

- An exclusively fictional character created by contemporary writers with no historical basis: This option is incorrect, as the Reappropriated Goddess involves engaging with historically or culturally significant goddess figures rather than creating entirely new ones.

- The complete rejection of a cultural or historical goddess figure and the creation of an entirely new one: While some modern occult practices involve the creation of new deities, the specific concept of a Reappropriated Goddess focuses on existing goddess figures and reinterpreting them through contemporary perspectives.

- The integration of patriarchal religious symbols into a new composite goddess figure: This option doesn't accurately describe the concept of a Reappropriated Goddess, as this practice focuses on the reinterpretation of existing goddess figures and their reclamation from patriarchal perspectives, rather than blending patriarchal symbols into the goddess figure.

In conclusion, the Reappropriated Goddess is a powerful concept in modern occult practices, as it seeks to reclaim and reimagine the divine feminine in an empowering and healing context. This can lead to a more balanced understanding of spirituality and promote harmony between the masculine and feminine energies in both individuals and cultures.
