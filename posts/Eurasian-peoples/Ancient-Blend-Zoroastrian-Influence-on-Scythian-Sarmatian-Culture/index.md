I sing of ancient lands and distant times,
Of valorous folk and hallowed ageless chimes,
Where mighty steeds and noble warriors roam,
And sacred fires in Zoroastrian homes.

In boundless steppes and vast Eurasian plains,
There dwelt the Scythians, a hardy race unchained,
The wandering folk, the Sarmatians famed,
And Parthians, whom the known world once named.

Their tales of ancestry and quests of old,
In sacred scrolls and whispered winds retold,
A tapestry of fates and legends weaved,
Of gods and men, their struggles to believe.

The cosmic battle twixt the light and dark,
And Ahura Mazda, the spark,
Of life and wisdom, guiding force so wise,
In Zoroastrian tenets would arise.

And thus, through trade and sword, a faith would spread,
Its teachings mingled with the words unsaid,
On Scythian graves were carvings made,
Of magi priests and solemn rites displayed.

In Sarmatian tribes, the matrons' reign,
Was lauded by their followers, sustained,
The noble dames, inspired by divine grace,
Built temples grand and led the sacred chase.

The Parthian kings, professing Mazda's light,
Would banish demons and the druj's foul blight,
Enlightened rulers forging vast empires,
Upward they soared on sacred pyres.

And from these unions, syncretism grew,
A vibrant culture, deep in colors, hue,
In art and craft, as tapestries were hung,
And blending tongues on Sarmatian lips sung.

The Parthian art in patterns intricate,
Of Zoroastrian symbols tightly knit,
Bearers of fire, the mighty Ahuras,
In golden frames and silver inlays glorious.

The Scythians, skilled in metalwork and war,
Would harness fire in worship to explore,
Their loyalty to heaven's holy fire,
A unifying force, to which they would aspire.

And politics reflected these exchanges,
Ideologies melded, boundaries rearranged,
Through war and peace, allegiances entwined,
A fresco painted to withstand all time.

Oh, let us celebrate this wondrous past,
Of ancient peoples, cultures unsurpassed,
Where Zoroastrianism and steppes did meet,
And birthed a harmony so bittersweet.
