The symbol is based on a circle, representing the eternal cycle of life and death - a concept found in various esoteric and occult traditions. Inside the circle, the Yin and Yang symbol will reside that demonstrates the innate balance of light and darkness, embodying the delicate interplay and eternal oscillation between these opposing forces.

The circle is surrounded by a trinity knot (from Celtic mythology) composed of three interlaced spirals, symbolizing the sacred number three in many esoteric and occult traditions. Each spiral represents different states - love, vulnerability, and fear - and the intertwining of these feelings showcases the complexities of both tenderness and terrors of life.

A large Ouroboros serpent is shown biting its tail, encircling the Yin and Yang symbol. In this context, it signifies the ebb and flow of energy throughout the universe, as well as the cyclicality of life and death. The snake's body undulates between being dark and light, mirroring the interplay of shadow and illumination found within the Yin and Yang symbol.

On top of the Yin and Yang, there is a heart. This emblem of love is shown as partially concealed and guarded by a skeleton hand, symbolizing vulnerability and the grip of fear that may hold onto our hearts. The fingers of the hand are adorned with an Eye of Horus (Wadjet), representing the protection of the divine and the ever-watchful gaze into the unknown.

Finally, beneath the Yin and Yang symbol, a crescent moon emerges, its inexorable orbit displaying the cyclical passage of time. It bears a small flame, alluding to the eternal interplay between light and darkness, embodying the constant connection and unity inherent to this dance of opposing forces.

In summary, the symbol incorporates elements representing love, vulnerability, fear, and the unknown, all woven together by motifs from various esoteric and occult traditions including the Yin and Yang, trinity knot, Ouroboros, Eye of Horus, and the crescent moon. This design captures the nuances and intricacies of the eternal oscillation between light and darkness, as well as the tender and terrifying aspects of life.
