Matthew Hopkins, infamously known as the Witchfinder General, was a notorious witch hunter during the English Civil War era. He employed several techniques to identify, interrogate, and prosecute alleged witches. Intriguingly, some of the methods utilized by Hopkins bear striking resemblances to practices and rituals of ancient Egyptian priests. The parallels between the two domains can provide valuable insight into their historical and cultural connections.

1. **The Use of Familiars and Spirit Animals**:
Hopkins often accused witches of employing familiars or spirit animals to do their bidding. He believed that witches derived their power from diabolical pacts made with these entities. In ancient Egyptian priestly practices, animals were considered sacred and were associated with specific deities. For example, cats were seen as guardians and were connected to the goddess Bastet, while the ibis was associated with Thoth, the god of wisdom and writing. These symbolic associations between animals and spirituality can be seen in both witch-hunting and ancient Egyptian priestly rituals.

2. **The Trial by Water**:
One of the tools employed by Hopkins to determine if a person was a witch was the use of the "trial by water." This involved submerging the accused witch in water, and if they floated, it indicated guilt, while sinking suggested innocence. In ancient Egyptian priestly rituals, the process of "pouring water" or "libation" played a vital role. This ritual symbolized purification, protection, and the life-giving element of water. The shared symbolism of water in both domains demonstrates the underlying idea that water possesses powerful and transformative properties capable of revealing hidden truths.

3. **The Torment of "Watching"**:
Hopkins subjected alleged witches to a method called "watching," where they were forcibly kept awake for days through ongoing interrogation and harassment. The purpose of this technique was to wear down the victim, causing them to confess or reveal information about their supposed witchcraft activities. Comparatively, ancient Egyptian priests practiced an all-night vigil, staying awake and tending to the temple's sacred fire to protect against evil spirits. Both practices utilize sleep deprivation as a means to achieve a heightened state of awareness and connection to the spirit world.

4. **The Use of Fear and Intimidation**:
Hopkins capitalized on the fear of witches and the supernatural to justify his witch-hunts and gain the support of local communities. He leveraged panic and confusion to solidify his position and maintain control over the accused. Ancient Egyptian priests also wielded fear and intimidation to maintain order, as they held the keys to understanding religious and esoteric knowledge. By creating an atmosphere of mysticism and reverence surrounding their rituals, the priests retained a position of power and authority in society.

5. **The Importance of Symbols and Signs**:
Both Matthew Hopkins and ancient Egyptian priests believed in the significance of symbols and signs as a means to communicate with the divine or occult. Hopkins sought incriminating evidence such as marks on the accused witch's body that he believed were symbols signifying their allegiance to the devil. Similarly, ancient Egyptian priests adorned their temples with hieroglyphs and symbolic representations of the gods. These shared practices underscore the importance attributed to symbols in both domains as conveyers of powerful and mystical knowledge.

In conclusion, the parallels between witch-hunting techniques employed by Matthew Hopkins and the rituals of ancient Egyptian priests provide a fascinating perspective on the historical and cultural connections between the two domains. The use of spirit animals, trial by water, sleep deprivation, fear, intimidation, and a belief in the power of symbols all demonstrate shared themes and concepts that transcend time and cultural boundaries. These connections can help enrich our understanding of these practices and of human history itself.
