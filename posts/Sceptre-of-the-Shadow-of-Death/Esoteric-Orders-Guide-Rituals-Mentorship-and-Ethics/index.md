## I. Initiation Rites and Ceremonies

1. Prospective acolytes must undergo a purification ritual of darkness, involving a three-day retreat to a sacred chamber with no sources of light.
2. Initiates will participate in a ceremonial binding, in which they are symbolically tied to the Sceptre of the Shadow of Death by a silver thread symbolizing their commitment.
3. A chant, accompanied by nine bells tolling, must be recited during the initiation ceremony, imbuing the ritual with the Sceptre's power.

### II. Conduct While Invoking the Sceptre's Energies

1. Ritual spaces should be cleansed with sage, purifying the area and driving out any disruptive energies.
2. Ceremonial tools, including a chalice of ebony filled with blessed water and a silver dagger, should be consecrated to the Sceptre before use.
3. Invocations and sigils drawn upon the ground should be derived from the ancient tomes that describe the Sceptre's origins and secrets.

### III. Disciplinary Actions for Transgressions

1. Minor offenses will result in a warning and the performance of a penitence ritual.
2. Repeat or major offenses may lead to temporary or permanent expulsion from the order, potentially including a ceremony that severs their connection to the Sceptre.
3. Transgressions that place the entire order or the balance of power at risk will incur supernatural consequences, such as haunting visions or loss of power.

### IV. Mentorship Program for Novices

1. Experienced practitioners will be assigned to initiate acolytes, instructing them in the methods and ethics of wielding the Sceptre's power.
2. Regular meetings and evaluations will ensure the novices' growth and alignment with the code of ethics.
3. Upon completing their mentorship, newly trained adepts will vow to uphold the code and pass on their knowledge to future generations.

### V. Alliances and Rivalries with Other Esoteric Organizations

1. Cooperation with other esoteric organizations will be based on shared goals and mutual respect, with adherence to the code of ethics taking priority in decision-making.
2. Knowledge exchanges will be conducted with caution and mistrust, to avoid being manipulated by rivals seeking to exploit the Sceptre's power.
3. Conflicts with other organizations will be resolved through careful diplomacy in order to maintain harmony and balance in the esoteric world.

### VI. Environmental Considerations

1. Ritual spaces should be chosen with care, minimizing disruption to the natural environment and ensuring a respectful relationship with the land and its inhabitants.
2. Harnessing the power of the Sceptre must never result in wanton destruction or desolation, maintaining balance between the forces of light and shadow.
3. Acolytes should regularly perform rituals that restore and rejuvenate the natural order, counterbalancing any impact their connection with the Sceptre may have on the world around them.
