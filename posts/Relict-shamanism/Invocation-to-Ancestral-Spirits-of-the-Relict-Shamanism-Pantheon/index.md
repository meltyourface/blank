excerpt: > 
  Compose an intricate prayer to invoke guidance from the ancient deities of the lesser-known Relict shamanism pantheon, specifically focusing on connecting with the spirits of the natural world and ancestral wisdom. Incorporate traditional chants, symbolic rituals, and the use of esoteric artifacts to enhance the depth and power of your supplication.

Oh ancient deities of the Relict shamanism pantheon, hear my call,
Spirits of the natural world and ancestral wisemen, to you I draw.

From the sacred relics with which I surround,
To the dusty earth that lies beneath the ground,
I invoke your power, guidance, and eldritch grace,
To weave between the realms and descend upon this place.

*Chants: Trelawi doran, kayema huroth*

By the circle of stones, 'neath the moon's full gleam,
I beseech thee, Oh Nari, Spirit of earth and stream.
From the deepest forests, where trees grow tall,
Spendraith, Whisperer of the winds, heed my call.

*Chants: Oletrei glazim, zormunthes voroth*

Ancient Aizar, whose fire's dance in the night,
Enkindle our deeds with your eternal light.
Mavra, Goddess of water, bless our paths untread,
As we traverse the rivers of knowledge, wide and deep.

*Chants: Korta mewelin, ixeri padron*

With my faithful bough of Revenwood in hand,
Connected through roots to this ancient land,
Through dances of yore, our ancestors' song,
Let spirit and mortal be united, an alliance lifelong.

I honor this hallowed ground and the spirits that reside,
Through the ever-burning incense of Sacred Nexus Pyre.
May our offerings of herbs and petrichor sage,
Drift to the celestial plains and entice their potent gaze.

*Chants: Duriel enkai, stolenthos phor*

In the shadows of the shaman's trance, we journey to seek,
The wisdom of the ancients, for the protection of the weak.
May their guidance and strength be our armor, our aid,
As we traverse the earthly realm, unafraid.

By the relics of old, the chants that resound,
And the sacred dance of the boundless around,
Oh spirits of the earth, air, fire, and tide,
Bestow upon us your essence, your secrets, confide.

Trelawi doran, kayema huroth,
Oletrei glazim, zormunthes voroth,
Korta mewelin, ixeri padron,
Duriel enkai, stolenthos phor.
