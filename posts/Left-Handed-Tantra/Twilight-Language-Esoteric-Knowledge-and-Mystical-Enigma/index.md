In the penumbra of concealed tongues,
The cryptic whispers of the twilight's edge,
A tapestry of symbols, woven, hung,
Revealing paths that gleam and images.

From shadows, allegories bloom like flowers,
Within each breath, a hundred secrets dwell,
Obscured by veils, in numbers we find powers,
The sacred code that tolls the mystic knell.

Chanting in tongues, beneath the crescent moon,
The sanguine dance of primordial birth,
A cryptic melody, a wistful tune,
We seek the wisdom of the hidden girth.

Abstruse, yet teeming with veracity,
A mirrored self, within the metaphor,
Reflections from the void's audacity,
Resplendent gems of knowledge, and much more.

Through palindrome and syllogism's fire,
In anaphora's sequential embrace,
The hidden truths, veiled in entrancing mire,
The twilight language offers us its grace.

Enigma's touch, adorned in numbers' dance,
From triple-six to sacred thirty-three,
A cosmic bond of secrets, through the trance,
In esoteric spells, the birth of glee.

The serpent climbs the spine in fluid steps,
Illuminating realms through piercing light,
In Sanskrit's hold, the twilight language creeps,
Eternal wisdom unfolds in the night.

In every symbol wrought with skillful hand,
And every number, bound to cosmic laws,
We find the keys to unlock hidden lands,
Venerating secrets, without pause.
