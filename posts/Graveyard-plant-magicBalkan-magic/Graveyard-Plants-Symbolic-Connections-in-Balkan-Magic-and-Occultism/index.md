In order to provide a comprehensive response to this knowledge challenge, I will first outline the traditional usage and symbolism of yew, cypress, and mugwort in Balkan magic practices and their associations in the wider context of occultism. Then, I will delve into the key differences and underlying principles that govern their application in these distinct frameworks.

1. Traditional Usage and Symbolism of Graveyard Plants in Balkan Magic Practices

a) Yew: The yew tree has a long-standing connection with death and the afterlife in Balkan magic. This association arises from the tree's incredibly long lifespan, its ability to regenerate new trunks from its base, and its evergreen nature. In Balkan folklore, the yew serves as a symbol of rebirth and transformation, while its red berries and sap are considered to have potent magical properties. It is common in rituals related to ancestor work, spirit communication, and protection against negative energies.

b) Cypress: Like the yew, cypress trees have significant associations with death and mourning in Balkan magic practices. Cypress trees are often planted in cemeteries to ward off malevolent spirits and to help guide the souls of the deceased to their final resting place. Cypress branches and leaves are used in purification, protection, and divination rituals, as well as for facilitating communication with the spirit world. The essential oil extracted from cypress is considered potent when it comes to invoking a sense of stability and grounding.

c) Mugwort: Though not as directly associated with death as yew and cypress, mugwort is a key plant in Balkan magical traditions. Mugwort serves as a visionary herb that facilitates intuitive insights and psychic abilities, particularly in regard to dream work and divination. In Balkan magic, mugwort is used to protect against negative energies, invoke prophetic dreams, and heighten one's connection to the spirit world.

2. Associations of Graveyard Plants in the Wider Context of Occultism

a) Yew: In the broader context of occultism, the yew tree occupies a similar position as a symbol of death and rebirth. The tree's long lifespan and regenerative properties also tie it to themes of immortality and the eternal cycle of life. Still, its parts can be highly toxic, which makes it a symbol of duality and balance since it represents both life and death. In Celtic and Norse mythology, the yew is associated with the Underworld and the goddesses of fate and death.

b) Cypress: Within the wider context of occultism, cypress symbolizes mourning and everlasting life due to its evergreen nature. In ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman cultures, the cypress tree was revered as a powerful symbol of the afterlife and was thought to provide protection and guidance for the deceased. Its branches were used in funerary rites, and the essential oil was believed to have healing properties.

c) Mugwort: In other occult traditions, mugwort also serves as a visionary herb and is associated with the Moon, dreams, and psychic energies. Mugwort is widely used for protection, purification, and the enhancement of psychic abilities in various magical traditions ranging from European witchcraft to Eastern shamanic practices.

3. Key Differences and Underlying Principles Governing Graveyard Plant Applications

The key differences between the traditional usage and symbolism of graveyard plants in Balkan magic and their associations in the wider context of occultism can be attributed to the region's unique cultural and historical influences. Local folklore, indigenous beliefs, and practices have shaped the specific associations and symbolic meanings of these plants within the Balkan magical framework.

However, there are also underlying similarities in the principles governing their applications across different magical and occult traditions. Graveyard plants like yew, cypress, and mugwort are universally revered for their mystical properties that facilitate communication with the spirit world, offer protection, and engender transformation and rebirth.

In summary, the traditional usage and symbolism of graveyard plants such as yew, cypress, and mugwort in Balkan magic practices share several similarities with their associations in the wider context of occultism, particularly regarding communication with the spirit world, protection, and transformation. Nevertheless, the unique cultural and historical influences of the Balkan region have also resulted in some differences in the symbolism and applications of these plants. Despite these differences, the underlying principles governing graveyard plant applications reveal shared themes and innate connections between different magical traditions worldwide.
