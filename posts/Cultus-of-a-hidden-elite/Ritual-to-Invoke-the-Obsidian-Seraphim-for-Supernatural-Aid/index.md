## Rite of the Obsidian Seraphim

**Objective**: Invoke the Obsidian Seraphim, a powerful and enigmatic entity, to assist the Cultus of the hidden elite in their secretive endeavors and further their aims.

**Timing**: The rite must be performed during the New Moon, when the celestial energies are most conducive to accessing the metaphysical.

Preparatory and Cleansing Procedures:

1. Purify all participants with a ritual bath infused with salts, essential oils of frankincense and myrrh, and rose petals, as well as ceremonial amulets made of obsidian.

2. Clean the ritual space meticulously, removing all traces of mundane influence and energy. This space should ideally be a secretive chamber or natural location such as a cave or grotto.

3. Create a large circular boundary with twelve obsidian stones, representing the Zodiac's influence over the metaphysical intricacies of reality.

4. Construct an altar in the center of the circle, adorned with black silk, alchemical symbols in silver ink, and a chalice filled with an elixir brewed from potent herbs and mineral essences.

Ritual Steps:

1. Gather all participants evenly around the obsidian circle. The lead practitioner, or Magister, should wear a ceremonial headdress made of raven feathers and hold a scepter of selenite topped with a polished obsidian sphere.

2. **The Magister begins by reciting the sacred invocation in the ancient tongue**: "Olthok ov nin-aki, ortgahad Gara-nu, Obsidian Seraphim, kula-nai."

3. All participants join the Magister, channeling their energies toward the center of the circle. **They recite the sacred chant in unison**: "Ashma, rozak, zilvren, nemora, Obsidian Seraphim, sulmani tola vahra."

4. The ritual participants perform the Trance of the Serpent, a series of intricate gestures including long sweeping arm movements, spiraling steps, and gentle undulations, akin to the hypnotic movements of a serpent.

5. The Magister raises the Selenite Scepter overhead, invoking the cosmic energies of the New Moon to permeate the ritual space.

6. Simultaneously, all participants draw on their personal talismans (either engraved pendants or rings) to capture the focused energies, rendering them accessible to their mysterious patron.

7. The rite culminates with the Magister offering the sacred elixir to the Obsidian Seraphim, an act of devotion and a symbol of the covenant between the entity and the Cultus.

8. Finally, all practitioners bow in unison to signify their allegiance and appreciation for the Obsidian Seraphim's guidance and potency.

Closing and Revelations:

1. As the Obsidian Seraphim manifests within the ritual space, the gathering should anticipate an immediate shift in the atmosphere. Shadows may deepen, and the air itself might possess a faint electric charge.

2. The Seraphim will convey its wisdom and intentions telepathically to the Magister. The Magister, in turn, will relay the pertinent information and instructions concerning the aims and objectives of the Cultus to all assembled.

3. The Magister closes the rite by expressing gratitude to the Obsidian Seraphim, and gradually, the circle's powerful presence will dissipate, the ritual space returning to its default state.

4. All participants proceed to document and discuss the experience and instructions received, ensuring the order remains focused and aligned with its overarching destiny according to the inscrutable designs of the Obsidian Seraphim.
