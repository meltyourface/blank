Answering this knowledge challenge requires a comprehensive understanding of various esoteric and occult principles, symbolism, and archetypal theories propagated in both Western and Eastern schools of thought. A synthesis of these diverse elements into a transformative curriculum aimed at guiding a seeker towards self-realization and the ultimate attainment of gnosis should be our primary objective.

We will approach this challenge in the following steps:
1. Identifying key principles and aspects from Western esoteric and occult traditions.
2. Identifying key principles and aspects from Eastern esoteric and occult traditions.
3. Synthesizing and integrating these principles into a comprehensive curriculum.

1. **Key principles and aspects from Western esoteric and occult traditions**:

a. ****Hermeticism****: This tradition focuses on the principle of correspondence ("As above, so below"), which posits that the macrocosm and microcosm are reflections of each other. Incorporating this principle into the curriculum will encourage students to explore the interconnected nature of reality and its role in self-realization.

b. ****Kabbalah****: This Jewish mysticism emphasizes the importance of the Tree of Life, which represents the divine archetypal framework and the path towards spiritual enlightenment. Understanding the Tree of Life's ten Sephirot (divine attributes) and the 22 paths that connect them will be incorporated into the curriculum.

c. ****Alchemy****: This discipline offers a symbolic language for spiritual transformation, employing concepts like the philosopher's stone, the alchemical marriage, and the transmutation of base metals into gold as metaphors for inner transformation and the attainment of gnosis.

d. ****Tarot****: Often categorized as an occult practice, the tarot's major and minor arcana provide an insightful system of symbols that represents initiatory stages, archetypal energies, and the journey of the soul.

2. **Key principles and aspects from Eastern esoteric and occult traditions**:

a. ****Hinduism and Yoga****: The concept of the Atman (True Self) as the divine spark within each individual and the idea of Moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death) are central to this tradition. Incorporating these principles along with the practices of Yoga (such as Hatha, Raja, and Jnana) into the curriculum will facilitate spiritual growth and self-realization.

b. ****Buddhism****: Integrating principles such as The Four Noble Truths, The Eightfold Path, and the concept of achieving enlightenment by transcending the illusion of self (Anatta) will help seekers develop a deeper understanding of the nature of suffering, impermanence, and the path towards liberation.

c. ****Taoism****: Emphasizing the principle of living in harmony with the Tao (the natural flow or way of the universe), and integrating practices like meditation, martial arts, and herbalism into the curriculum can help seekers harmonize their consciousness with the underlying order of existence.

3. **Synthesizing and integrating these principles into a comprehensive curriculum**:

The curriculum should begin with a foundational course exploring the history and core concepts of the various Western and Eastern esoteric and occult traditions. As students advance, coursework should delve deeper into the discrete principles and practices detailed above, allowing them to effectively analyze and synthesize the common threads and unique elements of each tradition.

Courses on initiation and self-realization should be designed to impart practical tools for transformation, such as meditation, visualization, ritual, and contemplative inquiry. Periodic assessments or challenges can gauge the student's progress while facilitating introspection and personal growth.

In conclusion, developing a comprehensive, contextually-integrated, and transformative curriculum for a correspondence course in the esoteric and occult requires a careful synthesis of core principles and practices from both Western and Eastern schools of thought. By integrating both historical and practical lessons, students will embark on a journey of self-discovery and spiritual illumination, culminating in the attainment of gnosis.
