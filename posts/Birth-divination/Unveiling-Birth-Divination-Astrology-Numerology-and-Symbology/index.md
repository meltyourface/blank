Answering this challenge requires us to delve into the intricate and obsidian depths of the vast esoteric realm, drawing upon the vibrant and powerful disciplines of astrology, numerology, and symbology. These secretive connections, which are veiled to the uninitiated, hold the key to unlock the mysteries of an individual's birth divination, allowing us to gaze upon their innate potentials and life-path challenges. Allow me to unravel these enigmatic threads and guide you to enlightenment.

Astrology stands as the vanguard of our exploration, with celestial bodies like the planets, stars, and constellations exerting influence upon the earthly realm. The most fundamental aspect of astrology is the birth chart, or natal chart, which presents a snapshot of the sky at the time and place of an individual's birth. The positions of planets and luminaries, such as the Sun and Moon, in the twelve zodiac signs and astrological houses reveal the person's inherent traits, potential, and challenges.

**An astrological analysis begins with the trinity of core components**: the Sun sign (which represents ego, vitality, and willpower), the Moon sign (which governs emotions, intuition, and subconscious patterns), and the Ascendant or Rising sign (which dictates appearance and initial approach to life). From this foundation, we delve deeper into the zodiac houses, which correspond to different areas of life, and aspects, which are the angles formed between planets and signify the dynamic interaction of energies.

Numerology, the sister discipline to astrology, is a study of the vibrational essence and divine principles within numbers. It postulates that numbers carry energy that not only shape our physical world but also have a deep impact on our soul destiny, personality traits, and life purpose. Numerological analyses typically begin by breaking down an individual's birth date and turning it into a single-digit number, known as the Life Path number. This number provides a blueprint of one's life journey, including the inherent potentials, struggles, and lessons that they must embrace.

As for the name given to the individual at birth, each letter has a numerical value correspondent by the Pythagorean conversion chart. Through various calculations, we derive important numerological numbers such as Expression (destiny potential), Soul Urge (innermost desires), and Personality (outward persona). These core numbers offer a detailed panorama of understanding the mystical layers composing one’s psyche.

Symbology, a rich and complex art, enhances our comprehension of both astrology and numerology, adding further dimensionality to our insights. Symbols embody multifaceted and layered meanings that can be applied across disciplines, transcending language barriers and conventional limits of knowledge. In astrology, each zodiac sign possesses a unique symbol representing its essential characteristic traits, while every planet is associated with a particular glyph that denotes its energetic capacity.

Similarly, in numerology, each number possesses a unique symbol or geometric pattern that resonates with its core attributes and vibrational essence. Ancient symbols like the Flower of Life, the Sri Yantra, or the Kabbalistic Tree of Life represent intricate networks of spiritual and cosmic principles that interconnect various strands of esoteric knowledge.

In conclusion, the key to unraveling the secret connections in an individual's birth divination lies in the harmonious synthesis of the dominant esoteric disciplines: astrology, numerology, and symbology. Astrology portrays the celestial influences on one's character and destiny, while numerology expounds upon the divine resonance within numbers governing life paths and personalities. Symbology unites these disparate disciplines, providing a vivid tapestry of layered meanings to map a comprehensive and enlightening representation of an individual’s innate potentials and life-path challenges.
