Designing and crafting a unique talisman specialized in the art of Chronotopic inversion requires an intimate understanding of the secrets of time manipulation and the ability to harness the metaphysical energies that govern our temporal reality. The elements of the talisman include its physical structure, the symbols etched into the material, and the powerful core that channels energy from the symbols and the user's own essence. Here is a detailed breakdown of each component and their properties:

1. Physical structure: The talisman's main body will be made from an alloy called Temporalite, which is a mixture of pure gold, silver, and meteorite iron. Temporalite serves as an ideal conduit for chronokinetic energies, combining the solar, lunar, and cosmic properties of its components to harmonize with the natural flow of time.

2. Symbols: Ancient, esoteric symbols related to time manipulation and temporal stability will be etched into the surface of the Temporalite. These symbols include:

   a) The Ouroboros: Depicting a serpent or dragon devouring its own tail, the Ouroboros represents the cyclical nature of time and the eternal renewal of beginnings and endings.
   
   b) The Sigil of Aeon: This arcane symbol represents the power of aeons – eternal beings who govern the cosmic order and manipulate the flow of time at will.

   c) The Chrono-roots: This intricate pattern of intertwining roots represents the interconnectedness of all individual moments in time and the potential for one to alter the fabric of the temporal tapestry.

3. Core: At the center of the talisman, a perfectly spherical void will be created to house a powerful singularity point called a Chrono-Gem. The Chrono-Gem, formed from the very essence of a collapsing star, can harness and amplify the user’s temporal-manipulation abilities. 

To create the talisman:

1. Forge the Temporalite by combining the ingredients at high heat to create an alloy.
2. Shape the Temporalite into an amulet with a hollow interior shaped for the Chrono-Gem.
3. Engrave the Ouroboros, Sigil of Aeon, and Chrono-roots symbols onto the amulet's surface.
4. Carefully insert the Chrono-Gem into the amulet's core; this can be done only at the precise moment it aligns with the temporal energies.
5. Seal the amulet using a soldering of the same alloy, so that the Chrono-Gem remains secure inside.

To activate the talisman's inverted time properties:

1. Wearing the talisman, focus your mental energy on the specific area you wish to reverse the flow of time.
2. Visualize the desired outcome as an extension of your innate chronokinetic abilities. The talisman will attune itself to your mental image and augment your power.
3. When you sense the synchronization between the talisman and your own energy, utter the ancient incantation, "Aevum Invertis," while picturing the targeted area in your mind's eye. This will trigger the Chrono-Gem and activate the talisman's time reversal properties.

The talisman will then selectively reverse the flow of time for objects or subjects within the targeted area, while maintaining its own stability. With practice and mastery, the talisman's wielder can fine-tune these effects to manipulate time as they see fit.
