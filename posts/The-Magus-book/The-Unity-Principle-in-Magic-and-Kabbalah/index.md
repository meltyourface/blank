Passage from The Magus (book) by Francis Barrett:

"From hence proceed the most occult and secret wonders of the art of magic. The sum of these things will become the principles of the cabala; for every disease inflicted upon the members of the body of man proceedeth from the unity of the substance of that body; so unity subsists in identity; for identity being taken away, nothing remains, and we are annihilated."

Contemporary translation:

"From this point, the most hidden and mysterious aspects of the art of magic emerge. These elements will form the foundation of the Kabbalah. Every ailment that affects the human body originates from the core essence of that body; unity exists in the identity itself. If identity is lost, then everything disappears, and we cease to exist."

**Analysis**:

Within this passage, Francis Barrett delves into the esoteric concept of unity in identity and its connection to the art of magic and Kabbalah. In the original archaic language, the passage may seem dense and convoluted for modern readers, however, updating it to contemporary language makes it easier to understand and appreciate.

In modern-day occult understanding, unity refers to the interconnectedness of all beings and the idea that everything is connected to a collective consciousness. This principle has widespread influence in occult teachings, spanning from ancient times to present practices like chaos magic and contemporary witchcraft. In translating this, it's essential to maintain the original depth and scope that Barrett attributed to unity, as well as highlighting the importance of identity in shaping mankind's existence.

The passage also touches upon the Kabbalah and its connection to unity and identity. Kabbalah, a foundation in many esoteric schools of thought, is an intricate study of the laws of the universe in relation to spiritual growth and human understanding. It is crucial to acknowledge the relevance of this concept to modern practices, as its influence can be found in contemporary occult literature and practices.

Furthermore, the passage connects this principle of unity to human health, suggesting that ailments stem from a disturbance in the unity of the body's substance. In a modern context, this idea can be linked to the importance of maintaining balance and connection within ourselves and with the world around us, as a key aspect of holistic health and well-being. Thus, the translation and interpretation of this passage provide valuable insights applicable in both historical and present-day esoteric knowledge and practices.
