For this analysis and in-depth evaluation, I have chosen the contemporary representation and adaptation of Rúne magic in the popular television series "Shadowhunters." The show is set around a group of warriors, known as Shadowhunters, who battle demons and supernatural threats to protect the human world. The Shadowhunters use Rúne magic extensively, as it is a crucial aspect of their fight against the demonic forces.

Accuracy and Authenticity of Runic Symbols:
In "Shadowhunters," Rúne magic involves using runes, which are symbols with magical properties that confer specific abilities or powers when drawn onto a Shadowhunter's skin. While the series uses various Rúne symbols that take inspiration from Norse and Germanic origins, there is creative liberty taken in their designs. The runes depicted are often visually appealing but do not adhere strictly to the historically authentic runic script systems like Elder Futhark or Younger Futhark.

Rituals and Spellcasting Techniques:
The rituals and spellcasting techniques used in "Shadowhunters" are heavily simplified, primarily serving as a plot device rather than a comprehensive portrayal of true Rúne magic. Typically, a Shadowhunter merely mutilates their stele (a magical wand) to etch the rune onto their skin, and the magic activates instantaneously. This portrayal omits the deeper intricacies of traditional rune casting like using incantations and focal points of energy or the need for detailed understanding and preparation of runic symbols.

Historical and Cultural Context:
In ancient Nordic and Germanic cultures, Rúne magic held deep symbolism, spiritual significance, and required thorough knowledge of the runes, their meanings, and their relationships with one another. Rune magic was often used as a means to achieve personal transformation, divine insight, or commune with the gods. These elements are not noticeably present in the "Shadowhunters" series, as the focus is primarily on the practical, combat-oriented applications of runic magic.

Comparing Ancient and Modern Interpretations:
The historical Rúne magic was more versatile and profound than its portrayal in "Shadowhunters." Instead of merely mundane and combative uses, historical practitioners wielded the power of runes to acquire wisdom, foresee the future, and attain spiritual growth.

Creative Improvements and Innovations:
To enhance the connection between the contemporary representation of Rúne magic in "Shadowhunters" and its ancient foundations, the following improvements and innovations could be considered:

1. Introduce more historically accurate runic symbols: This would provide authenticity and foster an opportunity to educate viewers about the true origins of rune magic.

2. Incorporate deeper rituals and incantations: Adding verses from historical Rúne poems or Eddas, which invoke the magical energy of runes, could lend an engaging mystique and complexity to the modern practice.

3. Highlight multifaceted nature of Rúne magic: Showcasing aspects like divination, personal transformation, and spiritual growth alongside practical uses can create richer world-building and character development.

4. Explore diverse cultural influences: Delve into Rúne magic's roots in Celtic, Slavic, and other cultures, thereby expanding the magical practice's depth and broadening its storytelling potential.

In conclusion, the contemporary representation of Rúne magic in "Shadowhunters" serves its narrative purposes but could benefit from a closer connection to its historical and cultural origins. By incorporating elements of authentic runic symbols, rituals, and the multifaceted nature of traditional Rúne magic, the mystical world of the series could become even more enchanting and engaging for viewers.
