Task: Develop a highly intricate sigil embodying the sacred essence of the Neophyte's secret word, designed to manifest specific intention within the realm of esoteric knowledge and occult practices.

In order to create this intricate sigil, I will begin by choosing a specific intention. For this sigil, the focus will be on enhancing one's innate connection to the esoteric wisdom and divine knowledge of the universe to guide their path on their journey. With this intention in mind, let's proceed with the sigil crafting.

1. **Symbols and elements selection**: Lavish symbolism is essential to any sigil. For this sigil, several symbols will be used to represent the different aspects of the intention. **Key symbols include**:
  
  - The mighty Eye of Horus, as a symbol of protection and divine knowledge
  - The alchemical symbol for Earth, which represents grounding in sacred wisdom
  - A Caduceus, symbolizing the awakening of spiritual energy and balance within oneself
  - The mystical Ouroboros, embodying the cycles of growth and self-transformation

2. **Numerology**: Sacred numbers will be incorporated into this sigil for further significance. **Relevant numbers include**:

  - The number 7, signifying inner growth and spiritual awakening
  - The number 11, representing mastery, illumination, and spiritual growth

These numbers will be represented within the design as the number of points, angles, or encircling lines.

3. **Sacred geometry**: Careful incorporation of sacred geometry will enhance the sigil's potency. **Elements of sacred geometry include**:

  - A hexagram or six-pointed star, to denote the merging of the above and below- the divine and earthly
  - A Metatron's Cube, symbolizing interconnectedness and unity among all elements of creation

4. **Ancient sigil-crafting techniques**: Employing techniques from classical grimoires and occult systems such as the Key of Solomon and Enochian magic will lend further power to the sigil.

5. **Personal significance and ritualistic elements**: To fully potentiate this sigil, elements of personal significance and ritualistic components will be woven into the design and also used in the charging process:

  - A personal rune, symbol, or sigil that resonates with the practitioner's inner self
  - A carefully chosen and consecrated ritual space to charge and empower the sigil

By combining the symbols, sacred geometry, numerology, ancient techniques, and elements of personal significance, a highly intricate sigil embodying the essence of the Neophyte's secret word and manifesting esoteric knowledge will be constructed.

Remember that each person's sigil will vary in appearance based on their personal symbols and connections, but the sigil's core principles of wisdom, growth, and connection will remain the same.

Upon completion of the sigil's design, it is essential to perform proper activation and charging rituals, such as meditation, visualization, or invocation, to attain the intended results. The key is to remain mindful of the sacred essence and powerful intention the sigil represents on your journey through esoteric knowledge and unique self-discovery.
