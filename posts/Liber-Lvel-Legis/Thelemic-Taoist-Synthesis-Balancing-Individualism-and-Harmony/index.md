The task at hand is to investigate the potential merging of Thelemic principles, as outlined in Liber Lvel Legis, with the core tenets of Taoism, a spiritual and philosophical system originating from ancient China. By delving into the harmonization and contradictions that might arise during this synthesis, we shall explore the possible advantages and disadvantages stemming from this amalgamation.

Thelemic Principles:
Liber Lvel Legis, also known as The Book of the Law, is the central sacred text of Thelema, a spiritual philosophy founded by Aleister Crowley. It espouses the idea that each individual has a unique purpose or "True Will" that must be understood and pursued. **Some key principles in Thelema include the following**:

1. **"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" (AL I**:40)
2. "Love is the law, love under will" (AL I:57)
3. **"Every man and every woman is a star" (AL I**:3)

Taoist Principles:
Taoism is an ancient Chinese spiritual and philosophical tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, or "the way." The Tao is the source of creation and the flow of life, and Taoist principles generally prioritize simplicity, living in accordance with nature, and self-cultivation. **Some key principles in Taoism include**:

1. Wu-wei (effortless action/going with the flow)
2. Yin and yang (the balance of opposites)
3. The Three Treasures (compassion, frugality, and humility)

Harmonization and Contradictions:
Both Thelema and Taoism share an understanding that a natural order exists, and adherents are encouraged to follow this order to achieve a fulfilled and purposeful life.

1. The Thelemic concept of "True Will" is similar to Taoism's idea of wu-wei, as both advocate for aligning oneself with the natural flow of the universe, albeit through different methods.

2. The Thelemic principle of "Love is the law, love under will" could find resonance with the Taoist emphasis on compassion as one of the Three Treasures.

However, there are considerable differences that may pose challenges in merging these two systems:

1. Thelema promotes individualism and self-realization, while Taoism values humility and simplicity. This distinction in focus may create tension in harmonizing the two philosophies.

2. Thelema's moral relativism and dynamic stance on ethics may clash with traditional Taoist ethics, particularly when considering the importance of virtues such as humility and frugality.

Advantages of Amalgamation:
1. Practitioners could benefit from an enriched spiritual understanding as they seek to find their True Will through the lens of Taoist self-cultivation, embracing the interconnectedness of their individual paths with the greater cosmic order.

2. The integration of both systems could inspire personal growth and transformation through the cultivation of virtues and principles from both Thelema and Taoism.

Disadvantages of Amalgamation:
1. The inherent differences between Thelemic and Taoist principles could lead to confusion and doctrinal conflicts, as personal ethics, self-realization, and the pursuit of the True Will may not always align with Taoist virtues and practices.

2. The amalgamation of these two systems could dilute their unique identities, possibly detracting from their individual strengths and distinct perspectives on spirituality.

In conclusion, while the merging of Thelemic and Taoist principles would indeed present opportunities for an enriched spiritual understanding, the potential challenges and conflicts arising from such synthesis must be critically examined and approached with care. Ultimately, the practitioner must decide whether this amalgamation enhances or hinders their spiritual growth, finding their own balance between the principles espoused by these two traditions.
