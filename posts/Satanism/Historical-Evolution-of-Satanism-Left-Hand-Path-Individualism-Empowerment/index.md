To explore the intrinsic relationship between the individualistic philosophy of Satanism and the historical development of modern Left-Hand Path practices, we must first understand the basic concepts and definitions associated with these belief systems. 

Satanism is a set of diverse, individualistic beliefs, ideologies, and practices generally centered around the figure of Satan or similar rebellious and adversarial figures. The Left-Hand Path represents a group of various spiritual practices and beliefs that challenge orthodox religious traditions and social norms, seeking to discover the divine primarily through self-exploration and self-deification. 

Now, let us delve into the historical development of modern Left-Hand Path practices and their relation to the individualistic philosophy of Satanism.

The roots of the Left-Hand Path can be traced back to ancient Indian Tantra practices and the concept of Vamachara, which translates to the "left-handed-path." Tantra was a spiritual discipline focused on developing one's personal power and spiritual liberation. It encouraged self-empowerment and a quest for knowledge, similar to the later Satanic themes of individualism.

In the Western world, the modern Left-Hand Path emerged in response to the dominant Judeo-Christian narratives, opposing the established religious dogma. A key figure in this development was the French occultist, Eliphas Lévi, who popularized the idea of "Baphomet" in the 19th century as a symbol of rebellion and an embodiment of opposites. Lévi’s work paved the way for occultists and mystics to explore boundless individual potential and challenged the existing views of divinity.

Moving into the 20th century, Satanism and the Left-Hand Path further diversified with influential figures like Aleister Crowley, who founded the religion of Thelema, emphasizing the importance of discovering one's "True Will" and the pursuit of personal freedom. **Crowley's philosophy was based on the maxim**: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This idea resonated with Satanic beliefs in individualism and self-discovery.

The Church of Satan represents a prominent example of Satanic thought's evolution and its connection with the Left-Hand Path. Founded by Anton LaVey in 1966, it espouses the tenets of rational self-interest, individualism, and egoism, as detailed in the Satanic Bible. LaVeyan Satanism is atheistic and promotes the pursuit of personal freedom, self-discovery, and embracing human nature.

Key themes that connect the individualistic philosophy of Satanism with the historical development of modern Left-Hand Path practices include:

1. Rejection of orthodox religious traditions and social norms.
2. Focus on self-exploration, empowerment, and spiritual liberation.
3. Embracing the dualities and opposites in human nature.
4. The pursuit of personal freedom and self-discovery.

In analyzing the socio-cultural implications of Satanism and the Left-Hand Path, we observe the following:

1. **Independence from religious dogma**: As these belief systems reject traditional religious narratives, they promote independent thinking and a break from adhering to societal norms for their followers.

2. **Empowerment and self-actualization**: The individualistic philosophy of Satanism and Left-Hand Path practices inspire personal growth, self-realization, and actualization of one's potential, often through self-reflection, creative expression, and the pursuit of knowledge.

3. **Tolerance and diversity**: Due to its non-dogmatic nature, Satanism and Left-Hand Path practices have the potential to foster spiritual tolerance and diversity, as they allow the individual to explore and adapt belief systems to their unique inclinations and interests.

In conclusion, the individualistic philosophy of Satanism is intrinsically connected to the historical development of modern Left-Hand Path practices. Key influences like Eliphas Lévi, Aleister Crowley, and Anton LaVey provided frameworks that supported individualism, self-exploration, and personal freedom. Socio-cultural implications of these belief systems include independence from religious dogma, empowerment and self-actualization, and the promotion of tolerance and diversity.
