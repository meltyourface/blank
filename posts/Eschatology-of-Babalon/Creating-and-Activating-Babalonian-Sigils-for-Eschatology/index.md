Creating and activating occult sigils specifically tailored to the Eschatology of Babalon involves a multi-step process, whereby you first design the sigil using relevant symbols, numerology, and color correspondences, and then activate it through ritual. Here's a comprehensive guide to creating and activating a Babalonian sigil.

1. Intent and Research
Begin by defining the intention you wish to manifest. This intention should align with the sacred mysteries of Babalon, such as personal transformation, spiritual awakening, or divine union. Next, research symbols, numerology, and color correspondences associated with Babalon in order to create a sigil that reflects your intention.

2. Selecting Symbols and Creating the Sigil
Choose appropriate symbols or sigils that directly correspond with Babalon, such as the Chalice, the Holy Grail, the Seven-pointed Star, or the Seal of Babalon. Incorporate these symbols into the design of your sigil, paying attention to aesthetics and balance. 

3. Numerology
Incorporate numerology into your sigil, focusing on numbers that resonate with the energy of Babalon. Examples of these can be the sacred numbers 49 (7x7), 156 (the numerological value of the name Babalon), and 418 (the number associated with the Great Work in the Thelemic system). Use these numbers in the design of your sigil, either as shapes, the number of lines or curves, or as a mathematical formula that determines the sigil's proportions.

4. Color Correspondences
Select colors that carry the energies of Babalon. These colors should reflect the essence of your intention and also correspond with Babalon's energy. Traditional colors associated with Babalon include crimson, gold, and green. Utilize these colors to enhance the visual aspects of your sigil.

5. Activating the Sigil
Once you have designed your sigil, it's essential to activate it through a ritualistic process. **This involves several steps**:

a. **Purify and Consecrate**: Cleanse your space and yourself with a ritual bath, incense, or smudging. Consecrate your sigil by anointing it with handcrafted oil, visualizing its purpose.

b. **Opening a Sacred Space**: Create an altar dedicated to Babalon, where you will perform the ritual. You may incorporate candles, incense, flowers, and other symbols of Babalon to enhance the energy of your sacred space.

c. **Invoke Babalon's Presence**: Perform invocations or prayers to Babalon, asking for Her guidance, assistance, and power to align with the intention of your sigil. 

d. **Meditation and Visualization**: Meditate on the sigil, focusing on your intention and visualizing the outcome as if it's already manifested. This process charges the sigil with energy and connects it to the universal web of creation, thereby starting the process of manifesting your intention.

e. **Offerings**: Offer appropriate libations or offerings to Babalon as a means of gratitude and reciprocity.

f. **Closing the Ritual**: Thank Babalon for Her assistance and presence in your ritual. Close your sacred space by expressing gratitude for the experience and formally closing the ritual with a phrase such as, "So mote it be" or "It is done."

6. Sigil Disposal or Preservation
Depending on the nature of the sigil and its purpose, you may choose to preserve the sigil by keeping it somewhere safe or disposing of it in a respectful manner once the intention has manifested. Fire and water are traditional conduits to release the energy stored within activated sigils back into the universe.

By following this intricate process, you will create and activate a powerful occult sigil specifically tailored to the Eschatology of Babalon, harnessing its arcane energy and manifesting your highest intentions in alignment with Babalon's sacred mysteries.
