This act symbolizes the fusing of the sacred feminine, embodied by the Priestess as Babalon, with the purifying and transformative force of Fire.

Additionally, the practice of sex magick rituals in Thelemic traditions often seeks to harness the generative, transformative power of Fire as symbolized by Babalon. The practitioners engage in these rituals with the intent of awakening the dormant, fiery power within themselves and achieving a heightened state of spiritual awareness, ultimately culminating in the revelation of one's divine purpose and True Will.
