Ritual for Curse Removal: Liberatio Ex Maledictum

Materials Required:
1. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - for purification and protection
2. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) - for dispelling negativity and healing
3. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) - for sequestering and neutralizing dark energies
4. Angelica Root (Angelica archangelica) - for forming a divine barrier against evil forces
5. Vervain (Verbena officinalis) - for amplifying the power of other herbs and enhancing energy flow

Preparation of Curse-Lifting Tea Blend:
1. Gather equal portions of the five herbs listed above, ideally during the waxing moon phase for the most potent effect.
2. Dry the herbs in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated area for about one or two weeks, or until crumbly and brittle.
3. Crush or grind the dried herbs into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, imbuing your intentions of curse-breaking with each movement.
4. Store the finely ground blend in an opaque, airtight container, placing it in a sacred place until itâ€™s time to perform the curse removal ritual.

Ritual Steps:
1. Begin by setting up an altar or sacred space dedicated to protection and healing. Include objects and elements that symbolize strength, resilience, and purification, such as candles, crystals, and protective charms.
2. Prepare a new moon bath by adding the curse-lifting tea blend to a small pot of boiling water. Allow it to steep for at least ten minutes, letting the infusion of the five herbs imbue the water with their full spiritual power.
3. Strain the tea into a cup, ritually charging it by visualizing a bright light surrounding the liquid. Declare your intention to remove the curse from yourself or another person and invite any benevolent spirits or guides to aid you in the process.
4. As you chant the following incantation, hold your dominant hand over the brewed tea and envision a powerful, golden light emanating from your palm, filling the cup with its purifying energy:

"By the elements of earth and air,
Bring forth protection, strength, and care.
With the power of water and fire,
Break this curse that's undesired.
With the power of this sacred tea,
As I will it, so mote it be."

5. Slowly sip the tea, visualizing the concoction's potent energy coursing through your body, dispelling the negative forces or energies attached to you. Take deep breaths with each sip, maintain the visualization, and continue to recite the incantation.
6. Upon finishing the tea, express your gratitude to the benevolent spirits and guides who assisted in the ritual. Close the ceremony by saying:

"Thank you, herbs and spirits divine,
For lifting the curse and making it all right.
With gratitude and love in my heart,
This ritual is complete, we now part."

(Optional) Perform a cleansing ritual in the subsequent days for added protection, such as burning sage, using protective crystals, or reciting affirmative prayers.

Follow this ritual with dedication, diligence, and deep focus to ensure the effective removal of any lingering curses. Remember that intent and conviction are essential components in manifesting this ceremony's potent results.
