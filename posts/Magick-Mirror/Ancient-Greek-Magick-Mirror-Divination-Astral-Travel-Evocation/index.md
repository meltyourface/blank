The Greek Magical Papyri (PGM) are an invaluable collection of texts dating back to the 2nd century BCE. They contain a wealth of information on the magical and spiritual practices of the ancient Mediterranean world, as well as a myriad of mythological elements. In this analysis, we will focus on the esoteric and occult aspects of the Magick Mirror mentioned within the PGM, along with deities, entities, and rituals.

Mythological Aspects:
Many elements of Greek mythology are encompassed within the PGM. Deities such as Hekate, Hermes, and Helios are frequently mentioned in connection with various aspects of magical practices. These deities often serve as intermediaries, guiding the practitioner through their spiritual journey.

Magick Mirror:
The Magick Mirror is an ancient tool used for divination and reflection on the self and the universe. It acts as a conduit between the physical and metaphysical worlds. Within the Greek Magical Papyri, the Magick Mirror is associated with astral travel, scrying, and evocation. Its use is intricately connected with several deities, mainly the moon goddess Selene, who is associated with the Magick Mirror in various rituals.

Deities and Entities:
1. **Selene**: As the moon goddess, Selene is closely linked to the Magick Mirror's divinatory powers. Rituals invoking her presence often involve scrying through the mirror in order to gain prophetic visions and access to hidden realms. 

2. **Hekate**: This powerful threefold goddess plays a crucial role in many magic spells and rituals. Her presence within the PGM is frequently linked to the Magick Mirror, especially in rituals focused on protection, transformation, and guidance. 

3. **Hermes**: In his capacity as a psychopomp, Hermes is invoked in conjunction with the Magick Mirror to facilitate communication with spirits and otherworldly beings. He is also connected to the practice of evoking daimones, who serve as guides and allies for the practitioner.

**Rituals**:
Several rituals and incantations found within the PGM involve the Magick Mirror. **These can be divided into specific categories**:

1. **Divination**: The Magick Mirror is often used for scrying, a method of divination that involves gazing into a reflective surface to gain knowledge or insight. Rituals related to divination usually involve the practitioner invoking a deity, like Selene, who assists in the process of revealing hidden knowledge.

2. **Astral Travel**: The Magick Mirror is believed to be a portal to otherworldly realms, and thus, many rituals found in the PGM involve its use to facilitate astral travel. This practice allows the magician to explore different planes of existence and encounter various spiritual beings.

3. **Evocation**: The Magick Mirror can be employed in rituals to evoke deities, daimones, or other spiritual entities. These beings often serve as allies, providing the practitioner with guidance, protection, or assistance in magical workings.

Synergies with Spells, Incantations, and Talismanic Designs:
The Magick Mirror can be integrated with other magical tools and practices found in the PGM to enhance its effects. For instance, combining elemental rituals or using the mirror alongside specific talismans might amplify and direct the energies invoked during the practice. By invoking a specific deity in conjunction with the mirror, one can tailor the divination or magical practice to a particular type of energy or purpose.

In conclusion, the Greek Magical Papyri provide essential insights into the esoteric and occult aspects of the Magick Mirror, highlighting its versatility as a tool for divination, astral travel, and evocation. The extensive mythological elements, along with numerous deities, entities, and rituals, serve to emphasize the complexity and richness of the Magick Mirror's symbolic significance. By exploring and incorporating these elements, a practitioner can harness the full potential of this enigmatic tool, unlocking its depths and weaving a tapestry of interconnected magical practices.
