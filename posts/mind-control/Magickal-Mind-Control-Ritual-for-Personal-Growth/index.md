1. Preparatory Phase:

a. Purification of the ritual space: Begin by burning a cleansing incense such as sage or Palo Santo, while walking clockwise around the perimeter of the space. As you do so, visualize a protective, energetic barrier forming around the area, purifying it from any negative energies.

b. Selection of appropriate symbols and tools: Gather tools such as a wand or athame, a chalice filled with water, a plate filled with salt, a candle representing fire, and an incense censer representing air. Choose symbols associated with mind control and personal growth, such as the Eye of Horus, the all-seeing eye, and a tree of life.

c. Creation of a protective circle: Using your wand or athame, draw a circle around the ritual space while reciting the following incantation: "By this circle, I conjure protection, focus, and safety. Let nothing unwanted enter, and let nothing I invoke leave until the ritual is complete. So mote it be."

2. Choosing the Thoughtform or Egregore:

Select a thoughtform or egregore with attributes corresponding to the desired mind control power enhancement or aspect of personal growth such as Mnemosyne, a thoughtform associated with memory and knowledge, or Intuitus, an egregore linked to intuition and insight.

3. Sigil Creation:

Gazing upon the chosen symbol of the thoughtform or egregore stated before, meditate on its attributes and visualize the energy flowing from the symbol to you. Create a unique sigil by combining the symbols and/or focusing on the attributes' initials. Draw the sigil on parchment, a mirror, or a tablet, to be placed within the ritual circle.

4. Chants and Invocations:

**Begin the ritual by welcoming the chosen thoughtform or egregore with an invocation such as**: "Mnemosyne the all-knowing, your insight I seek. Intuitus, whose sight pierces beyond the veil, grant me clarity. By the elements and my will, may you join me in this sacred space and lend me your wisdom and power."

5. Step-by-Step Ritual Process:

a. Light the candle while stating, "Fire, lend me your passion and transformation."
b. Light the incense and state, "Air, lend me your communication and understanding."
c. Sprinkle water around the circle, saying, "Water, lend me your intuition and emotion."
d. Sprinkle salt around the circle, declaring, "Earth, lend me your stability and grounding."

With these actions, each element is welcomed and called upon. Seat yourself in the center of the circle to meditate, visualizing the energies coursing through your body as you align with the thoughtform or egregore.

6. Interaction and Negotiation:

Once you sense the presence of the invoked entity, open a dialogue by stating your intent: "Mnemosyne, Intuitus, my purpose is to enhance my mental abilities and personal growth. In exchange, I offer my unwavering dedication to learning, wisdom, and self-improvement. Grant me your favor and guidance in this sacred pursuit."

7. Sealing the Acquired Powers:

**Hold the sigil in your hands and empower it with your intentions as you recite**: "With this sigil, I seal my bond with Mnemosyne and Intuitus. May your wisdom and insight become part of me, magnifying my mind control abilities and personal growth. Blessed be."

Wear or carry the sigil with you, allowing its energy and the bond you have forged to become embedded within your life.

8. Closing the Ritual:

Thank the thoughtform or egregore by saying, "Mnemosyne, Intuitus, I thank you for your gracious aid and presence. Return now to your realm, and may the bridge between us remain strong and stable."

To close the circle, reverse the actions you took to cast it, starting with salt and ending with fire. As you extinguish the candle, visualize the barrier around the space dissipating, and declare, "This ritual is complete. The circle is open, but unbroken. So mote it be."
