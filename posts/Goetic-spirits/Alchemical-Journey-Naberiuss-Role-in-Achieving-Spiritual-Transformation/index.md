To begin understanding the intricate relationship between Spirit Naberius of the Goetia and the alchemical pursuit for the Philosopher's Stone, it is essential to briefly introduce the key players and their respective attributes. The Goetia is a collection of 72 spirits, collectively known as Goetic spirits, outlined in the lesser key of Solomon. These spirits are often invoked for various purposes, from acquiring knowledge to manipulating reality. Naberius, in particular, is the 24th spirit in this collection and is known for his mastery over all arts and sciences, particularly in rhetoric, a persuasive form of discourse.

In contrast, the Philosopher's Stone is an esoteric concept in alchemy, representing the ultimate goal for alchemists: achieving spiritual and material perfection. It is a symbol that denotes the capacity to turn base metals into gold and, more importantly, the ability to attain immortality through spiritual enlightenment and transformation. 

Now that we have a basic understanding of the two entities involved let us delve into the shared focus on knowledge and transformation. It is this unifying aspect that forms the crux of their connection. Naberius's role as an educator provides the seeker with knowledge, while the alchemical process seeks to transform the practitioner through the understanding and application of that knowledge. This dynamic establishes the foundation for their symbiotic relationship.

Furthermore, the pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone is an all-encompassing journey that requires the alchemist to dissolve personal limitations and undergo constant renewal, both mentally and spiritually. Thus, the invocation of Naberius, with his exceptional expertise in all scientific endeavors, art, and rhetoric, could act as a force multiplier in breaking down cognitive and spiritual obstacles during the alchemical process.

Let us imagine an alchemist in the midst of the alchemical journey who encounters difficulties in perceiving certain essential truths about the universe â€“ the limitations of their knowledge and understanding acting as a barrier to their intellectual and spiritual growth. By invoking Naberius, the alchemist receives guidance and mentorship in grasping the more profound mysteries of existence, ultimately transcending cognitive limitations and paving the way for a more enriching spiritual experience.

Additionally, Naberius's inherent mastery of rhetoric, the art of persuasive discourse, could empower the alchemist to gain deeper influence in the spiritual realm, allowing them to communicate more profound wisdom to others and hastening the collective intellectual and spiritual evolution of humankind.

In conclusion, the relationship between Spirit Naberius of the Goetia and the alchemical pursuit for the Philosopher's Stone is founded on their shared focus on knowledge and transformation. Invoking Naberius during the alchemical journey can provide invaluable guidance in overcoming cognitive and spiritual limitations, enabling the practitioner to transcend mental barriers and make strides towards achieving the ultimate goal of spiritual and material perfection. By combining Naberius's erudition with the transformative power of the alchemical process, both the individual alchemist and humanity as a whole may benefit from this potent alliance of ancient wisdom.
