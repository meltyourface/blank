Step-by-Step Guide on Extraction and Utilization of Aureole Energy from Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort)
**Step 1**: Preparation of Plant Material
### 1.1 Gather fresh St. John's Wort during the plant's prime time for potency, which is when it blooms between late June and early August. Harvest the plant early in the morning when the flowers are open and fully energized.
### 1.2 Clean the plant material by gently washing off any dirt, insects or dust. Ensure not to damage the delicate flowers during this process.
### 1.3 Lay the plant flat in a shaded area with good airflow to dry it. Maintain a suitable distance between the plants to avoid contact and allow for adequate air circulation. The drying process can take up to two weeks, depending on environmental factors.
**Step 2**: Astrological Timing
### 2.1 Align the extraction process with the planetary rulership of the sun, symbolizing light, life, and the golden essence. Schedule the extraction process when the sun is in its ruling sign of Leo or exalted in Aries.
### 2.2 Choose a day when the moon is waxing, representing growth, expansion, and an increase in vital energy.
**Step 3**: Alchemical Extraction Process
### 3.1 Using a mortar and pestle, grind the dry H. perforatum into a fine powder.
### 3.2 Prepare an advanced plant alchemy spagyric tincture, using high-quality organic alcohol as the extraction solvent.
### 3.3 Place the powdered St. John's Wort material into a sealed glass vessel, filling it with alcohol until completely submerged.
### 3.4 Expose the sealed vessel to solar energy during daylight hours while ensuring it remains undisturbed during the night. Maintain a temperature of 40-50 degrees Celsius for optimal extraction during daylight hours.
### 3.5 Follow the circulatory extraction process for 40-50 days, ensuring the material remains submerged in alcohol and is shaken gently each day when exposed to sunlight to ensure maximum extraction of the herb's vital elements.
### 3.6 After the extraction is complete, filter and separate the tincture. Carefully evaporate the alcohol, left with the salts and minerals of the plant, and then combine the purified salts with the tincture, creating the final aureole essence of St. John's Wort.
**Step 4**: Applications of Aureole Energy
### 4.1 Spiritual: Utilize the essence to invoke solar energies, amplify personal power, and encourage self-realization.
### 4.2 Physical: Apply the essence to aid in the remediation of skin conditions, combat fatigue, and alleviate pain due to its anti-inflammatory properties.
### 4.3 Mental: Use the essence to enhance mental clarity, balance neurotransmitters, and mitigate symptoms of anxiety and depression.
**Step 5**: Precautions, Safety Measures, and Ethical Considerations

### 5.2 Seek professional guidance if pregnant, breastfeeding, or experiencing severe mental health concerns before using the essence.
### 5.3 Respect the environment when gathering H. perforatumâ€”ethically source and harvest the plant.
