Answer:

To effectively answer this challenge, it is fundamental to understand the historical background and context of the Civil War period in England, identify influential key figures, and elucidate the link between these figures and occultism or esoteric beliefs. This response will follow these essential steps:

1. **Brief Historical Background**
2. **Key Figures and their Occult Influence **
3. **Sociopolitical Impact of Occultism and Esotericism**
4. **War Strategies and Outcome**
5. **Key Themes and Conclusions **

1. Brief Historical Background:
The Civil War period in England (also known as the English Revolution) primarily took place between 1642 and 1651. The war was essentially a struggle between the Stuart monarchy (King Charles I) and the English Parliament, fueled by conflicting religious, political, and social beliefs. While the monarchy held the view of divine right and absolutism, the parliamentarians supported the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Eventually, this conflict led to the trial, conviction, and execution of King Charles I, followed by the establishment of the Commonwealth of England under the rule of Oliver Cromwell and the eventual restoration of the Stuart monarchy.

2. Key Figures and their Occult Influence:
During this turbulent period, several key figures exhibited esoteric and occult beliefs that significantly impacted their decisions and ideals. These figures include:

A. John Dee:
John Dee, an influential mathematician, occultist, and astrologer, served as an advisor to Queen Elizabeth I. As a prominent scholar of the Hermetic arts, Dee's influence extended beyond the scientific realm to esoteric concepts such as alchemy, theurgy, and angelic communication. Although Dee passed away before the Civil War, his works and teachings inspired future generations, impacting the war's intellectual climate.

B. Jacob Boehme:
Jacob Boehme, a German mystic, and spiritualist influenced the beliefs of several key figures, including William Law (an influential writer and theologian), John Pordage (leader of the Philadelphian Society), and Jane Lead (a renowned female mystic and leader of the Philadelphian Society). Through his writings and teachings, Boehme spread the ideas of Gnostic Christianity; a blend of Christian theology with occult and mystical elements that contributed to the religious and ideological conflicts during the war.

3. Sociopolitical Impact of Occultism and Esotericism:
The mingling of occult and esoteric ideas with religious and political ideologies significantly impacted the sociopolitical landscape during the Civil War period. It fueled political dissent between royalists and parliamentarians, aligning with the religious divide between Anglicans and Puritans, Catholics and Protestants, and other minority factions such as the Quakers, Ranters, and Diggers. In this environment, mysticism and esotericism provided solace and purpose to individuals seeking spiritual experiences beyond orthodox religious practices.

4. War Strategies and Outcome:
The influence of occultism and esoteric beliefs on key figures translated into war strategies that shaped the tactics and outcome of the Civil War. Visionaries and prophets played a significant role in the decision-making process of the military leaders, guiding their strategic choices based on astrological events and mystical revelations. For example, both the royalists and the parliamentarians utilized astrology to determine the best time to engage in battle, believing that the alignment of celestial bodies could reveal victory.

Additionally, esoteric ideas about the divine right of King Charles I and the power of the monarchy influenced several strategic decisions during the war. The belief in the legitimacy of the king's rule, fueled by occult elements, led to a heightened level of loyalty among the royalists, determined to protect divine providence at all costs.

Ultimately, the English Civil War concluded with the victory of the parliamentarians under Oliver Cromwell, executing King Charles I and leading to a brief period of republicanism. The widespread influence of occultism and esotericism abated in the following years as religious tolerance and secularism took precedence.

5. Key Themes and Conclusions:
The influence of occultism and esoteric beliefs on key figures during the Civil War period in England played a significant role in shaping strategic decisions, contributing to the sociopolitical context, and impacting the outcome of the war. This influence altered the internal dynamics of religious sects, inspired loyalty and rebellion, and underscored the importance of spiritual purpose in conflict resolution. It is essential to recognize that esoteric beliefs and practices may have been fundamental in the decision-making processes of political and military leaders throughout history, particularly during times of great upheaval and societal transformation.
