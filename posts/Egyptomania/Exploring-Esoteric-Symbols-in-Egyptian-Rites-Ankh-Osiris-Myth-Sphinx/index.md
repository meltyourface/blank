To provide a comprehensive response to this knowledge challenge, we will first need to delve into the esoteric interpretations of the Ankh symbol, the significance of the Osiris myth, and the symbolism of the Sphinx. Through understanding the deeper meanings behind these elements, we can begin to piece together a theory on how they interrelate within the context of Egyptian magico-religious rites. Finally, we will explore any potential aspect of Egyptomania that becomes illuminated through our examination. 

1. Esoteric Meaning of the Ankh:

The Ankh is an ancient Egyptian symbol commonly known as the "key of life" or the "cross of life." Its appearance consists of a loop above a T-shape. The Ankh represents the concept of eternal life, regeneration, and the union of opposites. Here, the loop represents the divine, eternal aspect of existence, while the T-shape signifies the earthly or physical, indicative of the duality present in life. 

In the esoteric realms, the Ankh symbolizes spiritual awakening, divine consciousness, and the fusion of the mortal and immortal aspects of the self. Initiates would use the Ankh as an emblem of their pursuit of understanding the mysteries of existence, life, death, and the divine potential of the human spirit. It acts as a key to unlocking the inner potential and comprehending the interconnectedness of life, death, and rebirth.

2. Significance of the Osiris Myth:

Osiris, an Egyptian god of the afterlife, is a central figure within the ancient Egyptian mythology. Osiris was murdered and dismembered by his brother Set, who desired to seize power. Isis, Osiris' wife, gathered his pieces, restored him to life, and conceived their son Horus in the process. Horus eventually defeated Set and restored order, allowing Osiris to become the ruler of the underworld. 

The myth of Osiris symbolizes the triumph of life over death, the cyclical nature of existence, and the importance of maintaining cosmic balance between chaos and order. It is considered an embodiment of the mysteries of rebirth: Osiris is resurrected to the afterlife, symbolizing the potential for spiritual transformation, renewal, and redemption.

3. Symbolism of the Sphinx:

The Sphinx is a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human, adorned with the headdress of a pharaoh. The most famous Sphinx is the one situated on the Giza Plateau in Egypt. Although the symbolism of the Sphinx is multifaceted, it is primarily seen as a protective and guarding force, representing the junction between the spiritual and physical worlds.

In esoteric doctrines, the Sphinx symbolizes the concept of overcoming challenges and unlocking spiritual potential. The Sphinx has come to embody the riddles of existence, encouraging the initiate to introspect, seek wisdom, and unveil deeper mysteries about the Universe and their own spiritual path.

4. Interrelation of Ankh, Osiris Myth, and Sphinx in Egyptian Magico-Religious Rites:

There are intrinsic connections between the Ankh, the myth of Osiris, and the Sphinx in the practice of Egyptian magico-religious rites. As the Ankh serves as a symbolic key to inner potential and eternal life, its deeper esoteric teachings were intertwined with the Osiris myth, which emphasizes the regeneration and eternal nature of the soul. Furthermore, the Sphinx represents a gatekeeper, guarding the ancient wisdom of life's mysteries.

In the context of magico-religious rites, Egyptian initiates would reenact the myth of Osiris, employ the symbolism of the Ankh, and decipher the deeper message of the Sphinx to gain hidden knowledge. This process was believed to guide them in unlocking the secrets of life and death, leading to spiritual transformations, rebirth, and the attainment of higher consciousness.

5. Elucidation of an Aspect of Egyptomania:

Egyptomania refers to the fascination with ancient Egyptian culture, history, and mythology that has persisted from antiquity to the modern era. Through our exploration of the interrelated esoteric elements and practices, it becomes clear that the allure of Egyptomania lies in its emphasis on spiritual transformation, cosmic balance, and the pursuit of hidden wisdom. The profound nature of Egyptian symbolism and mythology continues to captivate and inspire those who seek a deeper understanding of their own spiritual path, eternal life, and the divine mysteries of existence.

In summary, the esoteric meanings of the Ankh, the significance of the Osiris myth, and the symbolism of the Sphinx are intricately connected within the practice of Egyptian magico-religious rites. Together, they reveal hidden knowledge about the nature of eternal life, spiritual transformation and growth, and cosmic balance. It is the depth and mystery of these interconnected elements that illuminate a key aspect of Egyptomania, capturing the fascination of followers throughout history and inspiring a continued pursuit of spiritual wisdom and understanding.
