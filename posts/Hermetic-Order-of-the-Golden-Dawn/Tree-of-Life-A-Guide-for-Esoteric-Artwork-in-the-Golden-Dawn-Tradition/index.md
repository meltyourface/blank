4. Assign the Paths: Connect the Sephiroth with the twenty-two paths, inserting imagery influenced by Tarot symbolism to represent the energy carried by each path. 
5. Weave in Golden Dawn correspondences: Add symbols, sigils, or images representative of the Golden Dawn's intimate connection with the Tree of Life, such as the Rose Cross or other Order-related emblems.
