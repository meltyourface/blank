Introduction to Elements, Astrological Signs, and Tarot Major Arcana:
Before we embark on this exciting journey of uncovering the underlying connections between the elements, astrological signs, and Tarot Major Arcana, it is essential to first establish a solid foundation to work upon. Therefore, let's explore the basic foundations of each topic.

1. Elements: In the esoteric and occult context, there are four fundamental elements that represent various aspects of life. These are Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Each element signifies a particular energy type, and they are linked to various concepts, such as temperament, physical matter, and metaphysical phenomena.

2. Astrological Signs: Within astrology, there are twelve signs representing different constellations, which are said to have a significant impact on human life. Each sign corresponds with a particular element, modality (Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable), and symbolizes a unique archetype and set of personality traits.

3. Tarot Major Arcana: The Tarot Major Arcana comprises of 22 trump cards that symbolize complex, overarching aspects of the human experience. Each card contains rich, allegorical depictions that stir deep universal insights and awaken subconscious wisdom.

Analyzing Underlying Connections:

Now that we have an overview of our key concepts, let's explore their interconnected relationships.

- Elements and Astrological Signs: The connection between these two concepts is relatively simple, as each of the twelve astrological signs directly corresponds to one of the four elements. These associations with the elements bring a deeper understanding of the sign archetypes and their associated characteristics:

  1. Fire Signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Passion, energy, and dynamism.
  2. Earth Signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Stability, practicality, and grounding.
  3. Air Signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Intellect, communication, and adaptability.
  4. Water Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Emotion, intuition, and depth.

- Elements and Tarot Major Arcana: In this context, elements can be linked to the Tarot through the suits of the Minor Arcana. However, it is essential to recognize that the Major Arcana cards also carry elemental attributes, which tie them to certain themes and energies:

  1. Fire: The cards associated with Fire (such as The Emperor and The Tower) often represent action, power, and transformation.
  2. Earth: Earth's association with cards like The Empress and The World symbolizes abundance, fertility, and prosperity.
  3. Air: Cards like The Fool and The Lovers are connected to Air, signifying communication, intellect, and decision-making.
  4. Water: The Moon and The High Priestess are associated with Water, embodying intuition, emotion, and reflection.

- Astrological Signs and Tarot Major Arcana: The correspondence between astrological signs and Tarot trumps can be established through their underlying archetypes, energies, and meanings. Although the associations can be diverse and intricate, there are already some common pairings, such as the following:

  1. Aries and The Emperor: Leadership, power, and drive.
  2. Taurus and The Hierophant: Tradition, grounding, and sensuality.
  3. Gemini and The Lovers: Choice, duality, and communication.

Synthesizing a Novel Correspondence:

To achieve a coherent and symbiotic resonance, we must identify and synthesize a novel correspondence that honors the unique energies of the elements, astrological signs, and Tarot trumps. To maintain thematic coherence, let's propose a method of linking these concepts through the understanding and integration of the three aspects of the human experience - the physical, intellectual, and spiritual - as follows:

- Physical Sphere: Link the Earth element, Taurus astrological sign, and The Emperor Tarot card, representing the importance of grounding, stability, and leadership.

- Intellectual Sphere: Connect the Air element, Gemini astrological sign, and The Lovers Tarot card, symbolizing the power of intellect, communication, and the ability to balance duality and choice.

- Spiritual Sphere: Associate Water element, Pisces astrological sign, and The High Priestess Tarot card, embodying intuition, spiritual connection, and mystery.

By unifying the aforementioned correspondences, we can offer initiates and students of the esoteric, occult, and correspondence studies a novel and profound perspective on these aspects within one comprehensive and interconnected system.

Key Themes and Conclusions:

In summary, we have explored and analyzed the underlying connections between the elements, astrological signs, and Tarot Major Arcana. We have:

1. Established basic understandings of each concept.
2. Explored the nuanced relationships between them.
3. Synthesized a new correspondence that weaves them together into a cohesive, symbiotic relationship, focusing on the three spheres - physical, intellectual, and spiritual.

With this novel correspondence, we aim to deepen the understanding and application of these esoteric concepts, facilitating the growth of initiates and seekers on their spiritual journey.
