In the vast and endless cosmic theater,
A glimmer of ancient truths does now appear,
In shadows and whispers Hecate we summon here,
Her vigilant gaze finds hearts that will hear.

Guardian she be, at crossroads where fates entwine,
Mistress of darkness, yet bearer of light divine,
Giver of keys to unlock secrets hidden well,
Queen of witches, in wisdom and power they dwell.

Upon the hallowed earth, she stands in thrice-fold grace,
Luna's phases she completes—virgin, mother, and crone's face.
We sing in praise of the awe-inspiring Triple Moon,
In harmony, her choir utters notes that make men swoon.

Her gaze as ancient as time's mocking dance,
Hecate's torch, ennoble mystery's earthly stance.
The searchers of truth who dare seek her embrace,
Are guided and guarded past pitfalls misplaced.

Keys clasped within her hands of the old,
Unlocking portals and worlds untold,
Vast knowledge her wisdom grants to those who fathom,
Eyes opened wide to realms beyond forgotten.

Serpents entwining, midst her star-kissed mane,
A symbol of transformation, eternal to the mundane,
Through death's embrace, rebirth we shall attain,
With her in our spirit, we'll never wane.

In the cosmic tapestry, her thread weaves eons,
Connecting past, present, and future—never gone.
And to our modern rituals, in reverence and awe,
Hecate remains a bastion of secret knowledge, we draw.

So sing we now of Hecate, ancient goddess of might,
With whispered prayers and chants, we call upon night,
To bring forth her wisdom, her mysteries, her art,
May we unravel her essence, delve deeper into her heart.
