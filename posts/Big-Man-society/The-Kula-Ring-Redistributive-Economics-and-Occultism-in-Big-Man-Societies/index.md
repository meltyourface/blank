To understand and fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first provide insight into the underlying concepts and related topics. This examination will involve the Big Man society, the Kula Ring and its redistributive economic practices, and the aspects of occultism contributing to its development over time. The step-by-step reasoning process will also be explained.

1. **Context**: Big Man society
Big Man society refers to a type of social structure often found in tribal communities, specifically in Melanesia and the Pacific Islands. In this setting, a charismatic and influential figure known as the "Big Man" leads and mediates disputes. His power relies on his aptitudes and capacity to obtain resources, redistribute wealth, and establish social and political connections rather than using formal authority.

2. Kula Ring and its economic significance
The Kula Ring is a ceremonial exchange system practiced in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea, wherein communities engage in reciprocal gift-giving involving valuable marine shells (red spondylus shells called "soulava" and white Conus shells called "mwali"). The purpose of this exchange system, which is based on trust and mutual support, is to establish an intricate web of relationships and alliances among various tribes and individuals.

The Kula Ring functions as a cohesive force among these communities by reinforcing the mutual obligations and dependencies that keep the societal structure united. Importantly, these exchanges occur through non-market mechanisms, which contrast with capitalistic, market-based economies.

3. Redistribution in the Kula Ring
The redistributive economic practices in the context of the Big Man society and the Kula Ring can be understood at both micro and macro levels. At the micro level, the Big Man is responsible for the redistribution of wealth through the circulation of these valuable gifts among his followers, allies, and neighboring chiefs. This redistribution of wealth aids in maintaining his status and influence in the community.

On a macro level, the Kula Ring operates as a large-scale redistribution system, where participants continuously circulate these prestigious gifts in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction across the islands. This system serves to maintain social relationships among different communities and ensure that resources remain within the larger societal network, reinforcing their interdependence.

4. Occultism and the Kula Ring â€“ Magickal and Mundane aspects
To comprehend how occultism has contributed to the development of the Kula Ring and its redistributive economic practices, we will examine both the Magickal and Mundane aspects of the esoteric tradition.

Magickal aspects involve the use of supernatural powers or energies, secret knowledge, and rituals aimed at transforming material or spiritual realities. In the Kula Ring, the Magickal aspects of the occult are evident in the belief systems and rituals associated with the exchange process. The ceremonial shell objects possess spiritual and supernatural significance, and their circulation is accompanied by various rites and taboos reflecting the society's cosmological beliefs.

On the other hand, the Mundane aspects of occultism are those which emphasize the study and practical application of esoteric or hidden knowledge without necessarily invoking supernatural powers. Within the Big Man society and the Kula Ring, the Mundane aspects of occultism can be seen in the strategic manipulations undertaken by participants to increase their prestige and standing within the community. Mastery of the Kula system requires intricate knowledge of its rules, the history of exchanged items, and an ability to forge alliances and influence others.

In summary, the Kula Ring represents an integral aspect of the Big Man society, embodying redistributive economic practices that maintain social relationships and interdependence among communities. Participants circulate prestigious items within this system, establishing alliances and reinforcing their mutual obligations. Occultism, in its Magickal and Mundane forms, has contributed to the development and maintenance of the Kula Ring by imbuing it with supernatural significance and guiding the strategic application of hidden knowledge to maintain individuals' status and influence.
