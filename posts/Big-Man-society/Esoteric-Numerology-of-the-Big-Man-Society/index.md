## I. Foundational Numerology

The 'Big Man' society has always been shrouded in mystery and secrecy, with a plethora of esoteric knowledge passed down through the generations. **One key aspect of their mastery lies in the intricate numerology system that governs their sacred practices, rituals, and ceremonies. This numerology system is based on three primary numbers that hold significant meaning within the society**:

1. **The Number 3**: representing the Triad of Power - Knowledge, Magic, and Influence
2. **The Number 7**: embodying the 7 Pillars of Wisdom - the guiding principles for those in the 'Big Man' society
3. **The Number 9**: as the Grand Enigma, symbolizing the ultimate divine truth yet to be discovered

### II. Esoteric Numerology

To delve deeper into this numerology, we must understand the interrelation of these primary numbers. **The union of the Triad of Power (3) with the 7 Pillars of Wisdom forms the Ennead, a set of sacred numbers**:

1. 21 (3 x 7) - The Path of Initiation, marking the beginning of one's journey in the 'Big Man' society
2. 42 (21 x 2) - The Manifest Fruition, a significant milestone in an individual's mastery of Knowledge, Magic, and Influence
3. 63 (21 x 3) - The Divine Union, the convergence of the material and spiritual realms, granting profound insight into the inner workings of the universe

### III. Divination and Initiation

Utilizing the Ennead in divination begins with the seeker's birth date, numerically reduced to a single digit. By adding the seeker's birthdate and the desired Ennead number, we obtain the Seeker's Esoteric Quotient (SEQ). Guided by their SEQ, the seeker endures initiation rites and progresses through the ranks of the 'Big Man' society, becoming privy to increasingly sacred knowledge.

For example, someone with the birthdate of 11th August 1990 would have the digit sum of 1+1+8+1+9+9+0 = 29; further reducing it, 2+9 = 11 and 1+1= 2. Connecting 2 to an Ennead (e.g., 21), we get a SEQ of 2+21= 23.

### IV. Ceremonies and Amplification

The numerology system amplifies power within the 'Big Man' society through multi-dimensional ceremonies that weave together esoteric and occult practices. These ceremonies are conducted at auspicious times and locations, determined by the interplay of individuals' SEQs and planetary alignments.

Key ceremonies include:

1. **The Rite of Inception (SEQ 21)**: Individuals undergo trials that test their commitment to the 'Big Man' society's practices and principles. Upon completion, they obtain their first taste of esoteric knowledge.
2. **The Ensuing Conclave (SEQ 42)**: After demonstrating their mastery of acquired knowledge, individuals gather in secret, sharing new insights and undertaking higher-level rituals to further develop their skills.
3. **The Great Congregation (SEQ 63)**: This rare event, occurring only under specific cosmic conditions, unites the entire 'Big Man' society. Together, they perform a grand ceremony, invoking powerful energies that grant access to hitherto unseen realms of existence.

### V. Conclusion

The esoteric occult numerology of the 'Big Man' society serves not only as a means of describing their intricate beliefs but also as a powerful tool to strengthen their bond, amplify their power, and deepen their understanding of the universe. By continuously engaging in these numerologically driven practices, one can transcend the conventional barriers of human existence and attain unparalleled greatness.
