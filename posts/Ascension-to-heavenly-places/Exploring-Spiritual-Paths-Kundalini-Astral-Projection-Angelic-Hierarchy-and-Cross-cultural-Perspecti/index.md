Kundalini Awakening:
The concept of kundalini awakening originates from ancient Indian yogic traditions and has roots in Hinduism and Tantra. Kundalini refers to a form of divine, feminine energy believed to reside at the base of the spine, coiled like a serpent. Kundalini awakening is the process by which this energy is awakened and allowed to rise along the spine through the seven chakras, ultimately reaching the crown chakra, leading to spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine. This awakening could manifest in various physical, emotional, and spiritual sensations, and it is often facilitated through practices such as meditation, yoga, and pranayama.

Astral Projection:
Astral projection is an esoteric and occult practice that involves the intentional separation of one's astral body, also known as the subtle body or light body, from the physical body. This concept has roots in various cultural and spiritual traditions, including ancient Egypt, Hermeticism, and Theosophy. The astral body can travel freely in the astral plane, a non-physical realm thought to contain different levels of existence, realms, and dimensions of consciousness. Proponents of astral projection argue that this practice can lead to spiritual growth, heightened awareness, and increased psychic abilities.

Angelic Hierarchy:
The angelic hierarchy represents a structured organization of angels, divine messengers, and spiritual beings that exist in various religious and spiritual systems, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. This hierarchy is often associated with the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a Christian mystic who detailed a complex structure of angels that exist in nine levels or choirs. The nine choirs, in descending order, are the Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. Each choir is believed to have specific roles, responsibilities, and attributes that contribute to the divine order and spiritual governance of the cosmos.

Nuanced Differences Between Concepts and Their Roles in Ascension:
While Kundalini Awakening, Astral Projection, and Angelic Hierarchy might seem closely related at first glance, they serve different roles in the journey towards Ascension. Kundalini awakening focuses on the internal and individual process of awakening and channeling the latent spiritual energy within oneself. Astral projection involves the exploration of external astral planes and dimensions, expanding the understanding of reality and consciousness. The angelic hierarchy exists as the spiritual entities that guide, protect, and support the spiritual ascent and enlightenment of humans.

Cross-cultural Perspectives and Adaptations:
The concepts in the domain of Ascension to heavenly places transcend cultures and religious systems. Practices akin to kundalini awakening can be found in Tibetan Buddhism (known as Tummo), Chinese Taoist practices (referred to as Chi), and various indigenous spiritual traditions worldwide. Similarly, astral projection-like experiences are reported in cultures ranging from ancient shamanic traditions to modern Western esotericism. The idea of supernatural beings operating within a hierarchical structure is a recurring theme in many religious belief systems, such as the Devas in Hinduism and the Avestan concept of Yazatas in Zoroastrianism.

In conclusion, a deep exploration of these terminologies leads to a more profound understanding of spiritual paths that revolve around personal growth, self-discovery, and transcending the realms of physical existence. This intricate analysis also helps us appreciate the various cultural perspectives and adaptations of these concepts, ultimately enriching our understanding of the human pursuit of Ascension.
