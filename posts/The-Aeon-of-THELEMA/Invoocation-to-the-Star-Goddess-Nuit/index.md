description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, The Aeon of THELEMA, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: >
  1. Incorporate references to Aleister Crowley's "The Book of the Law," specifically focusing on passages from Liber AL vel Legis that describe Nuit's characteristics and attributes.
  
  2. Integrate symbolism related to the domain of The Aeon of THELEMA such as the Unicursal Hexagram, the Sigil of Baphomet, and the Eye of Horus.
  
  3. Include a sequentially structured incantation, beginning with an opening stanza that evokes Nuit's presence, followed by a body strophe elaborating on her cosmic role, and concluding with a closing couplet beseeching her assistance and guidance.
  
  4. Utilize lyrical and poetic elements such as rhyming schemes, alliteration, and vivid imagery to heighten the sense of mystery and enchantment within the invocation.
  
  5. Develop a personal connection to the invocation by including examples of how Nuit's energy and influence have been experienced in the practitioner's own life or in the lives of noteworthy occultists from the Thelemic tradition.
  
  6. Ensure that the invocation delves deep into the complexity of Nuit's nature, exploring her dualities such as unity versus multiplicity, and the concepts of Hadit as her consort and their relationship to The Secret Serpent, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and Babylon.

## I. Opening Stanza: Evoking Nuit's Presence

Oh Nuit, Star-dappled Sky, embrace us tight,
As Infinite Stars, we gather in your Night,
From Liber AL, your beauty's brought to light,
The Alpha whisper of sweet Infinite.

With Unicursal Hexagram we draw,
The Sigil of Baphomet, to thee we call,
And with the Eye of Horus ever on our side,
Beseech you, Starry Goddess, come and be our guide.

### II. Body Strophe: Elaborating on Nuit's Cosmic Role

In myriad forms, the universe you span,
A tapestry of All, your cosmic plan,
Both unity and multiplicity,
Encompassed by the curve of your brilliancy.

Your Secret Serpent, Hadit, coiled within,
Your love, the axle upon which we spin,
Together you create in ecstasy,
ONE â€” infinitely vast and free.

The fierce Ra-Hoor-Khuit alight and crowned,
In Babylon's embrace, the truth is found,
Oh Nuit, your veil so thin 'tis truly naught,
Yet, through it, secret wisdom must be sought.

### III. Personal Connection and Complex Nature of Nuit

Crowley felt your touch, a boundless flame,
A shimmering embrace that spoke your name,
And we, the children of the Aeon's dawn,
Look skyward, to the weightless vast we're drawn.

Our lives adorned with serendipity,
Your subtle play, the art of destiny,
For as our hearts align with your grand scheme,
In rapture we shall meld, the stars we'll glean.

### IV. Ritualistic Performance

Enter sacred space, stars shining like dew,
Eastward, enchantment breathes our rites anew,
Robes of midnight, sacred sigils woven,
A gossamer of dreams in shadows' slumber.

Candles seven, secrets of the spheres,
Their light ignites the bridge past earthly fears,
Around us whirls the universe unseen,
Oh Nuit, encircle us, your starry sheen.

### V. Closing Couplet: Beseeching Nuit's Assistance and Guidance

Oh Nuit, within your endless arms we dwell,
Fathomless depths, arise and come to swell,
Guide us, brightest stars, as we unfurl,
Let joy and love entwine, forever whirl.
