To analyze and dissect the biblical story of Moses parting the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-31) in terms of elements, symbolism, and potential underlying magical principles within Christian magic, let's begin by exploring the narrative itself. After that, we'll break down the elements, symbolism, and magical principles at work, and then weâ€™ll examine how these aspects may still be relevant in contemporary practices and methodologies of spiritual advancement for initiates.

The story takes place when Moses, under God's command, leads the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt towards the Promised Land. The Egyptian Pharaoh, regretting the loss of his workforce, pursues them with his army. When the Israelites reach the Red Sea, they find themselves trapped between the sea and the approaching Egyptian army. At this point, Moses parts the waters of the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to cross safely to the other side. When the Egyptians follow, the waters close upon them, drowning the entire army and securing the Israelites' freedom.

1. **Elements**: The main elements present in this story are water, air, and fire. Water represents the Red Sea, which is both an obstacle and a source of liberation for the Israelites. Air is the element used by Moses when he stretches out his hand over the sea to part it, as the "strong east wind" (Exodus 14:21) plays a key role in this event. Fire is present through the pillar of fire and cloud, a divine manifestation that protects and guides the Israelites throughout their journey.

2. **Symbolism**: The parting of the Red Sea holds rich symbolism for spiritual and personal growth in Christian magic. The sea represents an obstacle or barrier that one must overcome in their spiritual journey. The act of parting the waters symbolizes the power of faith and divine intervention, which can help one transcend seemingly insurmountable challenges in life. Moreover, the destruction of Pharaoh's army can be seen as the dismantling of ego, and freeing oneself from the yoke of one's past harmful habits and beliefs.

3. **Magical Principles**: This biblical account contains several magical principles within Christian magic. First of all, it showcases the power of divine guidance and communication: Moses is closely following God's commands and using his divinely granted gifts to achieve what seems impossible. Secondly, it emphasizes the role of faith and trust in the divine, as the Israelites need to believe in Moses' ability to save them despite the impossible odds.

Now, let's see how these elements, symbolism, and magical principles may extend into modern-day practices and methodologies of spiritual advancement for initiates:

- In the contemporary context, spiritual seekers may use the example of parting the Red Sea as a metaphor to overcome personal struggles or engage in transformative inner work for personal growth. 
- Practitioners may draw upon the story's elements and symbolism, invoking air and water to symbolize the power and wisdom of the divine, while contemplating the fire element to represent the inner light and guidance that comes from deepening one's faith.
- The magical principles found in the story can also influence modern spiritual practices. Developing a strong connection to the divine through prayer, meditation, and channeling allows believers to access guidance and wisdom, as Moses did. Trusting in a higher power's will and timing can help them face challenges and impossible situations with courage and conviction, ultimately leading to spiritual growth.

In conclusion, the biblical story of Moses parting the Red Sea provides rich insights into the elements, symbolism, and potential underlying magical principles within Christian magic. Water, air, and fire play crucial roles in the narrative, while symbols of faith, freedom, and internal transformation abound. By connecting with these concepts, contemporary spiritual initiates can draw upon this story's wisdom, applying its magical principles, while adapting them to modern practices and methodologies of spiritual advancement.
