## I. Invocation of the Four Archangels

**Begin each day by invoking the four Archangels**: Raphael, the healer and patron of travelers; Michael, the protector and warrior of light; Gabriel, the messenger and revealer of divine mysteries; and Uriel, the illuminator and guide in spiritual understanding. Focus on each Archangel's unique attributes, and ask for their guidance and protection throughout the day.

### II. Parabolic Contemplation

Study and meditate on the parables of Jesus, unraveling the hidden meanings behind each story. Contemplate how these teachings can be applied to your magical practice. Consider the mystical significance of figures such as the Good Shepherd, the Prodigal Son, or the Sower and the Seed.

### III. **Visualization Practice**: The Tree of Life

Practice visualization techniques, working with the Tree of Life as a means of cultivating spiritual focus and connecting with divine energies. Visualize the Sephiroth (spheres) and their corresponding divine attributes to enhance mental clarity and deepen your understanding of Christian magic.

### IV. Eucharistic Adoration and Consecration

Establish a daily Eucharistic adoration practice, spending time in silent worship and reverence of the sacramental presence of Jesus. Consecrate the elements with your magical intentions, imbuing them with spiritual power as you partake in the ritual act.

### V. Scriptural Divination

Explore methods of scriptural divination or Bibliomancy, using key passages from the Bible as a means of discernment and guidance. Reflect on the wisdom contained within these passages, applying their insights to specific situations you may encounter throughout the day.

### VI. Memorization and Recitation of Prayers

Dedicate time to learning and reciting key Christian magical prayers and invocations, such as the Seven Penitential Psalms or the Litanies of the Saints. Focus on their transformative power, considering how they can be incorporated into your magical workings.

### VII. Self-Examination and Repentance

Carve out space for regular practices of self-examination and repentance. Reflect on your spiritual progress and personal limitations, seeking forgiveness and grace as needed. Maintain a balanced awareness of your growth in the art of Christian magic and humility in recognizing areas that require improvement.

### VIII. Sacramentals and Sacred Objects

Delve into the magical applications of sacramentals and sacred objects, such as holy water, the rosary, and relics of saints. Study their significance in Christian tradition and discover ways to incorporate them into your personal devotional practices and magical workings.

### IX. Fasting and Spiritual Discipline

Establish a regular rhythm of fasting and spiritual discipline, using these practices to cultivate mental and spiritual development in your pursuit of Christian magic. Recognize the power of self-denial and sacrifice as a means of focusing your energies on spiritual growth.

### X. Daily Prayerful Reflection

Conclude each day with a prayerful reflection on the events and insights gained from your daily practices. Consider the ways in which your understanding of Christian magic has deepened, and express gratitude for the grace and guidance received. Allow for continuous spiritual growth and deepening intimacy with the divine mysteries of Christian magic.
