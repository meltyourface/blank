To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we need to explore and understand the various aspects of the question, including: Western esotericism and Eastern mysticism, the principles of theurgy and sexual magick within OTO's teachings, Crowley's emphasis on the True Will in Thelema, his reinterpretation of ancient Egyptian spiritual practices and the significance of individual sovereignty in achieving transcendental experiences throughout the initiatory process.

Firstly, let's briefly discuss the nature of Western esotericism and Eastern mysticism and how OTO managed to synchronize the two paradigms. Western esotericism refers to the wide range of spiritual and philosophical practices encompassing various branches like Hermeticism, Alchemy, Gnosticism, Kabbalah, and others. Eastern mysticism refers to the assortment of spiritual and esoteric practices originating from the East, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis) sought to bring together these various traditions and practices under one framework, often finding commonalities and shared symbolism that could bridge the gap between the East and West.

In the context of OTO's teachings, theurgy and sexual magick play key roles in the initiatory process. Theurgy is a practice of ritual magick with the intention of invoking the presence of divine beings, such as gods or angels, in order to achieve spiritual enlightenment and divine guidance. This practice emphasizes the importance of transcending the mundane, ego-bound consciousness and connecting with the divine realm in order to gain a higher perspective on life's challenges and experiences.

Sexual magick, on the other hand, is a practice of utilizing sexual energy and experiences as a means of achieving spiritual growth, transformation, and attaining higher states of consciousness. OTO teachings maintain that by properly directing and controlling sexual energies, one can achieve a multitude of spiritual and practical benefits.

These principles interconnect with Crowley's emphasis on the True Will in Thelema, the religious and spiritual system he founded. The True Will is the essential and authentic desire or purpose of an individual, as determined by their deepest self. The goal of the Thelemic path is to discover and align oneself with one's True Will, which in turn leads to enlightened self-understanding, spiritual growth, and ultimately, greater harmony with the universe.

Crowley's understanding of Thelema was deeply influenced by his reinterpretation of ancient Egyptian spiritual practices. For example, he incorporated aspects of the Egyptian god Horus and his mythological narrative into the teaching of Thelema. The core message of Thelema - "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" - can be seen as an extension of the ancient Egyptian emphasis on self-knowledge and the pursuit of the divine. In connecting these concepts, Crowley sought to create an amalgamation of ancient wisdom and modern spiritual exploration.

Finally, the theme of individual sovereignty is paramount in OTO and Thelema. Throughout the initiatory process, seekers are encouraged to assert their independent will, judgment, and authority in the pursuit of spiritual growth and divine attainment. The principles of theurgy, sexual magick, and True Will work together, empowering the individual to overcome the limitations of mundane existence and establish their own authentic connection with the divine in order to achieve transcendental experiences.

To summarize, OTO's synchronization of Western esotericism and Eastern mysticism, combined with the principles of theurgy, sexual magick, and the True Will in Thelema, offer an elaborate framework for seekers of spiritual growth and self-discovery. By interconnecting these elements with Crowley's reinterpretation of ancient Egyptian spirituality, OTO emphasizes the importance of individual sovereignty in achieving transcendental experiences throughout the initiatory process. As a result, the esoteric path offered by OTO and Thelema presents a unique and profound journey for those seeking to master their own spiritual destiny.
