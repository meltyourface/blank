The art of alchemy traces its roots back to the ancient Egyptian civilization, where it found its beginnings in attempts to create precious metals from common substances. Over the centuries, the practice spread across various cultures, such as the Hellenistic, Arab, Indian, and Chinese.

Parallel to these studies, the occult practices began to develop and intertwined with alchemy, creating a fusion of mystical knowledge, symbolism, and transformation.

3. **Separation**: This process involves isolating valuable components from their impure counterparts.

4. **Conjunction**: Combining purified ingredients to form a new substance that embodies desirable qualities.

The key to mastering the techniques is recognizing the properties of individual ingredients and using them with intention, focus, and profound respect for the mystical energies they possess.
