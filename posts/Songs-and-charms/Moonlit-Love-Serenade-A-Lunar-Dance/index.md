Verse I:
In shadows dance in candle's light,
Amongst the whispers of the night,
A serenade of love's desire,
Weaves upon a lyre of fire.

Melodies from ancient lore,
Summoned from the ocean floor,
With embers painting starlit skies,
A tale of love shall harmonize.

Chorus:
Eclipsed, our hearts in lunar dance,
Moonlit rendezvous, a mystic trance,
Bound by the art of flame and bloom,
Love's alchemy, entwined in fumes.

Verse II:
As tides enthrall the midnight seas,
A potion brewed of rarest leaves,
Essences of roots and air,
A binding charm from love's sweet lair.

Beseech the spirits, heavens gleam,
By sacred runes and eldritch dreams,
Impart the secrets passion hides,
Two souls collide as worlds align.

Chorus:
Eclipsed, our hearts in lunar dance,
Moonlit rendezvous, a mystic trance,
Bound by the art of flame and bloom,
Love's alchemy, entwined in fumes.

Bridge:
Penetrate the veil unknown,
In hallowed circles, love is sewn,
Vulnerability and strength, as one,
Reflected in the ember's sun.

Liberate the passions penned,
Sublime enchantments never end,
For in this sonic spell I cast,
Two hearts resound in bliss steadfast.

Chorus:
Eclipsed, our hearts in lunar dance,
Moonlit rendezvous, a mystic trance,
Bound by the art of flame and bloom,
Love's alchemy, entwined in fumes.

Outro:
And as the stars shall intertwine,
This tapestry of fate and time,
Our love, a testament divine,
A sacred charm, forever mine.
