### V. Ritual for Amplifying Potency

1. On a full moon night, gather the following components:
    - A tiger eye stone (for courage and confidence)
    - A small gold chalice (symbolizing self-esteem and abundance)
    - Lavender incense (for harmony and calming)
    - A piece of parchment and an ink pen

2. Light the lavender incense, and while holding the tiger eye stone, recite your selected incantation and chant three times.

3. Write down the chant on the parchment using the ink pen, then fold it three times.

4. Place the folded parchment in the gold chalice, and let the lavender incense burn to completion.

5. Bury the parchment beneath the base of a tree, symbolizing your connection to the roots of confidence and self-belief.

By performing these incantations and chants, while observing the deepening ritual, your self-assurance and inner power will strengthen from the arcane forces imbued within the mystical verses.
