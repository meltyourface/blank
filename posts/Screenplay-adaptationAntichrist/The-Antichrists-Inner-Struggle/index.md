INT. ABANDONED CHURCH - NIGHT

The Antichrist (JOHN) stands before a shattered stained glass window, moonlight bathing his face in a cold glow. He clenches a worn, ancient book in one hand. The protagonist (SARAH) is bound to a dilapidated pew, fear and determination in her eyes.

JOHN
(Narrating, while holding a lit candle in his free hand)
In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth. You find comfort in those words, don't you, Sarah? It's a tale of cosmic order, of a greater plan. A comforting fiction.

(He flips through the book, stopping at a page with strange symbols)

But I know another story, one hidden from mankind's eyes for millennia. It's my story.

(John looks Sarah directly in the eyes, his voice growing stronger and more confident)

You call me the Antichrist. And I cannot deny it. I am a demon born of sin and fire, destined to wage war upon the delicate fabric that drapes across this world. My very existence is to be the harbinger of the end times, who will lead the armies of hell into battle against the hosts of Heaven. Apocalypse, the end of everything you know, clings to my every step.

(He lets out a sigh)

But why? Why am I cursed to be humanity's greatest nightmare? Is it because I am inherently evil, or is it the grand design of some unfathomable divine scheme?

(John gazes contemplatively at the candle, his features displaying an internal conflict)

You see, Sarah, a part of me yearns to resist my inescapable fate. To redeem myself, to escape the shadows cast upon me from the moment of my conception. To wage war against the darkness that consumes me.
 
(He smirks, chuckling darkly)

But it's all for naught, isn't it? I am trapped within a cosmic game of good versus evil, wearing the skin of the beast, the serpent of Old. The Book of Revelation preordained my defeat, the doom of Lucifer and his infernal legions.

(The candle flame flickers ominously as he continues)

But what if the final battle isn't settled on some future battlefield, amid blood and fire? What if it rages within me, here and now? The end of days, now reduced to echoes in the fading light...

(He gazes at the candle and takes a deep breath, before looking at Sarah with sorrow and menace)

And so, we find ourselves here, in the husk of a holy place. Our souls entwined in this cosmic struggle. You represent the last bastion of hope, while I embody the maelstrom of chaos and doom.

(John leans in closer to Sarah, an intensity burning in his eyes)

I will either be humanity's destruction or its salvation. This choice hangs before me like the Sword of Damocles. A cruel twist of fate that the light within me battles incessantly with the dark.

(Suddenly, he blows out the candle, plunging the room into darkness)

JOHN (O.S)
The final act is nigh, Sarah. Are you ready to bear witness to my transcendence or my descent into damnation? Pray then to your God, as we are upon the precipice of eternity. The wheel of fate turns, and the endâ€¦ begins.

As the echoes of John's last words resonate in the darkness, the tension and sense of foreboding reaches its peak, foreshadowing the impending climactic battle between him and Sarah.

FADE OUT.
