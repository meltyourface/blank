Answering the knowledge challenge on incorporating occult symbolism and esoteric elements in a screenplay based on the Antichrist character requires us to first have a deep understanding of the Antichrist figure and the occult meanings associated with it. We then need to identify the esoteric elements that can be weaved into the screenplay to create a multi-layered narrative that encourages viewers to engage in deep contemplation. 

The Antichrist figure is traditionally associated with being the ultimate embodiment of evil, a counterpart to the Christian Messiah with deeply rooted connections to Satan or other forces of darkness. While the character of the Antichrist has been portrayed in various forms throughout history, the essential attributes include deception, manipulation, charisma and power. We will focus on these attributes when incorporating esoteric elements and occult symbolism to create a complex character and narrative.

Considering the association of the Antichrist figure with evil, deception, and darkness, we should introduce symbolism that both reinforces and subtly subverts this established personality. **To achieve this, we can incorporate the following occult symbols and esoteric concepts**:

1. **Inverted symbols**: Inverting widely recognized spiritual symbols can convey a sense of corruption and profanation. For example, an inverted cross or pentagram within the context of the film signals the Antichrist's corrupted use of sacred symbols for dark purposes. These subtle inversions can be used within architecture, clothing, and artwork in the film to create a sinister backdrop for the character and actions.

2. **Sigils and occult imagery**: Sigils are symbols commonly used in magick and sorcery, which are believed to embody the will and desires of their creator. Including sigils within the visual components of the film, such as on letters, paintings, or tattoos, will create an esoteric tone while implying that the Antichrist has a hidden agenda connected to a higher, hidden knowledge.

3. **Numerology and gematria**: The use of numbers with occult significance, such as 666 (number of the Beast), 72 (number of demons in the Lesser Key of Solomon), and 777 (number often associated with divine perfection), can add layers of meaning for the viewers to decipher. Introducing these numbers within the narrative, such as through significant dates, addresses, or coded messages, will give the audience cues to delve deeper into the film's symbolic framework.

4. **Alchemy and theurgy**: The practice of alchemy and theurgy involves the transmutation of base materials or elements into something greater or divine. By incorporating these concepts into the character's actions, such as through the pursuit of power, transformation, or dominion, we can create a sense of depth and complexity that engages the audience in contemplating the character's ultimate goals.

5. **Esoteric teachings and philosophies**: Referencing specific esoteric teachings or philosophies, such as Gnosticism, Hermeticism, or Thelema, can add depth and nuance to the Antichrist's character and motivations. These references can manifest themselves through dialogue, actions, or visual motifs that reflect the character's alignment with, or perversion of, these belief systems.

In summary, the key themes and ideas for incorporating occult symbolism and esoteric elements into a screenplay based on the Antichrist character involve the use of inverted symbols, sigils, numerology, alchemy, theurgy, and references to specific esoteric teachings. By intertwining these symbols and concepts within the narrative, we can establish the character's connection to a higher, hidden knowledge and create a multi-layered story that prompts viewers to engage in deep contemplation to uncover its true meaning.
