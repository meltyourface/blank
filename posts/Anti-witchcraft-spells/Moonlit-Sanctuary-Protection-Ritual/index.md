## Aegis of the Moonlit Sanctuary

**Mystic symbols of safeguard**: Triquetra, Pentacle, Eye of Horus, and the Helm of Awe.

Embodied within this ancient rite, the Aegis of the Moonlit Sanctuary,
An ode to mystic elements, intent on pure protection.
When moonbeams touch the heavens and the waxing moon draws near,
Gather round Triquetra, Pentacle, Eye of Horus, and the Helm of Awe in clear.

Begin by drawing sacred symbols 'round your cherished dwelling,
As your voice utters the harmony in rhymes compelling:
"Triquetra binds the trinity, a balance to ensure,
Earth and Air, Water and Fire, and Spirit to endure."

"At center lies the Pentacle, the star to guide and aid,
Five elements in place unite, their strength invoked and made.
Eye of Horus shall ever watch, an ancient guardian's gaze,
Repelling darkness, casting out, malice set ablaze."

"Helm of Awe, a rune of might, its power undeniable,
Fearsome to the wicked ones, protection undefiable.
Together these ancient symbols form the basis of our shield,
Their energies converge and forge a fortress none shall yield."

Now light the candles 'round the symbols, one of each element, in a circle,
Invoke the spirits of nature and protection, words of power now to hurdle:
"Spirits of the Earth and sky, of Water running deep,
Of Fire's eternal blaze, and Spirit's strength to keep,
Circle round, build the barrier, unleash protective flow,
Bind this dwelling in a sanctuary, let evil dare not go."

As the night embraces the waxing moon's ascent,
The lunar power within your incantation be lent.
Chant the rhymes with force, conviction, and purpose clear,
For the moon will amplify your words, confirming she is near.

With the ritual complete, the barrier shall grow stronger,
Banishing malignant forces, no longer they shall linger.
The Aegis of the Moonlit Sanctuary, your dwelling now defends,
Safeguarding it from sorcery and sinister intents.
