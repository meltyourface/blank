Answer: In various occult practices, Hekate is both a goddess of witches and associated with aspects like protection, knowledge, and transformation, thus making her altar-worthy.

**Explanation**: Hekate, also known as Hecate, is an ancient goddess who has deep roots in ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, with her origins dating back to at least the 8th century BC. Her influence and relevance have persisted throughout history, extending into modern esoteric and occult practices such as Wicca, witchcraft, and ceremonial magic.

Hekate has been associated with many aspects and roles, making her a complex figure in mythology and the occult. Although Hekate is often connected to lunar symbolism, it is not an exclusive association; she is also known as a chthonic deity, linked to the underworld and earthbound forces. Additionally, she is not solely recognized as a guardian of the crossroads, reflecting a more complex and multifaceted role within various esoteric traditions.

As a goddess of witches, Hekate is often associated with magical practices, knowledge, and the guidance of those who seek her wisdom. She is believed to have the power to grant access to hidden or secret knowledge, as well as bestow her protection over those who invoke her. This makes Hekate an important figure for those who work with magic, as well as suitable for dedicating an altar in her honor.

Hekate is also connected to transformation and change. In mythology, she is known for guiding Demeter through the underworld as she searched for her daughter Persephone â€“ a story symbolic of personal transformation and growth through adversity. In this sense, Hekate embodies the idea of navigating through challenging times or navigating the darker realms of one's own psyche.

Given Hekate's rich and extensive history and her association with witchcraft, magic, protection, knowledge, and transformation, it is clear that she fulfills the criteria necessary to be deemed an altar-worthy deity in various occult practices. The complexity and depth of her mythology and symbolism make her a compelling figure to study, connecting her practitioners to ancient wisdom and the transformative power of the esoteric.
