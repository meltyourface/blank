The correct answer is: Hekate is the personification of both the light and dark aspects of the Moon's cycle, symbolizing transitions and gateways.

The rationale for this answer lies in understanding Hekate's complex nature and her role in various occult traditions. Hekate is an ancient Greek goddess often associated with magic, witchcraft, necromancy, and the underworld. She is considered a liminal figure with far-reaching influence in both the material and spiritual realms.

Contrary to the first statement, Hekate does not solely represent the dark aspects of the Triple Goddess archetype. The Triple Goddess, often depicted as the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone, encompasses the entire spectrum of feminine experience. While Hekate is sometimes associated with the Crone aspect - representing wisdom, transformation, and mystery - she embodies much broader principles than just the darkness.

As for the second statement, while Hekate does provide protection against malevolent spirits, this is not her primary function in the occult arts. Hekate is worshiped as a goddess who offers guidance in navigating the unknown, seeking knowledge, and making decisions â€“ not solely in the context of protection.

The fourth statement is also incorrect, as Hekate's influence extends far beyond Wicca. She is revered in many different magical traditions, including ceremonial magic, Hellenic polytheism, and various forms of contemporary witchcraft. Her importance in the occult arts is not limited to one specific practice or belief system.

Hekate's personification of light and dark aspects of the Moon's cycle highlights her multifaceted nature. In her role as the keeper of the keys to the underworld, she is a guide to the mysteries of life, death, and rebirth. Transitions and gateways are an essential aspect of her symbolism, as she facilitates movement between different realms and stages of existence.

In conclusion, Hekate's association with transitions, gateways, and the duality of light and darkness in the Moon's cycle establishes her as a powerful figure in occult practice. Understanding her multifaceted nature and influence in various traditions demonstrates the depth of her role in the esoteric arts.
