## The Entered Apprentice: Foundations of the Occult and Esoteric Path

### Chapter 1: Symbolism in the Entered Apprentice Degree

The Entered Apprentice is the first degree in the esoteric and occult tradition. The candidate embarks on a lifelong journey of self-improvement, spiritual development, and understanding deep philosophical truths. Each of the three degrees that make up the tradition contains its own unique symbols, which are powerful tools of self-discovery.

In the Entered Apprentice degree, a variety of symbols carry significant importance. The Square and Compasses represent the moral and spiritual elements of a candidate's life, with the Square symbolizing the importance of acting upon the knowledge gained, and the Compasses, guidance in discovering boundaries.

The rough ashlar and perfect ashlar represent the potential for growth and transformation within the candidate. The rough ashlar signifies the unrefined state, while the perfect ashlar alludes to the cultivated self, having undergone the Entered Apprentice's journey.

### Chapter 2: Rituals and Moral Teachings

Rituals performed in the Entered Apprentice degree are designed to instill moral teachings and underscore the importance of truth, integrity, and self-discipline.

Essential rituals include:
1. The Obligation: Here, the candidate takes a sacred oath to uphold the teachings of the Entered Apprentice degree and remain loyal to the brethren. This establishes trust and forms a strong bond between a candidate and the fraternity.
2. The Hoodwink: The candidate is blindfolded during initiation to symbolize darkness and ignorance before experiencing the light of knowledge.

Key moral teachings include:
1. Brotherly Love: Cultivating compassion and kindness towards others, transcending interpersonal differences.
2. Relief: Offering assistance and support to those in need, regardless of their status or background.
3. Truth: Holding oneself to the highest standards of honesty and integrity in all aspects of life.

### Chapter 3: Candidate Preparation and Initiation Process

As the first step on the esoteric and occult journey, the Entered Apprentice degree requires candidates to undergo a thorough preparation process. It involves both practical and spiritual elements.

The practical preparation comprises:
1. Developing a basic understanding of the esoteric and occult fraternity as well as its moral values and principles. Such knowledge helps candidates determine whether the path aligns with their desires and beliefs.
2. Composing a petition to join the fraternity â€“ an essential ritual that calls for introspection and self-assessment.

The spiritual preparation involves:
1. Embracing personal growth and transformation through self-reflection and meditation.
2. Aligning oneself with the virtues of brotherly love, relief, and truth, thereby fostering an attitude of humility and service.

Upon completion of the preparation stage, an investigated committee contacts the candidate for an interview. Once deemed suitable, the candidate undergoes initiation. The initiation process consists of ritualistic ceremonies that delve into the esoteric and occult's knowledge and wisdom.

Conclusion

The Entered Apprentice degree serves as the foundation for a candidate's esoteric and occult journey. By understanding and practicing its symbols, rituals, and moral teachings, the apprentice develops a strong grasp of the philosophical concepts. With an open heart and a commitment to spiritual growth, the Entered Apprentice sets forth confidently on a path of lifelong learning, personal transformation, and unwavering determination.
