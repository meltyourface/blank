## The Entered Apprentice's Guided Astral Alignment 

Introduction:
Welcome, Entered Apprentice, to the guided astral alignment, a meditation ritual specifically tailored for your current degree and development. This ritual will allow you to align your chakras, deepen your connection with Masonic symbols, and strengthen your bond to the astral plane within the esoteric framework of Freemasonry. 

Preparation:
Find a quiet space where you will not be disturbed, and settle yourself into a comfortable seated position. Ensure you have properly purified yourself by washing your hands and face, symbolizing the cleansing of your soul. Begin by taking three deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. As you breathe, visualize all thoughts and worries leaving your body, preparing your mind for the journey ahead.

Alignment of Chakras:
1. Base Chakra (Muladhara) - Root 
Visualize a red glowing light at the base of your spine. Set your intention to ground yourself and connect with the inner foundation of your being. Reflect on the importance of establishing a strong foundation in your Masonic journey, as symbolized by the rough and perfect ashlars.

2. Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana) - Creation and Balance
Focus on a vivid orange light below your navel. Meditate on the creative energies within you and how they can be channeled in your journey. Contemplate the balance between the passions and virtues, as represented by the point within the circle.

3. Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) - Personal Power
Envision a bright yellow light in the area of your diaphragm. Reflect on your personal power, symbolized by the square and compass, as well-educated reason guiding your actions.

4. Heart Chakra (Anahata) - Love and Compassion
Imagine a vibrant green light in the center of your chest. Meditate on the virtues of love and compassion, as taught by Masonic principles. Contemplate the precious bonds between brothers and the joined hands that signify the sanctity of unity.

5. Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) - Communication and Truth
Visualize a soothing blue light at your throat. Focus on the importance of honest communication and the relentless search for truth. Reflect on the significance of the plumb rule and the importance of speaking uprightly and justly to yourself and your fellow initiates.

6. Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) - Intuition and Perception
Concentrate on an indigo light in the center of your forehead. Meditate on sharpening your intuition and expanding your perception. Connect these principles with the all-seeing eye's representation of divine knowledge and wisdom.

7. Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) - Spiritual Connection
Imagine a brilliant violet light at the top of your head. Focus on your growing spiritual connection within Freemasonry, and your relationship with the Grand Architect of the Universe. Allow this connection to embrace all preceding chakras and bring harmony and balance to your entire being.

Connection to Masonic Symbolism:
As you bask in the aligned energy of your chakras, reflect on the Entered Apprentice teachings and your connection to the Masonic symbolism. Visualize yourself within a sacred Masonic temple, surrounded by the depictions of the square and compass, the pillars, and other mystical symbols. Meditate on the meaning of each symbol, their incorporation into your daily life, and your contribution to the betterment of humanity.

Astral Plane Bonding:
Now that your chakras have been aligned and your connection to Masonic symbols has deepened, shift your focus to the astral plane. Allow your awareness to drift through the veil between the physical and the ethereal. Visualize yourself traversing the celestial sphere, exploring the essence of Freemasonry and the astral landmarks that represent its teachings. Take this time to strengthen your bond to the astral plane and receive guidance and enlightenment.

Obligations and Duties Reflection:
Before concluding your meditation, take a moment to reflect upon your obligations and duties as an Entered Apprentice. Consider your behavior towards your lodge brothers, your commitment to acquiring knowledge, and your dedication to self-improvement within the Masonic framework.

Closing:
As your meditation journey comes to an end, focus on your breath, taking three deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Feel the divine energy from your aligned chakras radiating throughout your entire being. Gently bring your awareness back to your physical self, and when you are ready, slowly open your eyes.

May your journey through the Entered Apprentice degree and your bond with the astral plane be ever rewarding and enlightening. So mote it be.
