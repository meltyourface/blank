The intersection of the predetermined attributes of an astral entity's hierarchy, cultural origin, and assigned cosmic plane is a fascinating and intricate subject in the study of the esoteric and occult. To fully appreciate and comprehend this, we must first explore the fundamental aspects and core elements that make up these attributes. This deeper understanding would provide initiates with the necessary wisdom to enhance their spiritual growth and form purposeful alliances with chosen astral entities.

1. **Hierarchy**: Astral entities are often categorized and stratified within an established hierarchical structure. This order is based on their relative power, knowledge, and influence within the astral realm. Higher-level entities possess greater wisdom and authority and are often considered to be the gatekeepers to specific cosmic vibrations or energies. The key principle here is that an initiate should be aware of the hierarchical standing of an astral entity to properly align with and gain from the essence of those entities' abilities and foresight.

2. **Cultural Origin**: Astral entities are frequently associated with specific mythologies, folklore, or religious undertones manifested through the lens of regional or cultural worldviews. Examining the cultural origin of an entity can provide crucial insights into the archetypes, symbolism, and attitudes that effectively govern the context in which they operate. An initiate should thus become familiar with the cultural origin of an entity to derive the most suitable wisdom and knowledge from their interaction.

3. **Assigned Cosmic Plane**: The cosmic plane refers to the vibrational residence of an astral entity, the realm which they inhabit, and their spiritual orientation. Different planes possess varying frequencies and energy states, which likewise influence the behavior and expressiveness of these entities. Understanding the cosmic plane of an astral being grants initiates a more thorough comprehension of the entity's fundamental nature, motivations, and the pathways to access the specific knowledge or energy which is their specialty.

To address the intersection of these attributes, it is essential to consider that an astral entity's hierarchy, cultural origin, and assigned cosmic plane are characterized by complex associations and interwoven relationships. These predetermined attributes act as defining aspects that shape, influence, and intertwine the existences of astral entities in ways that can be challenging to decipher.

By examining all three elements, initiates gain a comprehensive understanding of the astral entities under scrutiny, allowing them to adapt and align their intentions, spiritual goals, and energy with these beings. This alignment is a fundamental requirement in forming purposeful alliances with astral entities for mutual growth and advancement.

The spiritual growth and wisdom that this intersection has to offer is genuinely transformational in several ways:

1. By carefully observing the hierarchical structure, initiates learn the appropriate approach, respect, and level of dedication to employ in their interactions with astral entities, ultimately helping them establish a deep partnership.

2. Through delving deeper into the cultural origin and the mythological framework of an astral entity, initiates cultivate a broader contextual understanding of their beliefs and enable them to access more profound spiritual wisdom.

3. And finally, by comprehending the nature of an assigned cosmic plane and the energy state of an astral entity, initiates become capable of effectively discerning, integrating, and utilizing the spiritual energies that emerge through their alliance with these entities.

In conclusion, the intersection of an astral entity's hierarchy, cultural origin, and assigned cosmic plane forms a rich and complex tapestry of meaning, influence, and wisdom. By studying and understanding these attributes, initiates can greatly enhance their spiritual growth by forming purposeful alliances with chosen astral entities. It is through these associations that initiates not only imbibe the knowledge and experience of cosmic entities but also unravel and unveil the mysteries of the cosmos and their place within it.
