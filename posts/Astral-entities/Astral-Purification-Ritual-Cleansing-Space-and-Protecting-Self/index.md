To perform the astral purification ritual, follow the comprehensive method outlined below:
**Step 1**: Preparation
Before you begin the ritual, make sure that the space is physically clean. Remove any clutter, dust, or dirt, as a clean physical environment is essential for a clean astral environment. Ensure you have all necessary items, including protective sigils, candles, incense, crystals, a bell, a bowl of salt water, and a representation of the four elements (fire, water, air, and earth).
**Step 2**: Grounding and Centering
Sit comfortably in the center of the space and close your eyes. Let go of all mundane thoughts and concerns, and focus on your breathing. Once you feel grounded and centered, visualize a protective light surrounding your entire body, strengthening your psychic shielding.
**Step 3**: Casting a Protective Circle
Stand up and draw a circle around the space using the protective sigils. With each sigil, you can say an empowering affirmation to keep the negative energies at bay. This circle will act as a barrier for any malevolent astral entities.
**Step 4**: Elemental Invocations
In the four corners of the room, place the symbols of the four elements. Begin with the east corner for air, then south for fire, west for water, and north for earth. As you place each element, call upon its respective forces to assist in the cleansing process, for example:

"Element of Air, I call upon you to purify this space with the breath of life.
Element of Fire, I call upon you to burn away all negative energies that dwell in this space.
Element of Water, I call upon you to wash away all impurities in this realm.
Element of Earth, I call upon you to ground and protect this space from all harm."
**Step 5**: Astral Purification
Now, light the candles and incense to purify the air and create a sacred atmosphere. Take the saltwater and sprinkle it around the room while chanting a mantra or affirmation of purification, such as:

"By the power of all that is holy and pure, I banish all negativity from this space. Let positive energy flow through, as I cleanse and purify this sacred realm."
**Step 6**: Sonic Cleansing
Ring the bell throughout the space to break up any remaining negative energies and encourage positive vibrations. Pay special attention to corners and other areas where energy might stagnate.
**Step 7**: Finalizing the Ritual
When you feel confident that the space has been thoroughly cleansed, close the ritual by thanking the elemental forces and any other entities you may have called upon for their assistance. Extinguish the candles and incense, and dispose of the saltwater safely. Visualize the protective circle dissipating, and take a moment to ground yourself once more.
**Step 8**: Regular Maintenance
To keep the space purified, it's essential to maintain a positive atmosphere and perform regular cleansing rituals as needed. This may include smudging with sage, sprinkling saltwater, or placing protective crystals and amulets in strategic locations.

By following this comprehensive method, you will successfully perform an astral purification ritual and cleanse the space from malevolent astral entities while protecting yourself with sigils, elemental invocations, and psychic shielding techniques.
