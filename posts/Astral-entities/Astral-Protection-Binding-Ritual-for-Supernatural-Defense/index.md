excerpt: > 
  Conjure and execute a binding ritual specifically utilizing the astral energies and entities as guardians, to ward off supernatural negativity and malevolent forces. Incorporate a series of complex and intricate incantations, sigils, and sacred geometry to amplify the protection. Additionally, experiment with diverse combinations of elements within the Astral realm, such as the usage of ethereal crystals and resonant frequencies, to further establish a formidable barrier against any harmful intentions or entities.

To complete the binding ritual, I will follow these steps:
**Step 1**: Preparation
First, I will cleanse the area where the ritual will be performed. This is essential to clear any residual energy that could interfere with the ritual's effectiveness. Using a combination of sage, lavender, and palo santo, I will purify the environment. Next, I will cast a protective circle with salt or white chalk, to create a boundary.
**Step 2**: Invocation
To invoke the appropriate astral entities as guardians, I'll perform the following incantation, drawing upon the energies of the universe and addressing them directly:

"Oh luminous beings of the astral plane,
Guardians of Netherea and Seraphim reign,
Hear my call as I invoke your name,
To shield us from darkness and untamed."
**Step 3**: Sigils and Sacred Geometry
In the center of the circle, I will place symbols known to channel and amplify astral energies. By writing each sigil with intention, the energy of each symbol is activated and enhanced. For this ritual, I'll use the following sigils:

1. The Archangel Metatron's Cube
2. The Sigil of the Guardian
3. The Flower of Life
**Step 4**: Element Combination
Incorporating ethereal crystals into the ritual will serve to amplify the protective barrier further. Place an amethyst, clear quartz, and black tourmaline in strategic positions around the circle, in alignment with the vertices of the Flower of Life. These crystals have been chosen for their unique ability to aid in astral protection and enhance the connectivity to other realms.

Additionally, resonant frequencies can aid in raising the vibrational energy of the area. Using a set of tuning forks calibrated to the Solfeggio Frequencies, particularly 741 Hz, strike them gently to create the desired resonance.
**Step 5**: Binding and Sealing the Ritual
To bind the energies and seal the protection, recite the final incantation:

"Astral Guardians, lock the shield tight,
Protect our space day and night,
Frail be the force that tries to break,
Desire ill-will will find no gate."

With this incantation, execute this energetic command:

As above, so below, as within, so without.
**Step 6**: Closing
Finally, thank the astral entities and the energies you have invoked. Tell them to depart in peace, maintaining the protection you have just set up:

"Guardians of light, from realms unseen,
Thank you for your aid and the protection bestowed,
Return now, in peace, to your ethereal abode,
May our bond stay strong and our paths cross again in need."

With this, close the circle by walking counterclockwise and erasing any visible lines or marks created during the ritual. The binding ritual is now complete, and your space should be protected by astral guardians against supernatural negativity and malevolent forces.
