Having extensively studied and collaborated with the Hidden Folk, I have uncovered an expansive inventory of flora instrumental in the creation of potent elixirs, talismans, and enchanted poultices. In safeguarding their secrets, the Hidden Folk have underlined the importance of ethical harvesting and conservation of these natural wonders. Herein lies a curated collection of select herbs, their associated occult properties, and their applications in historical and legendary contexts:

1. Mandragora - The Mandrake Root
Habitat: Native to the Mediterranean region and Southern Europe
Ethical Harvesting: Harvested post-autumn, with a ritualized offering to thank the plant spirits.

Occult Properties: Amplifies magical potency, enabling practitioners to access hidden realms, induce potent love spells, and increase psychic abilities.
Optimal Usage: Dried and ground into a powder for use in rituals, or as a key ingredient in elixirs and talismans.
Historical Applications: Legendary sorceress Medea utilized Mandrake to enchant her rival, winning the infamous Golden Fleece.

2. Artemisia - Mugwort
Habitat: Found across temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa
Ethical Harvesting: Gather at the peak of summer, leaving an adequate portion for the plant's self-regeneration.

Occult Properties: Enhances astral travel and lucid dreaming, provides protection during occult practices, and aids in divination.
Optimal Usage: Use in smudging rituals, as components in dream pillows, or prepare as an infusion for consumption.
Historical Applications: Renowned Dr. John Dee, occultist and advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, believed Mugwort enhanced his prophetic abilities.

3. Convallaria - Lily of the Valley
Habitat: Europe, North America, and temperate regions of Asia
Ethical Harvesting: Harvest just before the flowers bloom, showing gratitude to the plant with a small gift.

Occult Properties: Restores emotional balance, invokes happiness and contentment, and ushers in new beginnings.
Optimal Usage: Employ in elixirs and poultices or incorporate into rituals for the purification of sacred spaces.
Historical Applications: Associated with mythical figures like Persephone and St. George, renowned for their triumphs over adversity.

4. Hyoscyamus - Henbane
Habitat: Common throughout Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia
Ethical Harvesting: Approach with caution due to toxicity. Harvest while reciting invocations to banish malevolent spirits.

Occult Properties: Enables scrying and clairvoyance, assists in understanding past lives, and promotes necromantic communication.
Optimal Usage: Infuse in oils and elixirs, but never ingest. Employ as part of meditative practices and rituals.
Historical Applications: Henbane has been referenced in ancient texts like Homer's Odyssey as a plant possessing supernatural powers.

In combining these mystical herbs, it is critical to responsibly nurture and protect their natural habitats. By meticulously adhering to the teachings of the Hidden Folk, practitioners can fine-tune the art of creating potent elixirs, talismans, and poultices. Delve deeply into the past and remain open to the wisdom and teachings of the ancient masters while exploring the unseen world.
