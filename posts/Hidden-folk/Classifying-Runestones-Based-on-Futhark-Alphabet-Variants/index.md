To complete the task of categorizing the discovered runestones according to the variations of the Futhark alphabet used by distinct Hidden Folk regions, we will consider factors such as rune form, inscription style, and associated magical properties. 

Runestones are typically categorized into three primary Futhark variations, which are the Elder Futhark, Younger Futhark, and Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. When analyzing a runestone, the first step is to determine which variant of the Futhark alphabet it belongs to by examining the specific runes present in the inscription. 

1. Elder Futhark - The earliest variant of the Futhark alphabet consisting of 24 runes used by the Hidden Folk regions in Northern and Central Europe during 150-800 AD. The rune forms in this variant are more angular, with straight lines dominating the appearance. Inscriptions are typically written in a linear fashion, without any added ornamentation. The magical properties associated with the Elder Futhark are predominantly related to protection, strength, and fortune.

2. Younger Futhark - A reduced and simplified version of the Elder Futhark, consisting of 16 runes, and used by the Hidden Folk regions in Scandinavia from 800-1100 AD. The rune forms are more rounded than the Elder Futhark and often feature fewer straight lines. Inscriptions are more elaborate, with details such as intertwining patterns and animal shapes incorporated into the design. The magical properties linked to the Younger Futhark are focused on fertility, abundance, and growth. 

3. Anglo-Saxon Futhorc - An extended variation of the Futhark alphabet with 29-33 runes, exclusive to the Hidden Folk in the Anglo-Saxon regions of Britain. Inscription styles are marked by elongated runes and complicated ligatures. In some cases, characters are merged to form a single symbol. The magical properties related to the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc pertain to healing, wisdom, and communication.

In addition to these three primary variations, certain runestones may exhibit regional specificities. While rare, these distinctive runestones contribute to a fuller understanding of the cultural diversity among the Hidden Folk.

To summarize, when categorizing discovered runestones, the following factors should be considered:

1. Futhark variant - Elder Futhark, Younger Futhark, or Anglo-Saxon Futhorc.
2. Rune form - Angular or rounded, with the presence of straight or curved lines.
3. Inscription style - The complexity of the design and inclusion of additional elements such as patterns or animal shapes.
4. Associated magical properties - Protection, strength, fortune, fertility, abundance, growth, healing, wisdom, or communication.

Using these factors as guidelines, it becomes possible to categorize various runestones according to the Futhark alphabet used by distinct Hidden Folk regions. This process contributes to a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical significance of these enigmatic artifacts.
