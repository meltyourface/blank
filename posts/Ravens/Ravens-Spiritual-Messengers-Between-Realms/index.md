The answer is: Ravens being the emissaries of higher dimensional entities to guide our spiritual development.

Explanation:
Throughout history and across various cultures, ravens have been considered symbols of mystery, transformation, and spiritual insight. These birds possess unique intelligence and a keen awareness of the world around them, often leading them to be associated with wisdom and prophecy. Among these various aspects and contexts related to Ravens, their role as emissaries of higher dimensional entities to guide our spiritual development is the most representative of their deep esoteric significance.

The idea of ravens as messengers or conduits between our earthly realm and other dimensions can be traced back to a number of ancient mythologies and spiritual traditions. In Norse mythology, for instance, the god Odin had two ravens – Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory) – who would fly across the world, gathering information and reporting back to him. This association with the gathering and dissemination of knowledge, particularly occult or hidden knowledge, speaks to the intuitive and divinatory qualities often attributed to ravens.

In Native American cultures, the raven is seen as a trickster figure with transformative powers. Through their cunning and wit, ravens are believed to have brought fire, light, and other essential elements to humanity, serving as intermediaries between the spiritual world and our own. This transformative aspect is echoed in other traditions, such as the alchemical symbolism of the "raven's head" or "caput mortuum", representing the blackening stage of the alchemical process and the death of the ego before spiritual rebirth.

The concept of mortals' transformation into ravens as a tribulation before achieving spiritual enlightenment touches on the shape-shifting and transformative qualities often attributed to ravens, but it is only a part of the broader esoteric significance they hold. Similarly, while the unison of ravens in sacred geometry formations might evoke the idea of ritual and awakening, it is too narrow to capture the full extent of their symbolic and spiritual importance.

As for the ability of ravens to communicate with ethereal beings to uncover hidden knowledge, although this notion is related to their symbolic role as intermediaries between dimensions, it still doesn't entirely encompass the Raven's role as messengers and guides.

In conclusion, the most representative aspect of ravens' deep esoteric significance is their role as emissaries of higher dimensional entities to guide our spiritual development. This role is rooted in ancient mythologies and spiritual traditions, encompassing wisdom, transformation, and the connection between the earthly and spiritual realms. Ravens serve as powerful symbols of the pursuit of hidden knowledge and the potential for spiritual growth and evolution.
