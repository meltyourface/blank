Translation:

The Sworn Book of Waer-loga, Chapter 7: Summoning and Conversing with Otherworldly Entities

1. Prepare a sacred space, cleansed by water or purified by fire, by casting a circle in the manner of Waer-loga, marking it with the symbols of the great Arcane Masters.

2. Light candles of white and black to illuminate the circle, representing the opposites that govern this world and others, and to create harmony in which the spirits will convene.

3. Place the Sigil of Valta, drawn on parchment or inscribed on a flat stone, at the heart of the circle as a focal point for the summoned spirits to anchor upon.

4. Chant the Invocation of Waer-loga, drawing power from the four cardinal elements and the energies that flow throughout the cosmos:

"By the Air that connects the heavens, the Earth that roots our being,
By the Fires that embolden us and the Waters that purify our essence,
I invoke Thee, O Spirits of the Waer-loga! Lend me your wisdom and reveal the secrets hidden beyond the veil!"

5. When the entities arrive, address them with respect, beginning the dialogue with an offering or an expression of gratitude and humility. Remember, their knowledge is a gift they choose to bestow upon you.

6. Engage only in a focused line of inquiry, asking clear questions that garner wisdom or assistance in achieving your desired outcome, lest the entities become unyielding and dismissive.

7. Upon the completion of the discourse, bid the entities farewell with grace, offering your heartfelt gratitude for their insights and blessings.

8. Close the circle by erasing the symbols drawn or removing the items employed in the ceremony, expressing gratitude to the forces that enabled the encounter.

Contextual Analysis:

The 15th-century grimoire "The Sworn Book of Waer-loga" presents a synthesis of esoteric and pagan traditions with elements of Christian mysticism. This passage outlines the principles of Waer-loga, which guided the seeker toward the attainment of wisdom and a harmonious relationship with the cosmos. The ritual combines symbolism, invocation of the elements, devotion to the spirits, and the balanced duality of light and darkness.

The act of summoning and conversing with otherworldly entities was an integral part of the practice of Waer-loga, granting the practitioner knowledge of hidden secrets, assistance in realizing their goals, and attuning them to the natural forces of the cosmos. The ritual's emphasis on harmony and respect for the spirits reflects an egalitarian and cooperative approach to engaging with otherworldly forces, one which diverges from the more hierarchical and commanding nature of contemporary Christian-based approaches to evocation.

In Waer-loga, the practitioner sought to understand their place within the universe, embodying wisdom gained through the footsteps of their ancestors and the communion with otherworldly entities. The cultural significance of the ritual demonstrates a deep desire for connection to the world beyond the physical plane, recognizing the interconnectedness of all things and the value of the hidden knowledge these spirits possessed.
