To fully respond to the given knowledge challenge, we must first lay a strong foundation of understanding of the key figures, their relationships, and the historical context in which these events occurred. In this case, we will discuss Catherine Deshayes, also known as La Voisin, her clientele among the French nobility, the role of alchemy in the Affair of the Poisons, and ultimately, how these factors influenced the perception of occultism in 17th-century France and contributed to the broader discourse regarding the dangers of esoteric practices.

Catherine Deshayes, commonly known as La Voisin, was a French fortune teller, and a reputed poisoner during the reign of King Louis XIV in the late 17th-century. Her ability to perform abortions and concoct love potions, poisons, and various magical remedies to aid her clients in fulfilling their desires, notably gained her a wide following among the French aristocracy. La Voisin's dealings in the occult brought her into contact with alchemy, which was an essential aspect of the broader cultural climate that allowed for the Affair of the Poisons to unfold as it did.

Apart from fortune-telling, La Voisin was also heavily involved in alchemy, a medieval philosophical and protoscientific tradition aimed at the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, the creation of an elixir of immortality, and the discovery of a universal panacea. As a part of her alchemical practices, she sought the Philosopher's Stone, which was believed to have the power to turn cheaper metals into gold. This connection to alchemy created a sense of mystique around her services and made her all the more appealing to the elites who sought her out.

The Affair of the Poisons, which unfolded between 1677 and 1682, was a major scandal in France during the reign of King Louis XIV. It involved a series of events rooted in accusations, arrests, and executions of individuals who were believed to have poisoned prominent members of the nobility. Central to this scandal was La Voisin and her wide network of accomplices, which included other fortune-tellers, alchemists, and so-called witches who provided various services to the French court, including the provision of poisons to royalty and aristocrats.

La Voisin's most infamous clientele included Marie Madeleine d'Aubray, Marquise de Brinvilliers, who was responsible for poisoning her father and two brothers, as well as the royal mistress, Athenais de Montespan, who sought Voisin's assistance in her attempts to gain and maintain favor with King Louis XIV. Their involvement in the Affair of the Poisons highlighted the intimate connections between these members of the French aristocracy and the world of the occult.

This entire episode deeply impacted the perception of occultism in 17th-century France, as the events exemplified how a fascination with the esoteric could lead to dangerous and deadly consequences. It led to increased scrutiny by authorities and contributed to a marked shift in the broader discourse regarding the dangers of esoteric practices. As a result, occult practices became increasingly stigmatized, and the French monarchy took significant steps to distance itself from any associations with these practices.

In conclusion, the intricate web of connections between Catherine Deshayes (La Voisin), her clientele among the French nobility, and the role of alchemy in the Affair of the Poisons, demonstrates the interconnectedness and influence of occult practices on 17th-century French society. These entwined relationships not only contributed to the scandalous nature of the events but also sparked a profound change in the perception of occultism in France. The Affair of the Poisons highlighted the potential dangers of esoteric practices, leaving a lasting impact on social attitudes towards occultism and, in turn, altering the course of French history.
