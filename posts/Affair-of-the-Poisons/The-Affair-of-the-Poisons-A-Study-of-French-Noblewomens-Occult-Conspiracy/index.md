To address this knowledge challenge, let us first delve into the historical context and background of the Affair of the Poisons, after which we will analyze the network of conspirators, their motivations, and sources of their esoteric techniques. Finally, we will evaluate how these connections affected French society and the broader occult world.

The Affair of the Poisons occurred during the reign of King Louis XIV in France, from 1677 to 1682. It was a scandal that rocked the French court, exposing a criminal network of poisoners, witches, and fortune-tellers, some of whom had ties to nobles and even the King himself. The people involved in the scandal were accused of conducting black masses and engaging in witchcraft practices.

Key Figures:
1. Madame de Montespan, the King's mistress, whose relationship to the poisoning scandal awakened suspicions in the court. She was allegedly involved in the conspiracy out of a desire to maintain her waning influence over the King.
2. Catherine Monvoisin, known as La Voisin, a fortune-teller, and abortionist at the heart of the poison network. She supplied noblewomen with poisons and magical services, including love potions and alleged sorcery to gain or maintain power.
3. Adam Lesage, Marie Bosse, and Marie Vigoreaux, associates of La Voisin. They played significant roles in the distribution of poisons and were involved in black masses and other occult activities.
4. Father Étienne Guibourg, a priest who participated in the black masses conducted by La Voisin, including those involving Madame de Montespan.

Motivations:
The motivations for the conspirators varied from personal gain to desperation. Madame de Montespan wanted to ensure her position as Louis XIV's mistress, while La Voisin and her associates were driven by financial gain and a desire for influence among the nobility. The involvement of clergy like Father Étienne Guibourg likely stemmed from disillusionment with the church and attraction to the occult's forbidden nature. Many of those lesser-involved in the network turned to the occult or poisonous solutions to their problems due to societal pressure and personal desperation.

Sources of Esoteric Techniques:
The esoteric techniques employed by the key figures in the Affair of the Poisons likely had their origins in various sources such as folklore, Gnostic teachings, and ancient grimoires (books of magic). In an era marked by superstition in both the lower and upper classes of society, such texts would have been sought after for their purported insights into the secrets of the universe. Many of the magical techniques and rituals practiced by the conspirators, such as the black masses and casting spells, were in direct opposition to Christian principles, underscoring the dichotomy between the clandestine occult and forbidden practices and mainstream religious beliefs.

Impact on French Society and the Broader Occult World:
The Affair of the Poisons had significant consequences on French society and the occult world. The scandal horrified the public and tarnished the aristocracy's reputation as numerous nobles were implicated in the poisonings and witchcraft. The scandal also led to the Chambre Ardente's formation, an extraordinary court that investigated, tried, and sentenced those found guilty of witchcraft and poisoning. Many people were executed, imprisoned, or exiled as a result.

For the broader occult world, the scandal brought increased attention to and condemnation of esoteric practices. Authorities cracked down on witchcraft and fortune-telling, driving these practices further underground and stigmatizing those involved or believed to be involved. The scandal underlined the dangers of the occult, both for practitioners and those who sought their services.

To summarize, the Affair of the Poisons involved a complex network of conspirators, driven by various motivations and employing a range of esoteric techniques, sourced from folklore, ancient texts, and other teachings – contravening religious orthodoxy. The scandal had significant consequences on French society and the broader occult world, leading to intensified scrutiny, condemnation, and persecution of occult practices and those associated with them. This demonstrated the inherent risks and potential consequences for those involved in the clandestine world of the occult.
