## Chapter 1: Introduction to the Affair of the Poisons (1677-1682)

The Affair of the Poisons was a significant scandal that unfolded in France during the reign of King Louis XIV from 1677 to 1682. As a result, it caused a major turning point in French society's relationship with the occult and esoteric practices like witchcraft, poisoning, and alchemy.

### 1.1 Main Events and Key Figures

The scandal began in late 1677 with the arrest of Madame de Brinvilliers, a high-ranking noblewoman accused of poisoning her husband and two brothers. Her alleged crimes were investigated by Paris' chief of police, Gabriel Nicolas de La Reynie, who uncovered a larger network of poisoners, witches, and alchemists.

Among the most notorious figures involved in the case were two society fortune-tellers, Catherine Monvoisin (known as La Voisin) and Marie Bosse. Both women were arrested and accused of creating and distributing poisons, arranging black masses, and engaging in potion-making for clients seeking personal advancement or revenge.

During the investigation, it was discovered that some members of the aristocracy, including Madame de Montespan, the king's official mistress, were also involved in some of these practices. The licentiousness and corruption among the nobility were seen as a direct result of these occult activities.

### 1.2 Impact on Occult and Esoteric Practices

The revelations of the Affair of the Poisons led to a significant crackdown on occult practices in France. Louis XIV, concerned by the involvement of his court and the potential threat to his power, set up the Chambre Ardente (Burning Chamber), a special court that investigated and persecuted cases related to poisoning, witchcraft, and other forbidden practices. This led to over 200 arrests and 36 executions, including La Voisin and Marie Bosse.

The crackdown also resulted in the public discrediting of alchemy, which was becoming increasingly associated with the creation of poisons, and it began to fall out of favor with intellectuals and scientists who had previously shown interest in its potential applications to medicine and technology.

### Chapter 2: Types of Poisons, Spells, and Rituals

### 2.1 Poisons

During the height of the Affair of the Poisons, multiple poisoning methods were employed. Substances like arsenic, antimony, and mercury were commonly used as they were tasteless and odorless. Some other notable methods involved plant or animal-based compounds like belladonna, aqua tofana, and cantharides also known as the "Spanish fly." These were either administered directly to the victim or covertly added to food and drinks.

### 2.2 Spells and Rituals

Many clients of the poisoners and fortune-tellers sought assistance in enhancing their beauty, reputation, or social position. Love potions were particularly popular, as were curses or destructive charms to bring down rivals. Witches, like La Voisin and Marie Bosse, were believed to be adept in the casting of spells, the preparation of herbal remedies, and the administration of poisons to achieve the desired results.

Black masses, or sacrilegious parodies of the Catholic Mass, were also rumored to have been performed by some of the individuals involved in the Affair of the Poisons. These ceremonies were believed to involve the evocation of demonic forces to manipulate the fate of others, including powerful figures like the king himself.

### 2.3 Society's Perception of Witchcraft and Alchemy

The Affair of the Poisons had a lasting impact on French society's perception of witchcraft and alchemy. The scandal exposed the inner workings of these practices and the dangerous involvement of influential individuals. As a result, the public became more skeptical of occult beliefs and practices that had once been seen as fascinating or potentially beneficial.

This distrust translated into a general shift away from the belief in the power of witchcraft and alchemy, leading to a decline in their prominence in France. However, the legacy of the scandal continued to influence French culture, with fascination towards the darker elements of human nature, particularly in the realms of literature and art, serving as a reminder of this captivating and scandalous period in history.
