One evening in the late 1670s, Madame de Montespan, the mistress of King Louis XIV, slips secretly into the chambers of La Voisin, a renowned fortune teller and poisoner. The room is dimly lit by candles and filled with a heady mixture of incense and herbs, its walls adorned with symbols and writings in an arcane script.

Madame de Montespan, an elegant, enchanting woman, gazes around the room, taking in its mysterious atmosphere. Addressing La Voisin, she speaks in a low, hushed tone.

**Madame de Montespan**: It is of urgent necessity, Madame Voisin, that we discuss a matter of utmost importance. There are... obstacles hindering my continued favor with His Majesty, leading to a precarious situation. You are known to possess certain... remedies for such obstacles.

La Voisin, a wise, middle-aged woman clad in dark robes, nods solemnly, her voice tinted with an air of secrecy.

**La Voisin**: I perceive your predicament clearly, Madame. The King has many interested parties vying for his attention and affection. Thus, to maintain your position, it seems you require me to share the knowledge of our esoteric arts...specifically, the art of removing those who would threaten your favor.

Madame de Montespan's gaze intensifies, her voice barely a whisper.

**Madame de Montespan**: Indeed. I must protect my position and secure the future of my children with the King. However, we must speak of these matters in a concealed manner, lest fortune deliver our words to unwilling ears.

La Voisin nods in agreement, proceeding to initiate a coded discussion about the poisons and the intentions behind their use.

**La Voisin**: Very well. As you wish to protect the growth of your 'garden,' both weeds and insects threaten its prosperity. Insects must be deterred with subtlety and patience.

Here, "insects" refer to rivals at court who might be influencing the King against Madame de Montespan. "Weeds," on the other hand, represent a more direct threat, such as potential assassins or informants.

**Madame de Montespan**: Yes, precisely. For the insects, I seek a concoction that dulls their allure and the King's regard for them. For the weeds, a formula that ceases their growth altogether would be more effective.

**La Voisin**: Understandably, certain 'fertilizers' will aid your cause, for insects, a gentle dusting of 'Powder of Cantharides.' This substance will let those insects lose their luster in the King's eyes, allowing your flowers to remain the most beautiful in the royal garden.

"Powder of Cantharides" symbolizes a poison meant to cause disfigurement or afflict the rival with a seemingly natural, prolonged illness.

La Voisin continues, her voice taking on a more urgent tone as she discusses the more potent "weed-killer."

**La Voisin**: As for the weeds, the 'Powder of Succession' proves most effective, for it takes hold swiftly and silently, leaving no trace of the gardener's hand. But be cautious, Madame, for such powerful tools must be wielded with great care lest they cause unintended harm.

"Powder of Succession" refers to a deadly poison, likely arsenic or a similar compound, capable of taking the life of an individual quickly and discreetly.

Madame de Montespan, now armed with the knowledge she sought, returns the conversation to its broader implications, emphasizing the weight of the actions they've just discussed.

**Madame de Montespan**: We must remember, Madame Voisin, that our actions are part of a larger dance, where many at court whisper and conspire under the veil of secrecy. Our actions may give rise to an era of darkness. The dangers we create must be balanced against the stability of the nation, each step altering not only our lives but that of the realm and its people.

La Voisin nods gravely, acknowledging the truth Madame de Montespan speaks â€“ they are both entangled in the larger web that was the Affair of the Poisons, an intricate tale of deceit, treachery, and ambition that engulfed the highest echelons of the French aristocracy.

Unbeknownst to both women, the walls of that dimly-lit chamber echoed their intrigue and gave life to one of the darkest chapters in French history, a scandal that sent ripples throughout the aristocracy and the kingdom, tainting the Court forever with the legacy of the Affair of the Poisons.
