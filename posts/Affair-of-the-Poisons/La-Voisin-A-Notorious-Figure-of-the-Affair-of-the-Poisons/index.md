Catherine Deshayes Monvoisin (La Voisin)

During the Affair of the Poisons, Catherine Deshayes Monvoisin, also known as La Voisin, was a notorious figure involved in performing black masses and providing poisons to high-ranking individuals. 

The Affair of the Poisons was a scandal that took place in France between 1677 and 1682, during the reign of King Louis XIV. The investigation of this affair revealed that there was a network of poisoners, witches, and fortune-tellers operating in France, and their clientele included members of the nobility, such as Marquise de Montespan, the king's mistress.

Catherine Deshayes Monvoisin was a fortune-teller and practitioner of the dark arts. Born in 1640, she married Antoine Monvoisin, a jeweler, and had two children. After her husband's business failed, she became a fortune-teller to support her family. She eventually started providing other services, such as performing black masses, love potions, and poisons to her clients. 

The black mass was a satanic ritual that involved parodies of the Christian mass and was performed for various purposes, such as to gain power or harm enemies. It is believed that La Voisin conducted several black masses for Marquise de Montespan with the help of a defrocked priest, Étienne Guibourg, to win the king's favor and maintain her status as his mistress.

La Voisin later started working with other accomplices involved in producing and selling poisons. The poisons were made from substances like arsenic, lead, and animal parts, which were then distributed in Paris's underworld to those who sought to harm or eliminate their enemies.

The Marquise de Brinvilliers, also involved in poisoning cases, was not directly related to the Affair of the Poisons, as she was arrested and executed before its investigation began. Cardinal Richelieu, who passed away in 1642, was not connected to the affair either. The Count of Saint Germain, an enigmatic figure in European history known for his supposed alchemy and immortality, also bears no direct connection to the Affair of the Poisons.

In conclusion, Catherine Deshayes Monvoisin—La Voisin—was the notorious individual who conducted black masses and supplied poisons to high-ranking individuals during the Affair of the Poisons. The scandal exposed a dangerous and clandestine network operating within the French society, ultimately leading to La Voisin's arrest in 1679 and her execution by burning in 1680.
