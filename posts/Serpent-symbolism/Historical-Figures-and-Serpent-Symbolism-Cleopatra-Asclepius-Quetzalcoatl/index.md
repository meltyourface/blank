As a skilled master of the esoteric and occult, particularly Serpent symbolism, I have embarked on an investigation into the lives of prominent historical figures who integrated Serpent symbolism into their spiritual teachings, religious doctrines, or esoteric rituals. In this thorough analysis, I have focused on three specific personalities: Cleopatra VII of Egypt, Asclepius of ancient Greece, and Quetzalcoatl of Mesoamerica, examining the distinctive aspects of their endeavors that emphasize the significance of the Serpent.

1. Cleopatra VII (69-30 BC) - Egypt
Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of ancient Egypt, is a key figure who prominently employed Serpent symbolism. Notably, Cleopatra associated herself with the Egyptian cobra â€“ specifically, the Uraeus, a rearing cobra symbol that represented authority, protection, and the divine sovereignty of the Egyptian Pharaohs. It is believed that she used this symbolism to legitimize her rule and connect herself with the goddess Isis, thereby asserting her status as a divine ruler. The Uraeus, often depicted on royal headdresses and sarcophagi, was believed to provide protection and guidance in both life and death. In Cleopatra's case, the Uraeus symbolized her supreme authority, divine favor, and also warned her enemies of her formidable power.

2. Asclepius (circa 1200 BC) - Ancient Greece
Asclepius, a revered healer and legendary figure in ancient Greek mythology, is another important figure who incorporated Serpent symbolism into his teachings and practices. As the god of medicine, Asclepius was often depicted with a serpent-entwined staff, known as the Rod of Asclepius. In ancient Greek culture, serpents held various meanings, such as wisdom, rebirth, and health. Asclepius's association with the Serpent was believed to have originated from his ability to communicate with snakes, receiving their guidance and insights for healing. Moreover, the shedding of a snake's skin was considered a sign of renewal, and, by extension, the promise of restored health and vitality. To this day, the Rod of Asclepius remains a globally recognized symbol of medicine and healing.

3. Quetzalcoatl (circa 10th-16th centuries) - Mesoamerica
Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent deity, was a significant figure in Mesoamerican culture who incorporated Serpent symbolism into his spiritual and religious practices. Revered by the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans, Quetzalcoatl represented the union of earthly and divine realms. As an embodiment of the Serpent and the bird, Quetzalcoatl symbolized the bridge between the earth, sky, and cosmic forces. The Serpent aspect, in particular, signified transformation, wisdom, and spiritual connection, while the feathered elements represented celestial power and heavenly aspirations.

In analyzing these historical figures, it is evident that Serpent symbolism was integrated into various aspects of their lives, often signifying authority, wisdom, and healing. Each figure's culture and tradition shaped the attributes and significance they attributed to the Serpent. In the Egyptian context, the cobra signified power and divine protection. In ancient Greek belief, it represented health and rebirth, while for the Mesoamerican cultures, it signified spiritual transformation and the union of heavenly and earthly powers.

In conclusion, the significance and meaning of Serpent symbolism vary across the histories, teachings, and cultures of Cleopatra VII, Asclepius, and Quetzalcoatl. Nevertheless, these figures each demonstrate the enduring impact of Serpent symbolism within their respective spiritual teachings, religious doctrines, and esoteric rituals.
