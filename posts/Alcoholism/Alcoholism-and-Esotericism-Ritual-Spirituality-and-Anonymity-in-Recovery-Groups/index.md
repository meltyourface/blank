Answer: The belief in a higher power, rituals in maintaining sobriety, and the anonymity of recovery groups

Explanation: Alcoholism as an occult phenomenon is not a widely accepted classification. However, drawing connections between alcoholism and aspects of the esoteric or occult can provide intriguing insights. The answer I chose is primarily informed by the practices and beliefs of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and similar recovery groups.

1. **Belief in a higher power**: Many recovery programs, notably AA, incorporate a spiritual dimension to address the addictive aspects of alcoholism. The program's famous 12-step process highlights the importance of establishing a relationship with a higher power as a crucial component in overcoming addiction. While the higher power need not necessarily be a deity, this focus on spirituality and surrendering to a force beyond oneself resonates with some elements of the occult.

2. **Rituals in maintaining sobriety**: Another connection between alcoholism and the esoteric can be found in the rituals and practices associated with maintaining sobriety. In AA, for example, meetings often open with recitation of the Serenity Prayer and other affirmations. These rituals, although non-religious, can resemble the invocation of higher powers or the use of ritual in esoteric practices to enact change in oneself and the world.

3. **Anonymity of recovery groups**: AA and similar groups' emphasis on the anonymity of their members can also be likened to occult societies, which historically prized discretion and secrecy. This confidentiality helps create a supportive, safe atmosphere for members that fosters trust, just as the secrecy surrounding occult practices is intended to protect members and maintain the integrity of their work.

While the other options mentioned relevant factors associated with alcoholism, they fail to highlight aspects that fit within an occult framework. The choice I made offers the strongest representation of alcoholism's potential connections to esoteric, occult, or secretive practices.
