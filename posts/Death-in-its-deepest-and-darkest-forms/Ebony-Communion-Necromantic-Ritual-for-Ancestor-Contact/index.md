excerpt: > 
  Design a macabre ritual rooted in the dark arts of necromancy, invoking ancient and forbidden practices to commune with deceased ancestors. Carefully select and arrange a set of ritual tools and specific artifacts linked to the ancestral spirits in question, such as personal belongings or bones. Choose the optimal location in which to perform the ritual, drawing upon the ley lines of necromantic energy or at the site of a family burial ground, under the light of a waning moon. Incorporate chants, incenses, and ceremonial postures that enhance the connection to the netherworld, ensuring the ethereal conduit's stability. Moreover, devise means of protection from malevolent entities that may seek to exploit the open gateway, while adequately preparing a sequence of actions needed to close the portal once the desired communication has been established.

## The Ebony Communion: A Macabre Ritual of Necromancy 

### Part 1: Ritual Tools and Specific Artifacts

1. A relic or personal belonging of your ancestors – preferably three items, ideally from three separate people. These items will serve as a connection to your specific bloodline.
2. A human skull, preferably a relative's, to represent the collective consciousness of your ancestors.
3. A black candrumbral - a combination of a candle and drum - made of a mixture of animal fat, beeswax, and nightshade extract that will burn with a deep purple flame.
4. A ceremonial dagger made of bone – for the ritual to have power, it must be a dagger that has been wielded by practitioners in your family for generations.
5. A chalice or drinking cup made from a polished animal skull.
6. A pure silver ring engraved with symbols of protection.
7. A dark leather-bound book containing chants, incantations, and prayers specific to your family's necromantic practices.
8. A mix of sacred incense containing copal resin, wormwood, and powdered bone.

### Part 2: Optimal Location

Find a site either at your family's burial ground or on ley lines of necromantic energy, where your ancestors have been laid to rest. The ritual must be conducted under the light of a waning moon, which symbolizes death, and ushering in of dark powers.

### Part 3: Chants, Incenses, and Ceremonial Postures

1. Begin by igniting the incense and letting its potent aroma fill the air.
2. Light the candrumbral and arrange the personal artifacts in a triangular formation surrounding the skull and the chalice.
3. Don the silver ring and stand in a wide stance, with arms outstretched.
4. Recite the opening incantation from the leather-bound book, harmonizing with the distant echoes of the candrumbral.
5. As you chant, maintain the ceremonial postures passed down through your ancestral line. These postures channel the power of your blood and life force, and they serve as the foundation for the ethereal conduit.

### Part 4: Protection and Gateway Closure

Although opening the gateway may allow you to commune with ancestors, it might also attract malevolent entities. **To safeguard against this, follow these steps closely**:

1. Carve a protective circle in the ground around your ritual space using the bone dagger. The trace should connect the points of the triangular artifact arrangement.
2. Sprinkle a mixture of salt and crushed hematite within the circle to create an impenetrable barrier.
3. Invoke the invoked spirits of your ancestors within the circle at the beginning of the ritual. Their presence will act as an additional deterrent against any unwanted malefic forces.

Closing the portal requires precise timing, as the ritual should not extend past the darkest hour of the night:

1. Once the desired communication is complete, extinguish the candrumbral in chalice and the incense.
2. Carefully erase the protective circle, making sure not to leave any remnants.
3. Thank your ancestors for their guidance and bid them farewell.
4. Perform a brief cleansing chant to nullify residual energies lingering in the ritual space.
5. Pack ritual tools and artifacts so they can be stored securely until their next use.

Upon completing these steps, the gateway between the world of the living and the realm of the ancestors will be sealed, ensuring no malevolent forces can linger or cause harm.
