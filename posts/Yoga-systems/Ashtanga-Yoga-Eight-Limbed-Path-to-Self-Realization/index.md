The Ashtanga Yoga system, also known as the Eight-Limbed Yoga, is a widely practiced and revered branch within the larger context of Yoga systems. Its origins can be traced back to ancient India, where it was first outlined in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, a collection of 196 aphorisms compiled around 400 CE. This system provides a comprehensive roadmap to self-realization and spiritual enlightenment through the integration of the eight limbs (Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi).

1. Yama (Moral Restraints): The first limb, Yama, constitutes five ethical principles that can be observed in daily life: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (continence), and Aparigraha (non-covetousness). These moral restraints provide a solid foundation for one's spiritual journey.

2. Niyama (Observances): Niyama refers to five observances designed to cultivate personal discipline and self-awareness: Saucha (purity), Santosha (contentment), Tapas (austerity), Svadhyaya (self-study), and Ishvara Pranidhana (surrender to a higher power).

3. Asana (Physical Postures): Asana encompasses the physical practice of yoga, comprising postures and sequences aimed at aligning the body, enhancing flexibility, and building strength. Over time, the practice of asanas has evolved to incorporate various styles and modifications suited to individual needs, preferences, and capacities.

4. Pranayama (Breath Control): Pranayama involves the conscious regulation of breath to attain mental clarity and balance the subtle energy within the body. Techniques have been developed to achieve different objectives, such as calming, energizing, or purifying the mind-body complex.

5. Pratyahara (Withdrawal of the Senses): This limb signifies the practice of withdrawing the senses from external stimuli, allowing for greater inward focus and fostering a deeper connection to the self.

6. Dharana (Concentration): Dharana emphasizes the cultivation of single-pointed concentration, which is essential for traversing the higher stages of Yoga.

7. Dhyana (Meditation): The penultimate limb, Dhyana, involves sustained meditation, the uninterrupted flow of consciousness towards the object of concentration.

8. Samadhi (Absorption): In Samadhi, the final stage, the practitioner transcends individual consciousness to attain a state of pure bliss and union with the divine.

Throughout history, the Ashtanga Yoga system has witnessed various adaptations and interpretations by key masters and influential texts. Some notable examples include:

- The Hatha Yoga Pradipika: Authored by Swami Svatmarama in the 15th century, this text delves into the physical and energetic aspects of Yoga, merging Ashtanga principles with Hatha practices such as mudras, bandhas, and kriyas.
- The Shiva Samhita: This text outlines an integrated approach to Yoga through a mixture of Ashtanga and Tantra practices.
- Krishnamacharya and Pattabhi Jois: Influential 20th-century masters whose teachings emphasized vinyasa (flow), where breathing and movement synchronize, culminating in the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga style widely practiced today.

These texts and masters have contributed to shaping the Ashtanga Yoga system and its understanding and practice across different historical periods and socio-cultural contexts. Throughout its evolution, the significance of the eight limbs has remained paramount, offering practitioners a holistic approach to realizing the ultimate goal of union with the divine.
