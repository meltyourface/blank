description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Yoga systems, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a comprehensive Sattvic (balanced and pure) Yogic meal plan for a week, integrating Ayurvedic principles, tailored to each of the three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha). Incorporate a variety of nutrient-rich ingredients and diverse meal options, including five specific recipes with detailed preparation steps for each dosha. Additionally, provide relevant guidelines on the optimal combination of the six Ayurvedic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent) in meals, ideal food timings, and how to promote proper digestion and assimilation of nutrients in the context of Yogic lifestyle practices.

Week-long Sattvic Yogic meal plan for each dosha:

General Guidelines for each dosha
1. Vata: Quell Vata imbalance with warm, moist, and grounding foods.
2. Pitta: Cool and soothe Pitta with mild, refreshing, and lightly spiced foods.
3. Kapha: Stimulate Kapha with light, dry, and invigorating foods.

Incorporate the six Ayurvedic tastes in each meal, for nourishment and satisfaction: sweet (heaviest, grounding), sour (stimulating), salty (hydrating), bitter (detoxifying), pungent (enhancing digestion), and astringent (absorbing, tightening).

To promote proper digestion and assimilation of nutrients, establish a routine around mealtime. Eat your largest meal at midday when the digestive fire (Agni) is strongest, and lighter meals at breakfast and dinner. Avoid snacking or eating large meals late in the evening. Allow a minimum of three hours between meals to support digestion.
