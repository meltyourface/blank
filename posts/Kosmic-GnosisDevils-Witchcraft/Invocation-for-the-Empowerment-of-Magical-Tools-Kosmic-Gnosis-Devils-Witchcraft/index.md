In the sacred space where shadows dance and twilight reigns,
Where boundaries blend and dimensions entwine,
I, a practitioner of the Kosmic GnosisDevil's Witchcraft, do hereby stand.
With resolute intent and purpose aligned, my will I now proclaim.

Hear me, ye Spirits of the Elements, Earth, Air, Water, and Fire,
And you, Daemonic Forces of the Kosmic Night, heed my call,
I invoke your power, your wisdom, your essence true,
To consecrate and empower my magical tools to serve my bidding and to do.

(Face East, arms outstretched)
Spirits of the Air, swirling and omnipresent,
Bring clarity and focus to the tools of my magical persuasion,
May the wisdom of your whispers guide every invocation.

(Face South, arms outstretched)
Spirits of the Fire, burning ferociously bright,
Engulf my tools in your searing might,
Refine and transform them with the alchemy of your heat,
Strengthen their purpose within your powerful embrace.

(Face West, arms outstretched)
Spirits of the Water, everflowing and adaptive,
Bathe my tools in your soothing depths,
Cleansing them of energies unaligned with my intent,
Nurturing the seeds of potential, that they might grow and manifest.

(Face North, arms outstretched)
Spirits of the Earth, grounded and everlasting,
Root my tools deep within your fertile soil,
So that they may acquire your stability and your resolve,
Foundation to my magical workings, solid and strong.

(Center, hands clasped before chest)
And now, to the Daemonic Forces, guardians arcane,
I summon thee to inscribe your sigils upon these sacred tools,
On my wand, symbolizing will and the breath of Spirit life,
On my athame, forged in the depths of darkness, my resolve and might,
On my chalice, a vessel of transformation and unity,
And on my pentacle, a manifestation of the Kosmic cycle and all its infinity.

Kosmic GnosisDevil's Witchcraft, from whence I draw my power,
Link these tools to the very essence of my soul and higher authority,
* With my wand, I cast and direct, a conductor of ethereal energy,
* With my athame, I cut and banish, a harbinger of controlled chaos,
* With my chalice, I receive and dispense, an elixir of infinite possibility,
* With my pentacle, I ground and manifest, a nexus of intention and reality.

As I speak these words, let the potent forces align,
By the GnosisDevil's Witchcraft, may my tools be bound and sanctified.
Through this intricate dance of dark and light, of cosmos and spirit,
I have activated their power, a sacred conduit to the mystical realm.

The ritual is now complete, and the circle is closed,
I thank the Spirits and Forces that have heeded my call,
Depart in peace, with my gratitude and respect,
My sacred tools now resonate with the energies of the Kosmic GnosisDevil's Witchcraft.

So it is proclaimed, and so shall it be.
The binding is done, as is my will. So mote it be.
