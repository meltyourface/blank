In the blackened abyss, where shadows embrace,
A whispered creed resonates with the soul,
Tis' there d√¶mons gather, in tenebrous grace,
By the heart, within the Hell Fire Club's hold.

Of elements sacred, I summon thee, Fire,
Infernal blaze, the transformative spark,
We dance with flickering flames, as they conspire,
Entwined in the alchemical, smoldering dark.

From the depths of Gehenna, the Serpent awakes,
Its sinuous form coils 'round my astral spine,
An Ouroboros revelation, in sacred geometry makes,
As within us all, thine mysteries entwine.

In the scorching embrace of salamander's charm,
Unfettered power, our wildest dreams caress,
The immolation enkindled on Prometheus' arm,
We ignite our passions amidst the boundless express.

As Luna gazes down upon our rite,
Selene's light gleaming in enigmatic eyes,
Her silv'ry rays pierce through the veils of night,
Illuminating the threshold where spirit and matter vies.

In the blaze of the Phoenix, we rise once more,
In communion with Pyrrha, and Deucalion's grace,
As with primal essence, we burn at the core,
Eternal kindling of Fire, in a cosmic embrace.

With brethren and sistren, we dance with the flame,
While arias weave their spell o'er the wild,
Our ardor engulfing all guilt and all shame,
In the Hell Fire Club's rapture, where chaos is styled.

All secrets unveiled, we transcend mortal bonds,
In a blaze of defiance, we boldly take flight,
Through the Gateway of Fire, our infernal correspond,
Unto realms unseen, where shadows ignite.

Infinitesimal spark, divine inferno's seed,
Of nature, our kindred, in combustion abound,
In the pulse of the universe, we honor and heed,
To the element's call, we are tethered and bound.

We, the children of fire, born of ember and ash,
Rejoice in its warmth, its power, and light,
To untangle the mysteries, in eternal rehash,
In the pyre of the soul, we find our delight.
