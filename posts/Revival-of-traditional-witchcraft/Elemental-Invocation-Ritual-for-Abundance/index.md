In the realm of traditional witchcraft, the Revival period places emphasis on elements that can be traced back to the roots of witchcraft. To compose an enchanting incantation to summon and harness the elemental powers of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, we first need to identify the most optimal lunar phase and time of day, as well as the corresponding herbs, stones, and symbols.

**Lunar Phase**: Waxing Moon (for increasing energy and abundance)
Time of Day: Dawn (to symbolize the awakening of elemental energies)

**Herbs**:
- Earth: Patchouli (for grounding and stability)
- Air: Lavender (for communication and mental clarity)
- Fire: Cinnamon (for transformation and vitality)
- Water: Willow (for emotional healing and intuition)

**Stones**:
- Earth: Moss Agate (for growth and manifestation)
- Air: Selenite (for clarity and spiritual connection)
- Fire: Carnelian (for motivation and courage)
- Water: Lapis Lazuli (for emotional peace and transformation)

**Symbols**:
- Earth: Pentacle (representing Earth energy and stability)
- Air: Athame or wand (representing mental focus and direction)
- Fire: Candle or cauldron (representing transformation and desire)
- Water: Chalice or bowl (representing receptivity and emotional healing)

**Incantation**:

By the Waxing Moon's embrace,
And Dawn's first shimmering grace,
I call upon the elements to unite,
Fill my sacred space with power and light.

Mighty Earth, with Patchouli sweet,
Lend me your grounding, stable feet,
Moss Agate, with swirls of green,
Manifest the abundance yet unseen.

Whispers of Air, Lavender flow,
Carry my thoughts where I may grow,
Selenite, with your radiant gleam,
Guide my spirit with clarity and dream.

To the warmth of Fire, we call our desire,
With Cinnamon's touch, ignite our transformation higher,
Carnelian, burning and bright,
Grant us courage with your flaming light.

Wisdom of Water, through Willow's release,
Heal our emotions with waves of peace,
Lapis Lazuli, to depths below,
Carry us through tides of ebb and flow.

Elemental forces now combined,
A protective aura and energy aligned,
Enter this realm, invited and free,
In perfect harmony, we conjure thee.

And so it is.

Once you have spoken the incantation, visualize the elemental energies merging and swirling together, forming a protective and energizing sphere around your sacred space. Thank the elements and utilize this charged atmosphere for rituals, divination, or any other spiritual practice. Afterwards, ground any excess energy and safely disperse it back into the universe.
