In order to fully respond to this knowledge challenge, it is paramount to explore the various facets of Norse magical narrative charms, including their creation and function, as well as their relationship to Norse cosmology. By delving into the Nine Worlds and the Runes within Norse cosmology, we shall illuminate how these aspects can be identified and utilized within the charms to enhance their invocations and outcomes.

To provide context, Norse magical narrative charms, also known as galdrar or galdramál, were invoked spells or incantations that played an essential role in Viking societies. Occupying a unique space in Norse culture, they drew inspiration from Germanic and Icelandic mythologies, incorporating elements of poetic tales, religious beliefs, and magical aspects to produce efficacious results.

Connecting Norse cosmology to the creation and function of Norse magical narrative charms necessitates an understanding of the Nine Worlds, each representing distinctive realms and inhabitants. **Nordic cosmology is composed of the following worlds**:

1. Ásgarðr (Asgard) – The world of the Æsir, the main pantheon of Norse gods.
2. Vanaheimr (Vanaheim) – The home of the Vanir, a separate group of gods associated with fertility and prosperity.
3. Álfheimr (Alfheim) – The world of the Light Elves, beneficial nature spirits.
4. Miðgarðr (Midgard) – The realm of humans.
5. Svartálfaheimr (Svartalfheim) – The home of the Dark Elves, also known as Dwarves, renowned for their craftsmanship and sorcery.
6. Niflheimr (Niflheim) – The primordial realm of mist, fog, and cold, the origin of ice.
7. Múspellsheimr (Muspellheim) – The primordial realm of fire, the origin of heat and light.
8. Jǫtunheimr (Jotunheim) – The land of the giants, often antagonistic to the gods.
9. Hel – The land of the dead, overseen by the goddess Hel.

These worlds are interconnected by the World Tree, Yggdrasil, representing the cosmos' axis. Practitioners of Norse magic would draw inspiration from these worlds and their inhabitants, crafting narrative charms that were specifically tailored to address fundamental aspects of their lives, often invoking the power of the gods, spirits, or ancestors to attain desired outcomes.

Runes, an integral part of Norse cosmology, and the runic alphabets (known as Elder Futhark, Younger Futhark, and Anglo-Saxon Futhorc) served as both letters for communication and symbols for magical purposes. In Norse magical narrative charms, the Runes were harnessed to invoke the inherent power of the words and symbols inscribed in the charm or incantation. Runes were believed to possess inherent spiritual forces, and invoking them in charms would enhance the effectiveness of the spell.

To identify and utilize Runes and the Nine Worlds within Norse magical narrative charms, an adept practitioner would follow these steps:

1. **Selection**: Identify the appropriate Rune(s) and realm(s) to be invoked in the charm. This depended on the desired purpose or outcome.
2. **Invocation**: Craft the charm or incantation to call upon the chosen realm(s) and Rune(s), seeking the attendant power, protection, or blessings.
3. **Transmission**: Communicate the charm through recitation, singing, or even carving onto objects to imbue them with the power of the Rune(s) and the associated realm(s).
4. **Activation**: Perform any necessary rituals, actions or sacrifices to 'awaken' the charm and catalyze the intended outcome.

In summary, the connection between the creation and function of Norse magical narrative charms lies in their deep relationship with Norse cosmology, specifically the Nine Worlds and Runes. Each charm drew potency and efficacy from these worlds and their inhabitants, as well as the inherent spiritual forces found in the Runes. By meticulously selecting, invoking, transmitting, and activating the appropriate Runes and realms, practitioners could enhance the efficaciousness of their magical narrative charms, leading to potent invocations and outcomes.
