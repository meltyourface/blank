## The Rite of Ascension: A Norse Magical Narrative Charm-Based Rite of Passage Ceremony

Introduction: The Rite of Ascension is designed for the contemporary practitioner of Norse magic and tradition, delving into the world of ancient rituals and symbolism to enrich their understanding and connection to their heritage. The ceremony ensures a comprehensive and enriched experience, bridging the gap between ancient practices and modern sensibilities.

Objective: To integrate the seeker into the world of Norse magicians by guiding them through a transformative ritual that blends rune readings, galdr chantings, and seiðr practices.

Preparation:

1. **Cleanse the space**: Use smoke from burning dried herbs like mugwort or juniper to purify the area where the ceremony will take place. Set the intention to create a sacred space for the Rite of Ascension.

2. **Rune Altar**: Create an altar with a cloth representing the seeker's element (earth, air, fire, or water) and place a bowl of water in the center. Arrange the Elder Futhark rune stones clockwise around the bowl and place a candle on each side of it, which will be lit during the ritual.

3. **Seeker's Preparation**: The seeker should wear clothing suitable for the ritual, such as a robe or other loose-fitting, natural-fiber garments. They should also fast and meditate on their intentions and spiritual journey for at least 24 hours before the ceremony.

Ceremony:

1. **Opening Invocation**: The officiant addresses the deities and ancestral spirits relevant to the seeker's lineage and practice and requests their guidance and support throughout the rite.

2. **Rune Reading**: The officiant conducts a rune reading, focusing on the seeker's spiritual journey. The drawn runes shall provide guidance and insight into their future path and empower them during the ceremony.

3. **Galdr Chanting**: The officiant leads the seeker in chanting the names of each rune drawn from the reading, invoking their power and infusing their energy into the seeker's consciousness. The seeker should deepen their trance-like state with each chant, fostering a strong connection to the runes and their power.

4. **Seiðr Practice**: The officiant instructs the seeker to enter a seiðr throne (either a high seat or an elevated platform surrounded by symbols and items related to the practitioner's intent) to channel the energies and spirits during this part of the ritual. The officiant will then lead the seeker through a guided meditation, opening them up to the wisdom of the spirits and runes.

5. **Odinn's Breath**: The officiant breathes upon the seeker's forehead, symbolizing the breath of Odinn, which instills the gift of wisdom and strength.

6. **Marking of the Runes**: The officiant uses a mixture of charcoal and water (or another natural pigment) to draw the runes from the reading upon the seeker's body. This creates a physical and spiritual connection to the runes' energies and marks the integration of the seeker into the world of the Norse magicians.

7. **Closing**: To close the ceremony, the officiant thanks the deities and ancestral spirits for their guidance and support throughout the rite. The seeker extinguishes the candles on the altar, signifying their willingness to embrace their new life as a Norse magician.

Post-ceremony: The seeker should journal their experience, focusing on the insights gained during the ritual, to remember what they learned and hold onto the energy received. It is essential for the practitioner to meditate on their newfound knowledge and continue to explore the Norse magical tradition as they walk their path.
