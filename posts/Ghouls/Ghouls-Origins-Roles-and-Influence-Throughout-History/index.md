2. West Asian and North African Folklore: Ghouls in these regions are frequently portrayed as monstrous, devious spirits that kidnap children, lure travelers into the wilderness, and assume different forms to deceive humans.

Specific Attributes:

1. Shape-shifting: Ghouls often possess the ability to change their appearance, taking the form of animals or humans to trick and deceive their victims.

Sociocultural Factors:

1. Fear of Death: Ghouls embody humanity's fears and anxieties about death and the afterlife, often appearing in folklore as guardians or defilers of graves and burial grounds.
