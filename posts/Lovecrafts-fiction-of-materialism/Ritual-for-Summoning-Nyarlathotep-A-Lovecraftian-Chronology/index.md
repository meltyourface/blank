## Summoning of the Dreaded Nyarlathotep – An Esoteric Chronology

### I. Preparation of the Ritual Setting

1. Locate an area of great geological or meteorological significance – a place where reality is thin and susceptible to intrusion (e.g., a desolate mountaintop, a barren wasteland, or the heart of an ancient forest). A confluence of ley lines or a site of prior cosmic activity is optimal.
   - Significance: In Lovecraft's universe, such locations are where the boundary between dimensions is weak, allowing easier passage for beings like Nyarlathotep.

2. At midnight on the night of a new moon, when the veil between worlds is weakest, cleanse the ritual site through a purification rite. This rite consists of washing the area with an astringent made from the concoction of eldritch herbs such as Valerian root, Hemlock, and Belladonna.
   - Significance: The purification process prepares the area for mystical workings by removing any terrestrial energies that may interfere with the summoning.

### II. Arrangement of Eldritch Symbols

1. Use powdered Ichor, ground from the bones of an ancient leviathan, to inscribe the great sigil of Nyarlathotep at the center of the ritual area; the sigil comprises three concentric circles interlinked by an intricate web of arcane lines.
   - Significance: The sigil serves as a tether to draw Nyarlathotep to our plane, binding the deity's essence to the material world.

2. Surround the central sigil with a Decagon, inscribing each of the ten points with the symbols and names of Nyarlathotep’s known aspects (e.g., The Black Pharaoh and The Faceless God). The symbols should be etched in a reversed pattern from east to west, with a space of precisely 9 feet and 11 inches between them.
   - Significance: The Decagon represents Nyarlathotep's inherently chaotic nature and multitude of forms, as well as securing the ritual site for the arrival of the deity.

### III. Acquisition of Arcane Artifacts

1. Acquire the Key of Nyarlathotep, a relic forged eons ago by the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred. This key opens pathways between dimensions, enabling Nyarlathotep's entrance into the terrestrial realm.
   - Significance: In Lovecraft's mythos, the Key of Nyarlathotep is a symbol of apocalyptic power used to bring about catastrophic change and chaos on Earth.

2. Obtain a vial of Virgin’s Tears, the undiluted essence of grief and despair. Pour the liquid over the sigil, fully submerging the inscriptions.
   - Significance: Virgin’s tears represent unfathomable sorrows besetting those whose minds have been exposed to the nightmarish vistas of Lovecraft’s cosmic deities, especially Nyarlathotep.

### IV. Haunting Incantations

1. With the arcane artifacts in place, begin the incantation drawn from the forbidden texts of the Necronomicon. Recite the Invocation of the Thousand Masks, a harrowing chant that must be whispered in the ancient R'lyehan language, with each verse invoking a different aspect of the Crawling Chaos.
   - Significance: The incantation, echoing the enigmatic languages of the Old Ones, opens a gateway for Nyarlathotep, while the mention of its innumerable masks acknowledges its protean nature.

### V. Final Ascension

Following the incantation's completion, Nyarlathotep will manifest in the ritual's space. The summoner must maintain perfect composure throughout the ritual to contain the deity's chaotic influence, lest they succumb to the horrifying madness that accompanies the Crawling Chaos.
