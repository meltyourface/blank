Knowledge Challenge: In the context of North Western Library's extensive collection on occultism and esotericism, propose a comprehensive connection between two seemingly unrelated philosophies found within the library's trove while also highlighting their shared principles, and explore how an adept might harmoniously integrate these concepts into both personal and initiatory practices.

To respond to this challenge, let us first select two seemingly unrelated philosophies that exist in the warehouse of knowledge within the North Western Library: Hermeticism, with its origins in ancient Egypt and Greece, and Zen Buddhism, a school of Mahayana Buddhism originating in China. We will focus on understanding these philosophies, draw a comprehensive connection between them, and conclude by exploring how an adept might integrate both traditions harmoniously in their practices.

Hermeticism, an esoteric tradition rooted in the writings of Hermes Trismegistus, holds the pursuit of spiritual alchemy, divine wisdom, and self-transformation at its core. The primary text associated with Hermeticism, "The Corpus Hermeticum," comprises a series of teachings on the nature of reality, purpose of existence, and the cosmos itself. One key concept in Hermeticism is the idea of "as above, so below," meaning that what transpires on a microcosmic level (individual or personal) can be extrapolated to the macrocosmic level (world or cosmic events).

Zen Buddhism, on the other hand, engages practitioners in the pursuit of self-realization, awakening, and enlightenment through regular meditation practice and mindfulness of daily life. Founded by the Indian Monk Bodhidharma in the 6th century, this school of Buddhism places emphasis on achieving interconnectedness and the dissolution of dualistic thinking. One main tenet in Zen Buddhism is the concept of non-duality, which suggests that everything is interconnected and that one's experiences are not separate from the world around them.

Despite the differences in their origins and historical contexts, both Hermeticism and Zen Buddhism share key principles that reflect a unifying thread in their teachings. Both traditions encourage self-realization, awakening, and the quest for truth by looking inward and understanding oneself better. Furthermore, both philosophies speak to interconnectedness, where Hermeticism's "as above, so below" parallels Zen Buddhism's non-duality teachings.

An adept seeking to harmoniously integrate these philosophies might start discovering their shared principles in personal contemplation and meditation practices. For example, by meditating on principles like interconnectedness and reflection, adept can reach a deeper understanding of how these concepts connect both Hermeticism and Zen Buddhism. Adopting a non-dogmatic approach, an adept can also study and practice rituals, symbolism, and practices associated with both traditions, seeing each as a complementary tool for self-discovery and inner transformation.

In initiatory practices, the adept might introduce the fusion of Hermeticism and Zen Buddhism by incorporating elements of mindfulness and meditation in their Hermetic rituals or using Hermetic symbolism and concepts within Zen meditation. Such integration could lead to a rich and unique practice that resonates with shared principles between these two distinct philosophies, providing a broader perspective on the spiritual journey.

In conclusion, although Hermeticism and Zen Buddhism may at first appear unrelated, a deeper examination of their teachings reveals shared ideas of interconnectedness, self-discovery, and self-realization. Combining these principles into both personal and initiatory practices can lead to an enriched spiritual path that draws upon the unique wisdom and insights found in each tradition. By exploring and integrating these philosophies, individuals may benefit from a more profound understanding of their spiritual journey, themselves, and the world around them.
