In the shadowy vaults of yon North Western Halls,
Where stern Demiurge mysterious wisdom calls,
A cloistered sanctum strewn with tomes arcane
Scrawled with the ink of old Pharaohs, who disdain
To share their gift, their knowledge esoteric,
Sacred and accursed, a strange paradox cryptic.

Upon these walls etched sigils of renown,
That once held transmutation's art, the crown
Of Persian Ahriman, the secret of the stars,
Parchmented whispers of Mercurial avatars.

As frayed scrolls unravel, fragments they unveil
Alchemical dreams, through ashen smoke they sail.
Lacunae of knowledge, a parable obscure,
Forbidden fruits coveted by sages demure.

Here lurk the clowders by lantern's amber glow,
Prowling feline guardians of the secrets below.
Their emerald eyes, cast in spellbound intent,
Pierce through the veil, where lesser minds have bent.

Within this maze, a hallowed chamber lies
A seeker treads, to claim the hidden prize.
Yet there, the Gnostic verses stand before,
A buried truth, a door inside a door.

As serpentine visions coil the heart aflame,
The fervid seeker and secret become the same.
Talismans that shackle, and glyphs that empower,
A spectral dance, a journey devoured.

So let me weave, O potent Chimaera,
The tale of the seeker, wisdom-wooer.
The gnosis entwined in the shadow of desire,
In the winding halls where arcane whispers conspire.

When the moon is drained of her argent grace,
And weary stars the void's embrace.
In the twilight hour's somber sigh,
We traverse the corridors and listen for the lie:

The unspoken riddle wrapped in enigma's shroud,
On the edge of a myth, where light is disallowed.
From ancient catacombs to the cryptic shelves,
In the depths of the North Western Library dwells.
