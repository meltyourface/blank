Nihilism, as a philosophical concept, gained substantial influence in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is characterized by the belief in the ultimate meaninglessness and purposelessness of life, accompanied by the rejection of moral, religious, and social authority. Inevitably, this pervasive philosophy left its mark on literature, shaping the works and ideas of several prominent figures from various movements.

One of the earliest and most critical examinations of Nihilism is that of Ivan Turgenev in his novel "Fathers and Sons" (1862). The character Bazarov, a self-proclaimed Nihilist, challenges the established values, ideas, and norms. Turgenev's novel profoundly impacted Russian literature, providing an artistic platform for the exploration of Nihilistic thought, which would later inspire other Russian authors, such as Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, to delve into its complexities.

In the 20th century, Nihilism's influence on literature manifested through different movements and themes. The Lost Generation, a group of post-World War I writers, including Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, regularly dealt with themes of disillusionment and existential ennui, exploring feelings of meaninglessness and despair inspired by a Nihilistic worldview.

Similarly, the works of Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, credited with the development and expansion of Existentialism, were significantly shaped by Nihilism. Their novels, "The Stranger" and "Nausea," respectively, exhibit elements of existential angst and radical skepticism, as well as exploring the human condition within a Nihilistic framework.

In contemporary literature, the pervasive themes of Nihilism echo the present-day world's sense of uncertainty and unease. Bret Easton Ellis's "American Psycho" and Chuck Palahniuk's "Fight Club" reflect the disconnection, pessimism, and disillusionment inherent in a Nihilistic perspective.

Comparatively, Nihilism's interpretation has evolved across cultural and historical contexts. While early Russian Nihilism often focused on social critiques and political rebellion, later existential interpretations often centered on the individual's struggle to find purpose and meaning in a world devoid of inherent values.

The potential implications and enduring importance of Nihilism within the literary landscape lie in its role as a mirror, reflecting humanity's darker aspects, its deepest fears, and the paradoxes of existence. The characters and narratives emerging from Nihilistic literature provide insight into the human struggle to reconcile the desire for meaning with the notion of an inherently meaningless world.

Furthermore, Nihilistic themes also challenge readers and writers alike to confront their own beliefs, values, and assumptions about life. While exposing the fragility of society's structures and paradigms, Nihilism serves as a catalyst for imagination and critical inquiry, opening avenues for the exploration of alternate narratives, ethics, and possibilities.

In conclusion, Nihilism has significantly contributed to the shaping of literary themes, movements, and authors throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and its influence continues to pervade contemporary literature. Its ever-evolving interpretations and manifestations have enriched the literary landscape and will likely continue to do so, reflecting humanity's profound quest for meaning and understanding in a world that often seems devoid of purpose.
