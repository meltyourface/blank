1. **Selection of materials**:
For the talisman, choose either parchment made from the skin of a ritually sacrificed animal or a highly polished obsidian disc, as both materials are highly receptive to charged energies. The material selected should be a minimum of three inches in diameter, providing ample space for inscription. Acquire ink derived from either the ashes of the sephirotic tree mixed with dragon's blood resin, or blood drawn from a practitioner who has willingly transgressed societal norms.

2. **Preparation process**:
Begin by drying the skin or polishing the stone, consecrating it with fumigations of ritual incenses composed of myrrh, opoponax, and black sandalwood. Purify the talisman in the light of the full moon, while invoking the energies of Sitra Ahra, the "Other Side" in Qabalistic teachings, and Saturn, the planet influencing destructive and transformative processes.

3. **Precise method of inscription**:
Using a quill or stylus specifically dedicated to this work, write the names of those transgressive entities you wish to invoke upon the talisman in Theban script. Lilith, Samael, Asmodeus, and Belial are particularly potent choices. Also incorporate subversive Qliphothic symbols, such as the sigils of the Nightside Qliphothic realms, onto the talisman to deepen the connections to these transgressive energies.

4. **Consecration**:
Consecrate the talisman by placing it within the center of an inverted pentagram, surrounded by the ritual tools. Ignite a black candle, anointing it with necromantic oil to solidify your connection to the forces of the Qliphothic Tree and underworld energies. Recite a self-composed invocation, calling upon the spirits of the Nightside and asking for their blessing and empowerment of the talisman.

5. **Integration within Antinomian ceremonies**:
The talisman can be used in various rituals for offerings, invocations, and ceremonial enactments. Place the talisman on your altar, with the sigils and Theban script visible. Ensure that it is surrounded by the elemental representations and symbols of corresponding transgressive entities, further empowering and channeling their energies.

**Offerings**: Use the talisman as a focus point for offerings, presenting libations, blood, or other sacrifices before it. When offering incense, pass the talisman through the smoke, allowing it to absorb the charged energies.

**Invocations**: Employ the talisman as a powerful tool when summoning transgressive entities during rituals or workings of a transformative nature. Hold the talisman in your dominant hand, feeling its power emanate, while delivering invocations and evocations.

Ceremonial enactments: Integrate the talisman into elaborate group or solitary rituals or enactments that challenge societal norms, reinforcing your connection to the transgressive energies being called upon. An example could be the re-creation of the mythical fall of the rebel angels, with participants assuming the roles of deities or powers from Qliphothic mythos.

Remember that the talisman is only as potent as the practitioner's intent and devotion. Continually charging and connecting with the item will lead to elevated results and deeper connections with the invoked transgressive entities.
