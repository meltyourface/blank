The correct answer is:

The deliberate inversion of traditional symbols and rituals

The deliberate inversion of traditional symbols and rituals is most profoundly connected to the core principles of self-discovery, personal transformation, and challenging societal norms in the context of Antinomian ritual. This aspect also simultaneously relates to broader occult concepts and practices.

Antinomianism, originating from the Greek words "anti" (against) and "nomos" (law), is a belief system that opposes societal norms, rules, and morality. It encourages individuals to question established systems of power and redefine their understanding of right and wrong. In various esoteric and occult practices, Antinomianism is often associated with the LHP (Left-Hand Path) traditions, which seek self-discovery and personal transformation through unorthodox or transgressive means.

Inverting traditional symbols and rituals is an essential concept in Antinomianism, as it directly challenges established authority and orthodox religious structures. By deliberately invoking and subverting these symbols, Antinomian practitioners undermine traditional beliefs and dogmas, prompting both themselves and society to question the validity of the status quo. This process fuels self-discovery while fostering individual growth and transformation.

The inversion of symbols and rituals is a well-established practice within the occult, particularly in movements such as Satanism, which often employs the sigil of Baphomet or the inverted pentagram to symbolize the inversion of divine authority or the reconciliation of opposites. In addition, chaos magic, which is associated with the Left-Hand Path, often focuses on the deliberate manipulation or deconstruction of symbols and rituals to alter outcomes in accordance with the practitioner's will.

In comparison to the other options:

1. The use of numerology and astrological systems for self-analysis can be valuable tools for self-discovery, but they are not inherently Antinomian, nor do they directly challenge societal norms or connect with broader occult concepts in the same way as inversion does.
   
2. The invocation of deities and spirits aligned with chaos and liberation can be a powerful Antinomian practice, especially when those entities are inherently linked to challenging authority. However, this option falls short in that it does not encompass the full scope of Antinomianism's connections to self-discovery and transformation through the deliberate subversion of symbols and rituals.
   
3. The integration of artistic expression and symbolism in self-initiation rites can be instrumental in personal growth and transformation but does not inherently challenge societal norms or engage with a broader range of occult practices in the same way as the deliberate inversion of traditional symbols and rituals.

In conclusion, the deliberate inversion of traditional symbols and rituals is quintessential to Antinomian ritual as it connects to the core principles of self-discovery, personal transformation, and challenging societal norms. Furthermore, its connection to broader occult practices makes it the most fitting answer among the choices provided.
