Enchantment Name: Tabula Dimidium

Purpose: To enable Familiars to seamlessly and inconspicuously adjust their size while concealing their magical signatures from other magical beings.

Materials Required:

1. Crystalline magnesite - serves as the base for inscription
2. Eonelyn's ink - to transcribe the enchantment
3. Solaticis essence - an ancient spirit-summoning catalyst
4. White moonfern - as an ethereal reagent that stabilizes the transformation
5. Voidstone dust - a rare, magical signature suppressor
6. Quill of a phoenix feather - to properly channel the magic

Astrological Timing: The enchantment must be performed during the zenith of the moon's waning crescent phase, representing transitions and diminished visibility.

Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. Prepare the workspace by drawing a circle with voidstone dust. The magic circle should be of sufficient size to accommodate the familiar during the enchantment process.

2. Add the white moonfern petals to a mortar and pestle, then sprinkle in a pinch of voidstone dust. Grind the mixture gently until it forms a smooth, shimmery powder.

3. Place the crystalline magnesite at the center of the magic circle. Lightly dust the magnesite with the moonfern-voidstone blend, allowing the ethereal energy of the moonfern to integrate into its structure.

4. Use the phoenix feather quill and Eonelyn's ink to inscribe a sigil sequence on the magnesite, carefully detailing the size transformation range as well as its adjustable parameters.

5. Chant the following invocation thrice, summoning the ancient spirits for assistance:

"Olde spirits, heed our call,
Obscure our form, both great and small,
Through void and veil, unseen we slip,
Tabula Dimidium, now tightly grip."

6. Gently place three drops of Solaticis essence on the sigil sequence, bestowing the blessing of the ancient spirits.

7. With the Familiar within the circle, activate the enchantment by chanting:

"Tabula Dimidium, solvite scinderique,
Blend thy essence with those unseen,
Through the moon's waning eye, grant thy power,
Size's mystery, to us now shower."

8. The Familiar should proceed to touch or enter into close contact with the magnesite, allowing the enchantment to transfer and become one with its magical essence.

Upon successful completion, the Familiar will have gained the ability to seamlessly and inconspicuously adjust its size while minimizing its magical signature. This enchantment is a powerful yet time-limited tool, requiring reapplication as the zenith of each waning crescent moon transpires.
