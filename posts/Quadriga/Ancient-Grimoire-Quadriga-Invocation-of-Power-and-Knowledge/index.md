  I invoke the Arcane Quadriga, the fourfold mystery of power and knowledge, in the ancient tongue of grimoires and sacred texts:
  
  Axíos Ti-alad Lomthanor - The Axiomancy decree, unfathomed laws entwined,
  Chresmesi In'shrelle Ophentis - Chresmomancy, the voice divine,
  Eido Ath-sulmi Vor'drakhorn - Within Eidonomy, essence confined,
  Hiero-craln-túm Lophnágor - Hieromancy sanctified.
  
  From the depths of cosmic knowledge, I call forth the four pillars of the Quadriga:
  
  Êstros Manceres - The elemental wave, Axiomancy's foundation laid,
  Skrythos Mantikore - Visions true, Chresmomancy's illumination made,
  Anamórphos Eikono - Eidonomy's shifting form, souls displayed,
  Arctur'n Mathonos - Hieromancy's sacred dance, transcendence weighed.
  
  Unveil the symbols, the language arcane,
  Four sigils inscribed, the mysteries ingrained:
  
  Axiomance - Pent'alma Strandix, 'round the circle unbroken,
  Chresmomance - Ompho-chrus Tychon, the oracle's voice spoken,
  Eidonoryt - Méta-crya Phanes, through fractals ever-changing,
  Hierómantia - Oro-templar Hieron, the sanctum rearranging.
  
  Let the darkened whispers call,
  Arcane secrets from ancient thrall:
  
  Weave the forces, connect the strands,
  Boundless energies, obey my commands,
  Hear my voice as I recite,
  The Quadriga incantation, elder might.
  
  By the Quadriga's ancient power combined,
  Unlock the mysteries, through space and time,
  Guide my hand and cast the runes,
  Walk the cryptic path thy masters strewn,
  Conjure the power, invoke the rhyme,
  Reveal the truth, eternities unwind.
