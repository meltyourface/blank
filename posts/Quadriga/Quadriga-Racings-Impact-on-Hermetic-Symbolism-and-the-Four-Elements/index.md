The adoption of four horses symbolizing four elements in Hermetic philosophy.

The connection between ancient quadriga racing and its influence on occult and esoteric concepts can be seen through the adoption of four horses symbolizing the four elements in Hermetic philosophy. To understand this connection, we first need to delve into the concepts of quadriga racing, Hermetic philosophy, and the four elements.

Quadriga racing was an ancient chariot racing event in which a chariot was drawn by four horses abreast. This form of racing was popular in ancient Greece, Rome, and the Byzantine Empire. The quadriga was not just a sport but also had significant cultural and religious significance, as the chariot itself was an artistic symbol of divine accomplishment and victory.

Hermetic philosophy, on the other hand, is an esoteric tradition based on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure in ancient Greece and Egypt. It is a spiritual path that seeks to understand the mysteries of the universe and the nature of reality. The teachings of Hermeticism have permeated many aspects of occult and esoteric traditions throughout history, including alchemy, astrology, and magic.

**A fundamental concept in Hermeticism is the idea of the four elements**: fire, water, air, and earth. These elements are believed to represent aspects of reality and are connected to every aspect of life, both tangible and intangible. The four elements are used in various esoteric practices, such as alchemy and the construction of magical circles, and serve as the foundation of understanding the forces that shape our world.

The connection between quadriga racing and Hermetic philosophy is in the number of horses used and their symbolic significance. The four horses in the quadriga can be seen as representing the four elements, and by extension, the forces that govern existence. This association gives the quadriga a deeper, esoteric meaning, highlighting the belief in the interplay between the physical world and the spiritual realm.

In Hermeticism, the quadriga's four horses mirror the importance placed on the balance and interaction of the four elements. This symbolism can be seen as an allegory for the human journey through life, with the charioteer seeking to achieve harmony and mastery over the elements. In this way, the quadriga becomes a symbol of spiritual attainment and the goal of understanding the mysteries of existence.

In conclusion, the adoption of four horses symbolizing the four elements in Hermetic philosophy demonstrates the influence of ancient quadriga racing on occult and esoteric concepts. By associating the four horses of the quadriga with the fundamental elements of existence, this racing tradition took on a deeper significance and served as an inspiration for esoteric thought and practice.
