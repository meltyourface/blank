Ah, my dear brethren, did you not expect the sun to rise and illuminate the dark recesses of your betrayal? For indeed, I am akin to the basilisk that perceives through the veil of shadows and into the heart of treachery. You have broken the final seal, consorting with the insidious Moonchild—for she who has turned the tides and vanquished the astral bonds that held our inviolate conclave together.

Lo and ye, your transgressions are etched through sacred glyphs, a myriad of sulphur, salt, and mercury coruscating through the esoteric tapestry that binds us all. Yet, I must consider the celestial parchment was fraught with heresy from some insipid soul. In the garb of an ally, a lodestone fixing the course of our shared destiny, you, my dear associate, chose falsity over the sanctity of our ancient tenets.

Like the ibis, I have picked apart the murky depths of deception, filter through the muck of malevolent machination, and revealed the truth shining in the radiant Milky Way. And thus, I must retaliate with methods that eclipse the sacred hexagrams – a devious plan that whispers through the fractals of time and tempest.

Did you not imagine, that I, the venerable adept, would divine the web you wove so contemptibly? You sought to siphon our power, wicked one – but let me remind you of the omnipotent Eye of the Ouroboros that binds and looses with infinitesimal whirls. From the expanse of the vast void, constellations shall warp and bend until they are aligned in harmonious reverence for the Celestial Master.

Within the crucible of Typhon, tinctured of our collected perversity, you shall lay, quivering in the assemblage of your treacherous deeds given form. The chthonic whispers of cryptic incantations shall assail you as I draw upon the elemental forces that course through the secret doctrine, traversing the astral planes to exact my retribution.

Aeons shall pass, and your serpent's spirit shall not find solace; for I, the wielder of the Tetragrammaton and alchemist of the sevenfold furnace, shall forge a prism of torment, a Lemniscate without respite. Your penitential anguish shall become as formless as the quintessence, swirling counterclockwise through the unyielding Wheel of Fortune as my vengeance reigns. Like the falcon navigating the spheres, I shall plunge my talons of fate into your corrupted essence.

Pity no longer dwells within the confines of my exalted heart. For you have spurned paradise, and the gates have clanged shut behind thee, sealing your doom. And I, the Marquis of Arcana, shall rejoice in the re-establishment of balance, as equilibrium is restored through the methods of our forebears. The cosmic scales have decreed your fate, and now you too shall face the final alchemical inferno.
