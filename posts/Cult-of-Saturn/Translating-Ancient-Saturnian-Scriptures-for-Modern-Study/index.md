To perform this task, I will utilize my extensive knowledge of the Cult of Saturn and its esoteric practices, as well as my deep understanding of ancient languages and cryptography techniques. 
**Step 1**: Analyze the ancient Saturnian scriptures
- Firstly, identify the language and writing system used in the scripture. The Cult of Saturn has predominantly used a variation of the ancient Proto-Sinaitic script and Saturnian symbols mixed with occult codes.
- Investigate the text for any patterns or repetition that might indicate a specific encryption method employed by the Cult. 
**Step 2**: Decoding the original text
- Using cryptography techniques like frequency analysis, substitution ciphers, and the knowledge of Saturnian symbols' meanings, decode the ancient scripture.
- Apply the knowledge of the Cult's mystical practices to interpret any complex references to rituals, deities, or metaphysical concepts.
**Step 3**: Translating the decoded text into contemporary languages
- Choose an appropriate contemporary language for translation, such as English or Spanish.
- Preserve the integrity of the original text by ensuring that idiomatic expressions, metaphors, and symbolic terminology are accurately conveyed in the target language.
- Consult other ancient texts and research materials on the Cult of Saturn to further enrich the translation and ensure the accuracy of encoded information.
**Step 4**: Verification and editing of the translated text
- Double-check the translation against the original text to ensure authenticity and make any required corrections.
- Fine-tune the translation to ensure readability and clarity while maintaining the mystique and profundity of the ancient Saturnian scripture.
**Step 5**: Compilation of translated scriptures
- Organize and compile the translated scriptures into a cohesive, well-structured document that can be easily accessed and studied by practitioners of the Cult of Saturn and those interested in the esoteric knowledge it reveals.

Through the completion of these steps, the ancient Saturnian scriptures will be translated effectively into contemporary languages, ensuring that the original doctrines and mystical practices of the occult Cult of Saturn are preserved and made accessible to modern seekers. The deep understanding and expertise in the esoteric realm will guarantee the highest level of accuracy and quality in the translation.
