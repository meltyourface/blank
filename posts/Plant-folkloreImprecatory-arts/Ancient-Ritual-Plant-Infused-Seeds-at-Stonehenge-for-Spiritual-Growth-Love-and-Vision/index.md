1. Plant Selection and Mystical Properties

The three distinct plants selected for this ceremony are:

a. Sage (Salvia officinalis) - Sage is a powerful plant used for cleansing, purifying, and protection. Its positive energies include wisdom, healing, and spiritual growth.

b. Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) - Hawthorn is a plant renowned for its enchanting and magical properties. It brings positive energies of love, happiness, and emotional well-being.

c. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - Mugwort is a revered visionary herb that opens the doors to the otherworldly realms. Its positive energies include psychic abilities, lucid dreaming, and astral projection.

2. Location

The historically significant location for the ritual is Stonehenge, England. This ancient stone circle is a sacred space known for its alignment with celestial events and its potential for amplifying spiritual energies.

3. Incantations, Gestures, and Offerings

a. Sage - The practitioner is to hold a bundle of dried sage, light it gently, and speak the incantation: "Eternal wisdom, healing light, protect and cleanse with your sacred might." Pass the burning sage bundle over the seeds while making clockwise circles in the air with the intention of infusing them with the sage's energies. Offer the remaining ashes to the earth as a symbol of gratitude and renewal.

b. Hawthorn - Create a Hawthorn flower essence by soaking its flowers in spring water under direct sunlight. Whisper the incantation, "Heart's delight, love's pure bloom, happiness within these seeds consume." Sprinkle the flower essence over the seeds to imbue them with the plant's energies. Leave a small offering of honey as a gesture of appreciation to the spirits of the Hawthorn.

c. Mugwort - Using a Mugwort-infused oil, anoint the seeds with the shape of a crescent moon while reciting the incantation, "Dreamer's herb of vision bright, infuse these seeds with astral light." Offer a lock of the practitioner's hair to the spirits of the Mugwort as a gesture of personal connection and reciprocity.

4. Elemental Arrangement

Create a sacred space in the center of Stonehenge by arranging the following symbolic items:

- Sage: Place pieces of clear quartz crystal in a circle to represent clarity and spiritual growth.
- Hawthorn: Arrange heart-shaped rose quartz stones to symbolize love and emotional well-being.
- Mugwort: Position labradorite stones in a crescent moon formation to represent psychic abilities, intuition, and spiritual connection.

Additionally, light a white candle in the center of the arrangement to represent the divine presence and invocation of the respective plant spirits.

5. Lunar Phase and Celestial Positioning

For the highest potency and effectiveness, perform this ritual on the night of a full moon when the celestial bodies are in alignment: Sage (Moon in Scorpio), Hawthorn (Moon in Taurus), and Mugwort (Moon in Pisces).

6. Purification Process

Before the ceremony, the practitioner must undergo a purification process to cleanse themselves of negative energies. This involves a ritual bath infused with herbs corresponding to each of the chosen plants: sage leaves, hawthorn flowers, and mugwort stems. While bathing, meditate on purging negative energies and attuning oneself to the plants' respective energies. Post-bath, anoint oneself with sage, hawthorn, and mugwort essential oils in the shape of a pentacle on the forehead to symbolize spiritual alignment and readiness.
