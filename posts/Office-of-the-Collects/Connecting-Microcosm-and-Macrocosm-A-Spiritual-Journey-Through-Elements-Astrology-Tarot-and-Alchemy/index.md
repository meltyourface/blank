To fully respond to this challenge, we will first go through the basics of the Four Elements, Astrology, Tarot, and Alchemy individually, and identify their symbolic representations. Then, we will collate these findings and analyze their connections to provide a cohesive understanding of the interconnectedness of the macrocosm and microcosm in the process of spiritual growth and transformation.

1. **The Four Elements - Earth, Air, Fire, and Water**:
In various esoteric traditions, the four classical elements are considered the basic building blocks of life. Earth represents solid matter, practicality, stability, and groundedness. Air represents intelligence, communication, and mental processes. Fire signifies willpower, passion, and transformation. Water symbolizes emotion, intuition, and adaptability. In the context of spiritual growth, mastering the balance between these elements within oneself can lead to personal transformation and a deeper connection to the universe.

2. **Astrology**:
Astrology is the study of the movements and positions of celestial bodies, and their perceived influence on human affairs and the natural world. The twelve zodiac signs, associated with the elements and modalities, represent different energies and characteristics that people are said to be born with. These signs, along with the planets and their positions at the time of birth, shape an individual's natal astrology chart, conveying potential strengths, weaknesses, and life lessons. Astrology can provide a greater understanding of oneself and the patterns that inform our experience, aligning the individual (microcosm) with the celestial patterns (macrocosm).

3. **Tarot**:
Tarot, a deck of 78 cards, consists of the Major and Minor Arcana. The 22 Major Arcana cards symbolize significant archetypal energies and stages of personal development, while the 56 Minor Arcana deal with more detailed aspects of daily life. Tarot can be used for divination to unlock the hidden aspects of the unconscious mind, as well as for spiritual guidance and reflection. It can facilitate deeper contemplation on the interplay of individual choices and spiritual wisdom, as well as the intersection of both paths, enabling both personal growth and a greater understanding of our place in the cosmos.

4. **Alchemy**:
Alchemy can be thought of as both an early proto-scientific and philosophical practice, with the ultimate aim being the transmutation of base metals into gold and the discovery of the elixir of life. However, at a deeper esoteric level, it represents the spiritual transformation from a state of ignorance to enlightenment, akin to the process of converting base metals into gold. The internal alchemical process encompasses seven stages of personal transformation that ultimately lead to the integration of the true self with the divine or the universe.

Having analyzed the symbolic representations present in all four components - The Four Elements, Astrology, Tarot, and Alchemy - we can now synthesize them to gain a deeper understanding of how they unveil the interconnectedness of the macrocosm and microcosm in the process of spiritual growth and transformation.

The Four Elements give us a basic understanding of the forces that constitute the natural world, as well as a framework for exploring our internal psychological makeup. Astrology further explores these concepts by connecting the patterns of the celestial bodies to individual experiences, revealing connections within the universe. Tarot acts as a tool to examine our subconscious selves and our place in the surrounding world, and the internal processes that shape our experiences. Alchemy represents the ultimate spiritual goal comprising both science and philosophy, guiding individuals through the process of self-improvement, growth, and oneness with the greater cosmos.

In conclusion, The Four Elements, Astrology, Tarot, and Alchemy share a common theme of understanding the connection between the microcosm (individual) and the macrocosm (universe) within the framework of spiritual growth and transformation. By deeply engaging with these systems, individuals can gain a broader perspective on the patterns, relationships, and symbols that underlie their own lives and the broader cosmos, ultimately achieving personal growth, understanding, and interconnectedness with the greater universe.
