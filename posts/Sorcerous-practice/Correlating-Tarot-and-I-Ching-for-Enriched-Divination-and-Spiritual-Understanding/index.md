excerpt: >

  1. Determine a foundation for connecting these two ancient divination practices. Consider exploring common themes, elemental associations, or numerological patterns.

  2. Focus on the Major Arcana, comprising 22 cards, and identify the essential characteristics and symbolic meanings of each card, such as their elemental and astrological correspondences, archetypal representations, or underlying esoteric principles.

  3. Delve into the I Ching, delimiting each of the 64 hexagrams with their corresponding trigrams, lines, and meanings. Contemplate how the hexagrams exhibit particular energies, polarity, and wisdom in line with traditional Chinese cosmology and philosophy.

  4. Initiate the synthesis of Tarot and I Ching systems by drawing parallels between the cards and hexagrams. For instance, examine similarities in symbolic language and imbue significance of duality or balance found in both practices.

  5. Enrich the correspondences by considering factors such as spiritual development, mystical journey, or archetypal transformations. Expound upon the intrinsic and mystical relationships between both systems to create a tapestry of arcane wisdom.

  6. Devise a practical and methodical way to assign hexagrams to each Major Arcana card, accounting for any gaps or overlaps due to the difference in numbers. Consider generating a chart or visual representation to synthesize and convey these connections aptly.

  7. Test the devised system's accuracy by performing sample readings or divination rituals using the Tarot and I Ching correspondences. Adjust or refine the system, as needed, based on insights gained through this experiential process.

1. Foundation for connecting Tarot and I Ching:
To aid in the correlation between the Tarot's Major Arcana and the I Ching hexagrams, the foundation I have determined is rooted in the principles of their numerology and theme of human archetypes, which aligns with both systems' modes of understanding the human experience and the cosmos.

2. Major Arcana's essential characteristics and symbolic meanings: 

The essential characteristics of Tarot's Major Arcana cards were delineated according to their elemental correspondences, astrological attributions, Kabbalistic associations, and symbolic representations of human archetypes from The Fool to The World.

3. I Ching's hexagrams, trigrams, lines, and meanings:

The 64 I Ching hexagrams were studied, along with their corresponding trigrams and the yin-yang dynamic of the lines. The traditional texts and interpretations were explored, focusing on key elements such as elemental associations, stages of transformation, and the concepts of Tao, Te, and Yi in Chinese cosmology.

4. Synthesis of Tarot and I Ching systems:

Parallels were drawn between the symbols and archetypes manifested in both the Major Arcana cards and I Ching hexagrams. A focus on universal themes, such as duality, the human journey through spiritual development, and cosmic balance, was emphasized, weaving connections between the two modalities.

5. Enriching the correspondences:

The correlations were further enriched by diving into the mystical journey, spiritual development, and transformation within the symbology of the Tarot and I Ching. The interrelation of these two systems manifested a unified, broader understanding of the esoteric wisdom they both convey.

6. Creating a practical and methodical way to assign hexagrams to Major Arcana cards:

A chart was developed where each of the 22 Major Arcana cards was assigned a set of I Ching hexagrams, taking into account their numerological connections, elemental attributes, and shared themes. The chart was designed to accommodate the difference in numbers, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their relationship.

7. Testing and refining the devised system:

Tarot readings and I Ching divinations were performed using the established correspondences, evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the synthesized system. Any necessary adjustments to the correlations were made based on insights gleaned from the divination practice.

8. Sharing the completed system and gathering feedback:

The completed system of correspondences was shared with fellow practitioners in the esoteric community, inviting discussion and feedback. Potential refinements and enhancements were evaluated, leading to a deeper understanding and more effective utilization of both the Tarot and I Ching in divination and personal growth.
