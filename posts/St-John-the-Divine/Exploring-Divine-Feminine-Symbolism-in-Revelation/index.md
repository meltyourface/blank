In the Book of Revelation, St. John the Divine, through a series of vivid and enigmatic visions, unveils the prophetic narrative of the culmination of human history and the eventual triumph of good over evil. Central to this esoteric and occult work are the representations of the divine feminine, most notably the figures of the Woman Clothed with the Sun and the Whore of Babylon. In order to analyze and evaluate their portrayal and significance, we must delve into their symbolism, dualities, and roles within the apocalyptic allegory.

The Woman Clothed with the Sun is introduced in Revelation 12 and is described as being adorned with celestial symbols, including a crown of stars and the sun clothing her body, while standing upon the moon. In the course of the narrative, she gives birth to a male child, who is destined to rule all nations. This imagery evokes the celestial archetype of the divine feminine, as well as symbolic associations with the Virgin Mary and the Christ-child.

In the esoteric and occult teachings, the Woman Clothed with the Sun represents the positive aspects of the divine feminine, most significantly the qualities of nurturing, compassion, and spiritual enlightenment. Her celestial adornments hint at the cosmic nature of this divine principle, which transcends the mundanity of earthly existence. In a broader context, the Woman exemplifies spiritual perfection and the manifestation of divine grace in the material realm – an embodiment of the sacred union of the divine feminine and the divine masculine, paralleling the alchemical concept of the "coniunctio."

The Whore of Babylon, on the other hand, is introduced in Revelation 17 as a figure of decadence, fornication, and worldliness, seemingly a direct antithesis of the Woman Clothed with the Sun. Sitting astride a seven-headed beast, she is the personification of all that corrupts, attracts, and ultimately destroys. She is the proverbial temptress, a feminine symbol of earthly power and materialism in its most degraded form. Her association with the city of Babylon underscores her role in the spread of corruption, idolatry, and false teachings.

In esoteric teachings, the Whore of Babylon represents the darker, more seductive side of the divine feminine, a duality that mirrors the two-fold nature of existence – the sacred and the profane. Moreover, she embodies the temptation and distractions that divert the spiritual seeker from the path of transformation, contrary to the guiding force of the Woman Clothed with the Sun.

Both figures significantly impact the overall narrative structure and interpretation of the Book of Revelation. The presence of these two caricatures allows the reader to contemplate the complexities of the divine feminine and the nature of duality within spiritual and material realms. Additionally, these characters serve as symbolic reminders of the human struggle to seek spiritual purity amidst the myriad of distractions and temptations that pervade the earthly domain.

Ultimately, St. John the Divine employs the images of the Woman Clothed with the Sun and the Whore of Babylon to illustrate the stark opposition between the forces of light and darkness, sacredness and profanity, and the spiritual and the material. Through the lens of esoteric and occult interpretation, these contrasting symbols remind the seeker that our journey towards spiritual attainment encompasses the comprehension and recognition of both the dark and the light aspects of the divine feminine, as well as the inner battle to embody the highest expression of human potential.
