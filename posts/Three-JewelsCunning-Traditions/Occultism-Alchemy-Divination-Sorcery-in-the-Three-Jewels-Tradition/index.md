Origins of the Three JewelsCunning Traditions

The roots of the Three JewelsCunning Traditions can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. **Each of these civilizations contributed different aspects of the occult to form the basis of the modern tradition**:

1. **Alchemy**: With its origins in Egypt, alchemy is concerned with the transformation of base materials into gold, as well as the attainment of the Philosopher's Stone, which is said to grant eternal life and enlightenment. This practice eventually spread to the Islamic world and Europe, evolving into a spiritual discipline focused on inner transformation.
2. **Divination**: Arising from Mesopotamia, divination has been practiced since ancient times as a means of foretelling the future and gaining insights into the hidden aspects of life. Divination methods within the Three JewelsCunning Traditions include various forms of scrying, cartomancy, and astrological study.
3. **Sorcery**: With origins in the shamanic traditions of various cultures, sorcery involves the manipulation of energies through specific rituals, spells, and invocations. The Greek goetic tradition, for instance, was focused on invoking spirits to affect change in the world, whereas African and Native American magic called upon the forces of nature and ancestral spirits for power and guidance.

2. **The Law of Correspondences**: This belief posits that there exist meaningful relationships between different aspects of reality, making it possible to affect one through the other.
