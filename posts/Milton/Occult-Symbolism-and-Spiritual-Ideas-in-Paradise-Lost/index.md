John Milton: Occult Influences and Esoteric Symbolism in "Paradise Lost"

Introduction to John Milton's Occult Connections

John Milton, the 17th-century English poet, and polemicist, is best known for his epic poem "Paradise Lost," which chronicles the biblical story of the Fall of Man. While Milton's writings have been widely celebrated for their literary and political significance, less explored is the profound influence of the occult, esoteric symbolism, and ideas present within his works. By examining the hermetic traditions, alchemical concepts, and Christian mysticism that informed his worldview, it becomes clear that these aspects are not mere coincidences but integral to understanding the deeper meanings within Milton's literary creations.

Reflection of Hermetic Traditions

The hermetic tradition is a key spiritual and philosophical current present in "Paradise Lost," which is primarily derived from the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary sage in ancient Egypt. The hermetic philosophy subscribes to the idea of the interconnectedness of the universe and the notion of "as above, so below" â€“ the belief that what happens on a grand cosmic scale is reflected in the microcosm of human experience.

Milton was heavily influenced by this tradition, and it is apparent throughout his depictions of the celestial hierarchy, divine order, and the relationships between angels, demons, and human beings in "Paradise Lost." For instance, the celestial hierarchy in the poem consists of nine orders of beings, mirroring the Neoplatonic view of the Cosmos, which comprises nine celestial spheres. Furthermore, Milton's emphasis on the importance of divine order and obedience to it, as well as the repercussions of deviating from the hierarchical structure, echoes the hermetic principle of correspondence.

Alchemical Concepts in "Paradise Lost"

Throughout "Paradise Lost," Milton weaves in alchemical ideas, which serve as both metaphors and deeper mystical teachings for the discerning reader. One prominent alchemical concept in the poem is the process of purification and transformation of the soul. The characters of Adam and Eve can be seen as allegorical representations of base matter, which, through the experience of the fall and their subsequent redemption, undergo a spiritual transformation akin to the alchemical process of turning lead into gold.

Similarly, the character of Satan embodies the alchemical notion of the nigredo, or blackening stage, of spiritual transformation, signifying the initial stage of descent into darkness and chaos. Ultimately, the cosmic drama that unfolds in "Paradise Lost" can be viewed as an alchemical process in which the characters' inner transformations occur alongside the cosmic events, leading to eventual spiritual redemption and enlightenment.

Christian Mysticism in Milton's Work

Milton's "Paradise Lost" also draws heavily from the tradition of Christian mysticism, a spiritual practice characterized by direct and profound experiences of the divine. Throughout the poem, Milton emphasizes the importance of introspective spiritual contemplation in understanding the divine mysteries of existence.

For example, the poem begins with an invocation to the "Heav'nly Muse," a request for divine inspiration that resonates with the tradition of prayer and meditation in Christian mysticism. Moreover, the concept of the divine indwelling of the Holy Spirit within humanity is at the core of the character's spiritual journey in "Paradise Lost." The portrayal of this profound mystical connection with the divine serves as a vital element for understanding Milton's vision of the universe and human potential.

Conclusion: Gaining Deep Insights through Occult Connections

By exploring the occult influences, esoteric symbolism, and spiritual ideas weaving through John Milton's "Paradise Lost," a student or initiate seeking to gain deep insights can unveil a rich and multi-layered tapestry of meaning within the poem. Recognizing and understanding the hermetic traditions, alchemical concepts, and Christian mysticism present in Milton's work can provide a deeper appreciation of the poem's messages and encourage a more profound engagement with the spiritual dimensions of the text.
