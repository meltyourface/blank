To exhibit my mastery of Milton's "Paradise Lost" in transmuting selected passages into modern English, while retaining esoteric allusions and occult symbolism, I have chosen the passage from Book 2, lines 204-214:

Original Miltonian Text:
```
Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,
Satan with thoughts inflamed of Highest design,
Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell
Explores his solitary flight: sometimes
He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left,
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soars
Up to the fiery concave towering high.
As when far off at sea a fleet descried
Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds
Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring
```

Modern English Translation:
```
In the meantime, God and Man's adversary,
Satan, burning with thoughts of the grandest plans,
Dons swift wings, and toward Hell's gates,
Embarks on a lonely flight in exploration: at times,
He sweeps along the right coast, at other times the left,
Now skimming with outstretched wings the abyss, then soaring
Up to the fiery vault towering so high.
As when at great distances on the ocean, a fleet sighted,
Hovers in the clouds, propelled by equinoctial currents
Sailing tight from Bengal, or from the islands
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants travel with goods.
```

Comparative Analysis and Implications on Modern Interpretations:

In the original text, Milton refers to the character of Satan as the "Adversary of God and Man." The modern translation renders it as "God and Man's adversary," emphasizing his role as the antagonist in both divine and human realms. This subtle shift highlights the duality of Satan as not just a figure in religious mythology but also a symbol of the darker aspects of human nature.

The phrase "thoughts inflamed of Highest design" in the original text is translated into "burning with thoughts of the grandest plans." This transformation conveys the ambition and passion hidden in Satan's intentions, while still preserving his cunning and manipulative nature.

When describing Satan's flight, the original text employs phrases such as "He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left" and "Now shaves with level wing the deep." In the modern translation, these phrases are adapted to contemporary language: "He sweeps along the right coast, at other times the left" and "Now skimming with outstretched wings the abyss." This alteration maintains the imagery of Satan's flight while making it more accessible to a modern reader.

In the original text, Milton alludes to the faraway places of "Bengala, or the isles / Of Ternate and Tidore." The modern translation retains these geographic references, which might intrigue contemporary readers who recognize them as present-day Bengal (in India) and the Moluccas (in Indonesia). These exotic and distant locations add to the mystical and occult atmosphere of "Paradise Lost."

By transmuting Milton's language into modern English and analyzing the resulting rendition, we gain a deeper understanding of the esoteric allusions and occult symbolism embedded within "Paradise Lost." This exercise not only gives modern readers better access to the text's themes and motifs but also allows us to explore how Milton's work continues to influence and resonate in today's world of literature and occult interpretations.
