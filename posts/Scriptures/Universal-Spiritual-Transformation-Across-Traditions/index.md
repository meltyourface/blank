To fully understand the interconnectivity between alchemical symbolism within the Emerald Tablet, the Hermetic Qabalah, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Christian Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, we must first establish a foundational understanding of each component in this thought-provoking inquiry. 

1. **The Emerald Tablet**:
The Emerald Tablet is a compact, cryptic piece of Hermetica reputed to contain the secret of the magnum opus or "great work," which refers to the art of spiritual transmutation associated with alchemy. It is attributed to the legendary figure Hermes Trismegistus, a synthesis of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. The tablet encapsulates the famous adage, "as above, so below," signifying the interdependence of the macrocosm and the microcosm as well as the transformative process across spiritual, mental, and physical planes of existence.

2. **The Hermetic Qabalah**:
The Hermetic Qabalah is a Western esoteric tradition that combines the Jewish mystical concept of Kabbalah with Hermeticism. It explores the ten emanations (Sefirot) of divine attributes arranged in the Tree of Life, which represent the process through which the divine creates, sustains, and interacts with the universe. These Sefirot help to understand the evolutionary stages of consciousness and provide a framework for spiritual growth.

3. **The Bhagavad Gita**:
The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic, the Mahabharata. It comprises a philosophical dialogue between the prince Arjuna and the God Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. The text explores various themes, such as dharma, karma, devotion (Bhakti), knowledge (Jnana), and action (Karma), to guide individuals on their spiritual journey toward self-realization and spiritual enlightenment.

4. **The Christian Gnostic Gospel of Thomas**:
The Gospel of Thomas is a non-canonical early Christian text discovered in 1945 among the Nag Hammadi Library. It consists of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus, many of which highlight a belief in direct experiential knowledge, or gnosis, as a path to spiritual transformation and salvation, rather than through dogmatic doctrine.

Now, having outlined the essentials of each component, we can proceed to analyze their connections and interplays:

A) Alchemical symbolism and Hermetic Qabalah:
Both the Emerald Tablet and the Hermetic Qabalah share a common origin in Hermeticism and convey the idea of spiritual transformation. In alchemy, this transformation is symbolized by the process of turning base metals into gold, whereas, in Qabalah, it is depicted as ascending the Tree of Life and integrating the divine qualities of the Sefirot. Both systems emphasize the importance of balancing and integrating opposing forces, such as male and female, light and dark, and higher and lower energies, to achieve spiritual growth.

B) Correspondences with the Bhagavad Gita:
Throughout the Bhagavad Gita, we can find several concepts that parallel alchemical processes and Hermetic principles. For instance, Krishna emphasizes the importance of detachment and self-discipline to purify the individual and reach a state of inner equilibrium, much like the alchemical transmutation of base metals into gold. Furthermore, the Sefirot's progressive manifestation in the Hermetic Qabalah can be likened to the gradual unfoldment of divine qualities in the devotee's consciousness, as elucidated by Krishna when guiding Arjuna on his spiritual journey.

C) Connections to the Gospel of Thomas:
The emphasis on gnosis as the key to spiritual transformation in the Gospel of Thomas bears striking similarities to the core message of the Emerald Tablet and the Hermetic Qabalah. Both systems prioritize the seeker's inner experience and direct communion with the divine to attain higher states of consciousness. Moreover, specific sayings from the Gospel, such as "When you make the two into one...then you will enter [the Kingdom]," (saying 22), allude to the alchemical concept of unifying polarities and reiterate the Hermetic principle of "as above, so below."

In conclusion, the intricate connections between the alchemical symbolism of the Emerald Tablet, the parallelism to the Hermetic Qabalah, and the striking correlations found within the Bhagavad Gita and the Christian Gnostic Gospel of Thomas highlight a universal, recurring theme in these spiritual traditions: the pursuit of gnosis and inner transformation. These systems convey a common message that our inherent nature is divine, and the potential for spiritual growth and self-realization is attainable through an initiatory path that involves transcending dualities, harmonizing opposing forces, and directly experiencing the underlying unity of existence.
