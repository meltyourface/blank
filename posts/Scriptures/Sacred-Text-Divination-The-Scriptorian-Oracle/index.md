## Title: Scriptorian Oracle

Introduction:
The Scriptorian Oracle is a unique divination practice rooted in Scriptural teachings, offering insights and spiritual guidance by tapping into the wisdom of sacred texts. Drawing inspiration from the I Ching, rune stones, and other ancient systems, the Scriptorian Oracle incorporates characters or symbols from the Scriptures, mapping them to precise passages. The divination process involves a ritualistic casting method and a comprehensive guide for interpreting the results, providing users with deep spiritual significance and connections to Scripture.

To create the Scriptorian Oracle, we begin with selecting 64 passages from the sacred texts of various spiritual traditions. Each passage will be assigned a unique symbol from their respective tradition. The selection of passages and symbols can be customized to the practitioner and their spiritual background.

Symbols and Passages:
1. Creation Genesis
1:1 - 2:3 | Christian Cross Symbol

2. Noah's Ark Genesis
6:9 - 9:17 | Dove and Olive Branch Symbol

3. The Ten Commandments Exodus
20:1-17 | Tablets of the Law Symbol

4. The 23rd Psalm | Shepherd's Crook Symbol

... [and so on, completing the selection of 64.]

Ritualistic Casting Method:**Step 1**: Prepare the space
Begin by cleansing the area in which the divination will take place. Light candles, incense, or smudge the space with sage to cleanse and create a sacred atmosphere.
**Step 2**: Invocation
Invoke the presence of your higher power, guardian angels, or spirit guides, requesting their guidance and protection throughout the session.
**Step 3**: Focus on the question or issue at hand
Take a moment to meditate on the issue you seek guidance on, allowing the question to become clear in your mind.
**Step 4**: Cast the Scriptorian Coins
The practitioner uses a set of three coins, each representing one of the elements (Earth, Air, Fire). With the question in mind, one coin is selected (ostensibly at random) and cast onto a grid of the 64 symbols (8 rows by 8 columns), determining the resulting symbol and passage.
**Step 5**: Record the symbols
Using a journal, record the symbol and its associated passage that the coin landed upon.

Interpretation Guide:
Once a symbol and passage have been revealed through the casting, follow these steps to interpret the results:

1. **Read the passage in its entirety**: Consider the context and overarching messages contained within the passage.

2. **Determine the theme of the passage**: Reflect on the main theme and how it relates to the question or issue at hand.

3. **Connect the symbol and theme to your question**: Identify the relationship between the symbol, the theme of the passage, and the question you had initially focused on. What lessons or guidance can be derived from this connection?

4. **Reflect on the guidance**: Take time to meditate on the insights gained and how they can be incorporated into your life to address the issue or question.

Closing the Ritual:
1. **Give thanks**: Express gratitude to the divine forces, angels, or guides that assisted in the session.

2. **Cleanse the space**: Safely extinguish any candles or incense, and clear the energy of the space with a smudging herb or a cleansing spray.

3. **Retain the insights**: Keep a record of the divination session, noting the symbols, passages, and insights gained throughout the process.

By utilizing the Scriptorian Oracle method, practitioners can deepen their connection to Scripture and draw upon the wisdom and guidance it offers for their spiritual journey.
