## Title: Necromantic Siege Weapon Construction Guide - The Soul Reaper

Materials Required:

1. High-quality oak wood – 50 logs (Cut into specific lengths detailed later)
2. Iron nails – 5 pounds
3. Iron bars – 20 (3 feet long)
4. Iron chains – 70 feet (cut into specific lengths detailed later)
5. Heavy-duty wheels – 4
6. Undead summoning crystal – 1
7. Essence of death – 5 vials (Extracted from dead bodies and stored in dark flasks)
8. Skulls (human) – 8
9. Fine horsehair – 2 pounds
10. Dark iron cauldron
11. Athame (ritual dagger)
12. Necromancer robes
13. Dried bat wings – 8
14. Tome of Shadows (spell book)
15. Blood – 5 pints preferably human, or from a slain enemy
16. Candles – 13 (black)
17. Corpse paint
**Step 1**: Gathering Materials

As a necromancer, understand the importance of obtaining certain materials firsthand. Skulls and blood require a deeper understanding of death, and for maximum power, these must be acquired from slain enemies or fallen allies. The Essence of Death can be harvested from the corpses of the deceased, preferably after a battle. The book "Tome of Shadows" is essential for this guide; if you do not possess it, contact a fellow necromancer to obtain one.
**Step 2**: Preparing the Ritual Ground

Find an appropriate location for the construction of the Soul Reaper, preferably at the site of a recent battle or graveyard. Set up the perimeter with the 13 black candles, lighting them in a counterclockwise motion. Wear necromancer robes and the corpse paint, declaring your intent to the spirits.
**Step 3**: Cutting the Oak Wood

Cut the oak logs into the following lengths:

- 2 logs: 16 feet each (Main balancing beams)
- 4 logs: 10 feet each (Axle supports)
- 4 logs: 8 feet each (Braces)
- 10 logs: 4 feet each (Base frame)
**Step 4**: Assembling the Frame

Create the base frame using the 4-foot-long logs, connecting them using iron nails. Attach the 10-foot-long axle supports vertically to the frame. Place the 16-foot-long balancing beams across the top of the axle supports, ensuring they are securely fastened with iron bars and nails.
**Step 5**: Setting the Wheels

Mount the four heavy-duty wheels onto the frame in alignment with the axle supports, securing them with the iron nails and bars.
**Step 6**: Attaching the Iron Chains

Attach the iron chains to the balancing beams, leaving the other end free for now. During the ritualistic invocation, these chains will later be imbued with necromantic power.
**Step 7**: Preparing the Undead Summoning Crystal

Place the undead summoning crystal inside the dark iron cauldron. Surround it with eight human skulls and bat wings, aligning them with the cardinal directions. Pour the essence of death into the cauldron, followed by the five pints of blood.
**Step 8**: Ritualistic Incantation

Wearing your necromancer robes, read from the "Tome of Shadows," invoking the powers of Death and Undeath. **Recite these words**:

"Occultus Mortis qui locus est,
Necromantia et Infernis scientiam,
Adiuva me convocare mortui exercitus,
Obsidione adversarios nostros et in oblivionem,
In nomine Nigrum, Dominus Tenebrarum!"
**Step 9**: Empowering the Device

Draw a sigil of power on the ground beneath the Soul Reaper using the blood from the cauldron. Place the cupped horsehair atop the balancing beams, using the athame to slice your hand and let your blood seep into the hair.
**Step 10**: Summoning the Undead Forces

Using your necromantic power, command the chains to bind the undead beings into your service. The forces of death will rise, entwined with the chains, fueling the destructive abilities of the Soul Reaper.
**Step 11**: Launching the Attack

The Soul Reaper siege weapon is now ready to be unleashed upon your enemies. Annihilate their defenses, commanding the undead forces as they are flung forth, amplifying its lethality through the dark arts.

Remember: True mastery of death and warfare is a lifelong pursuit. May the shadows forever guide you.
