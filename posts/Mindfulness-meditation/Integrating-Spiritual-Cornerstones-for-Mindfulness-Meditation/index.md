In answering this knowledge challenge, we will delve into the essence of each of these spiritual cornerstones – the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, the Hermetic principles, and the concept of nonduality – to discern their underlying patterns and elucidate how they harmonize and complement each other within the practice of mindfulness meditation. This will ultimately illuminate their potential for promoting self-awareness and spiritual growth.

**The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism center around two main teachings**: the understanding of the nature of suffering (Dukkha) and how to alleviate it. **These truths are presented in the following order**:

1. **The Truth of Suffering**: Life inevitably involves suffering, whether physical, mental, or emotional.
2. **The Truth of the Origin of Suffering**: Suffering stems from attachment, desire, and ignorance.
3. **The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering**: By eliminating attachment, desire, and ignorance, we can end suffering.
4. **The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering**: The Eightfold Path, a practical set of ethical and mindful principles, serves as the guide to overcoming suffering and achieving enlightenment.

The Hermetic principles originate from the ancient Greek-Egyptian Hermetic tradition. The seven principles, as outlined in the Kybalion, include:

1. **The Principle of Mentalism**: All reality is a manifestation of the mind.
2. **The Principle of Correspondence**: "As above, so below"; what occurs at one level of existence also happens at other levels.
3. **The Principle of Vibration**: Everything is in constant motion and possesses energy.
4. **The Principle of Polarity**: All phenomena consist of opposing and complementary aspects.
5. **The Principle of Rhythm**: Life has a natural ebb and flow; cycles govern existence.
6. **The Principle of Cause and Effect**: Nothing happens by chance; every action has a corresponding reaction.
7. **The Principle of Gender**: The presence of masculine (active) and feminine (receptive) energies exist in all creation.

Nonduality is a philosophical concept encapsulating the idea that there is no fundamental distinction between the subject (the observer) and the object (that which is observed). In essence, all of existence is one unified, interconnected reality, in which separation is an illusion born of our limited perception.

Now, we shall integrate these three distinct yet interwoven concepts – the Four Noble Truths, the Hermetic principles, and nonduality – into a comprehensive approach to mindfulness meditation.

Mindfulness meditation comprises the attentive observation of the present moment without judgment or attachment. In complementing the Four Noble Truths, mindfulness helps to dismantle suffering by fostering an awareness of the sensations, thoughts, and feelings that arise from attachment and desire and by grounding the practitioner in the present rather than clinging to the past or anticipating the future.

The Hermetic principles also offer valuable insights for mindfulness meditation. For instance, mentalism reminds us that our thoughts shape our reality, thereby underscoring the importance of mindfully directing our attention. Furthermore, the principles of correspondence, rhythm, and cause and effect can guide our focus towards detecting and embracing the interconnected patterns within our external and internal experiences. 

Finally, recognizing the nondual nature of reality during mindfulness meditation practice bridges the gap between the observer and the observed, promoting a sense of unity with the world and fostering a compassionate and holistic view of life.

**Let us consider a metaphor to illustrate the interconnectedness of these principles within mindfulness meditation**: Imagine a tree representing the entirety of existence. The Four Noble Truths act as the roots, keeping you anchored amidst the myriad forms of suffering. The Hermetic principles, akin to the tree's trunk, provide stability and structure in navigating life's complexities. The branches represent the branches of nonduality, reminding us of our interconnectedness with all of existence. In practicing mindfulness meditation, we become aware of the entire tree and, in doing so, attain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place within the grander scheme of life.

In short, integrating the Four Noble Truths, the Hermetic principles, and the concept of nonduality within the practice of mindfulness meditation fosters an all-encompassing pathway to self-awareness and spiritual growth. By applying these potent and complementary spiritual cornerstones, we can dismantle the sources of suffering, nurture a more profound understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe, and ultimately cultivate a compassionate, harmonious, and enlightened existence.
