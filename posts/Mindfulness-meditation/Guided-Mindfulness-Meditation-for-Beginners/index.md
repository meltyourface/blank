## Title: Mindfulness Meditation for Novices - Journey to Inner Peace

Introduction:
Welcome to this guided mindfulness meditation, tailored specifically for novices. As you embark on this journey to inner peace, let us explore progressive muscle relaxation, focused attention on the breath, and the cultivation of non-judgmental awareness of thoughts and emotions. Find a comfortable and quiet space, where you can sit or lie down without any distractions.

Body:
1. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**:
To begin, close your eyes gently and take a few slow, deep breaths. As you inhale, fill your lungs completely, expanding your chest and belly. As you exhale, release any tension or stress from your body.

Now, starting at the top of your head, focus on each muscle group as you progressively relax your body. Tense and relax the muscles in the following order, whilst maintaining deep, rhythmic breaths:
- Forehead
- Eyes
- Cheeks and jaw
- Neck and shoulders
- Arms and hands
- Chest and upper back
- Abdomen and lower back
- Hips, buttocks, and thighs
- Calves and feet

2. **Focused Attention on the Breath**:
As your body becomes more relaxed, shift your attention to the breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils, filling your lungs, and expanding your chest and belly. Feel the warmth of the air as it leaves your body.

Count each breath cycle from one to ten and then start again at one. If your mind wanders, gently redirect it back to your breath and begin counting again. Remember, there is no need to judge or criticize yourself; simply observe your experience without judgment.

3. **Non-Judgmental Awareness of Thoughts and Emotions**:
As you continue to focus on your breath, become aware of any thoughts or emotions that arise. Instead of engaging with them or judging them, simply observe them as if they were clouds passing by in the sky.

Label each thought or emotion with a simple, neutral description, such as "thinking," "planning," "worrying," "joy," or "anger." Allow each thought or emotion to pass, continuing to return your focus to your breath.

4. **Enhancing the Meditation Experience**:
To deepen your meditation practice, begin to notice the intricate details of your experience. Observe the subtle sensations in your body as you breathe, the rhythm of your heartbeat, and the gentle ebb and flow of your thoughts and emotions.

As your practice progresses, you may find yourself becoming more in tune with the present moment, cultivating a sense of inner peace and stillness.

Closing:
Gradually, bring your newfound awareness back to your physical surroundings. Wiggle your fingers and toes and gently stretch your arms and legs. When you are ready, open your eyes and slowly reorient yourself to the room.

Know that you can always return to this practice, using the power of your breath and non-judgmental awareness to find stillness and inner peace in the midst of your daily life. Namaste.
