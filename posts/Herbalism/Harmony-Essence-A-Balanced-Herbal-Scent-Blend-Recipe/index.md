You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Conceptualize and formulate a distinctive signature herbal scent blend by synergizing a minimum of five potent medicinal and aromatherapeutic herbs, specifically tailored for use in creating bespoke candles, perfumes, or essential oil diffusers. This blend should exhibit a balanced sensory experience drawn from various notes, such as top, middle, and base notes, with its components selected for both their olfactory characteristics, and therapeutic properties, such as calming, invigorating, or focusing effects. Additionally, outline any contraindications or potential allergens associated with the chosen herbs, and provide a detailed breakdown of the proportions required for creating a consistent scent profile in each of the three mentioned applications, taking into account varying concentration levels and evaporation rates.

I have conceptualized and formulated a distinctive signature herbal scent blend called "Harmony Essence," which synergizes five potent medicinal and aromatherapeutic herbs. This blend is specifically tailored for use in bespoke candles, perfumes, or essential oil diffusers, and offers a balanced sensory experience with various notes.

**Ingredients**: 
1. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) – Top note
2. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) – Middle note
3. Frankincense (Boswellia sacra) – Middle note
4. Sandalwood (Santalum album) – Base note
5. Vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) – Base note

Therapeutic Properties:
- Lavender: Calming, stress-relieving, and soothing
- Rosemary: Invigorating, stimulating, and memory-enhancing
- Frankincense: Relaxing, grounding, and balancing
- Sandalwood: Calming, focusing, and harmonizing
- Vetiver: Grounding, focusing, and restorative

Contraindications and Potential Allergens:
- Lavender: Avoid during early pregnancy and during breastfeeding.
- Rosemary: Avoid using with high blood pressure, epilepsy, and during pregnancy.
- Frankincense: Possible skin sensitivity; avoid using during pregnancy.
- Sandalwood: Some sources state it is contraindicated during pregnancy, but there isn't clear evidence; caution is advised.
- Vetiver: Generally safe, but may cause skin sensitivity in some individuals.

Proportions for Scent Profile (per 10 ml carrier oil for candles, perfumes, or diffusers):
1. Lavender: 3 drops
2. Rosemary: 2 drops
3. Frankincense: 2 drops
4. Sandalwood: 2 drops
5. Vetiver: 1 drop

For candles, the blend should be mixed at a ratio of 6% of the essential oils to the weight of wax (for instance, 6 grams of oil per 100 grams of wax) to create a well-balanced scent. For perfumes, one can use a ratio of 15-20% of essential oils to the carrier, such as alcohol or a blend of alcohol and distilled water, and let it age for at least four weeks for the scent to mature. For essential oil diffusers, add 3-5 drops of the blend to the water in your diffuser, adjusting the amount based on the size of the room and personal preference. 

Remember to always perform a patch test before applying any blend to a larger area in your body and consult a healthcare professional if you have any medical conditions or are pregnant or breastfeeding before using essential oils.
