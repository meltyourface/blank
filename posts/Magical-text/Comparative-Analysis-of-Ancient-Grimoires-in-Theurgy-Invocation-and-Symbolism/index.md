  In the complex and interconnected world of magical texts, encompassing a myriad of cultures, traditions, and practices, identify the core commonalities among three significant grimoires from distinct historical periods and magical lineages, considering the way they approach theurgy, invocation, and symbolic representation, in order to reveal an underlying universal thread that bridges these seemingly disparate works.

Answering the posed knowledge challenge requires an in-depth understanding of magical texts, their historical contexts, and their contributions to the practices of theurgy, invocation, and symbolic representation. To address this challenge, we shall examine three distinct grimoires from different historical periods and magical lineages: The Egyptian Book of the Dead, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and The Book of Abramelin. 

1. The Egyptian Book of the Dead (ca. 1550 BCE)
This ancient Egyptian funerary text consists of spells, prayers, and instructions aimed at guiding the deceased safely through the afterlife. The theology expressed in this text revolves around the belief in life after death, and the importance of securing a favorable judgment from the gods to ensure entry into the heavenly realm. 

2. The Lesser Key of Solomon (17th-century CE)
The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as the Lemegeton, is a compendium of grimoires containing information on demonology, angelology, and magical rituals. It is often attributed to the biblical King Solomon, but the true origins of the text are unknown. The book focuses on the conjuration and control of spirits, both angelic and demonic, for the practitioner's will. 

3. The Book of Abramelin (15th-century CE)
The Book of Abramelin, often attributed to Abraham von Worms, outlines a complex system of Kabbalistic magic centered on the summoning and control of good spirits to protect the practitioner from dangerous forces. The book emphasizes the importance of both personal ethics and a strong connection with divine forces in the attainment of magical power.

By comparing these three grimoires, we can identify core commonalities underlying their approach to theurgy, invocation, and symbolic representation, highlighting a universal thread that bridges these distinct works.

**Theurgy**:
At the core of each grimoire lies the belief in the possibility of communion with divine or supernatural beings through rituals and practices. The Egyptian Book of the Dead is focused on honoring the gods and ensuring a smooth journey in the afterlife, while The Lesser Key of Solomon and The Book of Abramelin share the belief in the power of supernatural beings and their ability to shape and influence the material world.

**Invocation**:
Invoking entities plays a crucial role in all three grimoires. The Lesser Key of Solomon details specific rituals for summoning spirits and angels, including sigils, incantations, and guidelines for precise actions. The Book of Abramelin outlines methods for contacting one's Holy Guardian Angel and attaining knowledge and conversation. Similarly, The Egyptian Book of the Dead is rife with incantations, prayers, and spells designed to call upon the gods in the afterlife, demonstrating the importance of invocation.

Symbolic Representation:
Symbolic representation is key to understanding the grimoires' contexts and magical systems. The Egyptian Book of the Dead heavily utilizes hieroglyphs, symbolic imagery connecting it to Egyptian mythology and theology. The Lesser Key of Solomon leverages a series of sigils and symbols to represent the spirits it seeks to summon, while The Book of Abramelin employs the use of magical squares and kabbalistic concepts to express its meaning.

In conclusion, the grimoires The Egyptian Book of the Dead, The Lesser Key of Solomon, and The Book of Abramelin, though vastly different in origin and context, share a universal thread in their approach to theurgy, invocation, and symbolic representation. Each text balances the practitioner's belief in divine or supernatural forces and their ability to interact with these powers through rituals, invocations, and the use of symbolism. These commonalities illuminate the interconnected and dynamic nature of magical texts and their influence on subsequent generations of practitioners, ultimately revealing the enduring and evolving nature of esoteric practices throughout human history.
