Ritualistic Procedure: Rite of the Liminal Chrysalis

The Rite of the Liminal Chrysalis is designed to eradicate malevolent energies and purify cursed artifacts with absolute efficacy. The ritual calls upon powerful sacred elements, incantations, and ceremonial actions to dispel any supernatural threats.

Core Steps of the Ritual:

1. Preparation: The ritual must be performed during the waning moon, a time of purification and banishment. Choose a quiet and secluded location where the energies of nature are strong, ideally near a convergence of ley lines or a sacred grove.

2. Assemble the Materials: Gather the following sacred elements:
   - An altar composed of natural materials such as stone or wood
   - Four elemental items representing the four ancient elements: a lit candle (fire), a bowl of water (water), a feather (air), and a small mound of earth (earth)
   - A white, black, and silver candle to represent purity, banishment, and transformation respectively
   - A circle of salt mixed with crushed lavender and sage for protection and purification
   - A vessel made of iron or other magnetized metal, known to be capable of capturing and containing malevolent energies
   - A sigil specific to the cursed artifact drawn on a piece of parchment

3. Prepare the Ritual Space: Cleanse the space by burning sacred herbs such as sage, palo santo, or cedar. Create a protective circle by pouring the salt mixture in a counterclockwise motion, leaving an entrance in the south. Place the elemental items at the cardinal directions of the circle (north-earth, east-air, south-fire, and west-water). The artifact and the parchment sigil are placed on the altar.

4. Purification: Enter the circle from the south, while carrying the three candles and close the circle by completing the salt line. Light the white, black, and silver candles while stating the intention to purify, banish, and transform.

5. Invoke the Guardians: Begin at the north and move counterclockwise, calling upon the guardians of the elemental realms to lend their power: "Guardians of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water, lend me your aid in this rite of cleansing and transformation."

6. The Potent Incantation: Begin the incantation by stating: "Malevolent energies within, hear my words of power." Recite an incantation specific to the cursed artifact and imbued with the energy of supernatural terror. A segment of the incantation should include "(artifact's name), (sigil's name), be cleansed by the light!"

7. Channel the Power: Visualize a sphere of protective energy enveloping the artifact, radiating the combined powers of the elements, the guardians, and the incantation.

8. Seal the Malevolence: Place the iron vessel upon the artifact. Visualize any remaining malignant energy being drawn into the vessel. Chant three times: "From cursed heavens to clean earth, wicked darkness is now confined."

9. Closing the Ritual: Thank the elemental guardians. Exit the circle through the south. Allow the black and silver candles to burn out on their own. Bury the sigil and the cooled black candle remnants offsite.

Examples of Haunted Objects and Adjustments for Each Case:

A. The Dybbuk Box: A wine cabinet said to contain a malicious spirit called a "dybbuk." 
   - Adjust the incantation to incorporate Hebrew phrases, and draw a Magen David as the custom sigil. Use a traditional oil lamp instead of a candle for the fire element.

B. The Cursed Painting of the Crying Boy: Allegedly, homes where these paintings hung were prone to devastating fires while the painting remained eerily undamaged.
   - Adjust the incantation to focus on water elements. Create a sigil specifically geared towards fire protection. Wet the parchment sigil with the water element after the ritual to symbolize extinguishing the curse.

C. The Female Pharaoh's Necklace: Legend has it that whoever wears this necklace will experience both great fortune and terrible calamities.
   - Adjust the incantation to include references to Ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses. Design a unique sigil incorporating the Eye of Horus. Offer libations of beer and milk to the deities during the ritual.
