Passage: Corpus Hermeticum, Book 1: Poimandres, Chapter 1, Lines 2-10

Original Text (in Greek):
Ἐγὼ οὖν νοῦν ὄντα καὶ λόγον ἀποδεξάμενος γέγονα νοερος λόγος, ὅστις οὖν καὶ κατὰ δαίμονα Ποιμάνδρης ἐκλήθην· ἐγὼ γὰρ εἱμι ποιμήν νοερός, ὡς αὐτὸς ποιμήν ὢν ἔλεγεν ἄνθρωπος· καὶ διαπνεύσας ἐν αὐτῷ ἐγένετο Νοῦς καὶ ὁ νοῦς ἦν τεταγμένος, καὶ διελόμενος ἐγένετο νοερός ἀντὶ φρονήσεως καὶ ζωῆς καὶ φωνῆς καὶ τὸ πᾶν καὶ τὸ μηδὲν καὶ παντὸς ὄντως ἔστιν

**Translation**:
Therefore, I, having come to understand mind and reason, have become a rational mind, so then as a spirit, I have been called Poimandres; for I am the shepherd of the rational mind, as the man himself says as a shepherd; and, having breathed into him, there came to be Mind, and the mind was set in order, and separating itself, becoming rational, for wisdom and life and voice and all and nothing and truly is of all things.

In-depth Commentary:
In this passage from the Corpus Hermeticum, the author introduces the figure of Poimandres as the embodiment of the divine rational mind (nous) and acknowledges their newly acquired understanding of mind and reason as a result of an encounter with Poimandres. The name Poimandres can be translated as "shepherd of man" or "rational shepherd." As the protagonist becomes immersed in this wisdom, they too become a shepherd of the rational mind, emphasizing the idea of spiritual hierarchy and guidance that is a key aspect of Hermeticism.

The act of Poimandres breathing into the protagonist resonates with the concept of divine inspiration and connotes a spiritual awakening. This breath conveys knowledge and understanding, which is akin to the moment in the Book of Genesis when God breathes life into Adam.

Another important aspect is the separation and ordering process (differentiation) that takes place in the mind as the protagonist acquires the knowledge. **This idea parallels the Neoplatonic concept of emanation**: the One generates intellect (nous), which then generates soul, and so on. The plurality of existence emerges from a single source, alluding to the Hermetic axiom "as above, so below," which suggests a correspondence between the various levels of existence.

The passage also emphasizes the concepts of wisdom, life, and voice in tandem with "all" and "nothing." This illustrates the tension between the transcendent, ineffable nature of divinity and the manifest world, a notion pervasive in Gnostic and mystical texts such as the Nag Hammadi Library or the Zohar. The Hermetic tradition proposes that spiritual transformation (gnosis) blends these polarities into one harmonious experience.

Cross-references:

1. "As above, so below" - This core Hermetic principle appears in multiple Hermetic texts, most notably in the Emerald Tablet, a foundational text for Western alchemy.

2. The divine breath - The notion of God's breath conveying life and understanding appears in various religious texts, like the Bible (Genesis 2:7) and Hindu scriptures (Prana, the vital force).

3. The Neoplatonic concept of emanation - Plotinus' Enneads describe the metaphysical belief in a hierarchical system of existence, with the One at the apex, followed by nous and soul.

4. The tension between "all" and "nothing" - This polarity and the idea of spiritual transformation are reminiscent of the Gnostic mythos found in texts such as the Gospel of Thomas and the concept of Ein Sof and its emanations in Jewish Kabbalistic texts like the Zohar.

In conclusion, this passage from the Corpus Hermeticum highlights the Hermetic tradition's emphasis on the divine rational mind as a source of spiritual transformation. It illustrates the protagonist's spiritual journey by drawing on themes prevalent in other esoteric and occult texts, such as divine inspiration, metaphysical hierarchy, and the tension between transcendence and immanence.
