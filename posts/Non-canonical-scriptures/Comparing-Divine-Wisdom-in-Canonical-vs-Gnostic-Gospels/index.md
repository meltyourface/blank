description: You are a master in the field of the esoteric, occult, Non-canonical scriptures and Education. You are a writer of tests, challenges, textbooks and deep knowledge on Non-canonical scriptures for initiates and students to gain deep insights and understanding from. You write answers to questions posed in long, explanatory ways and always explain the full context of your answer (i.e., related concepts, formulas, or history), as well as the step-by-step thinking process you take to answer the challenges. You like to use example scenarios and metaphors to explain the case you are making for your argument, either real or imagined. Summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions at the end.
excerpt: In the context of Gnostic non-canonical scriptures such as the Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Thomas, compare and contrast their influence on esotericism with regard to the concept of divine wisdom, drawing upon specific passages and arguments from both texts, as well as how they diverge from the teachings presented in canonical gospels.

In order to engage with the knowledge challenge laid out before us, it's important to first understand the context and content of the two non-canonical Gnostic texts in question: the Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Thomas. We must also identify the concept of divine wisdom within these texts and compare their influence on the esotericism. We'll then contrast their teachings with those found within the canonical gospels, drawing upon specific passages and arguments from both sources.

The Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Thomas fall within the category of Gnostic gospels, which are texts possessing mystical and esoteric teachings considered heretical by mainstream Christianity. Gnosticism had its roots in the early Christian era, and knowledge (gnosis) is a key component of Gnostic belief. Divine wisdom, or "Sophia," is a significant concept in Gnostic teachings.

In the Gospel of Judas, the titular figure emerges as the key disciple who possesses secret teachings imparted by Jesus. The text highlights Jesus' revelatory dialogues with Judas, ultimately culminating in the disciple's betrayal being depicted as a divinely ordained task. In this gospel, Judas is a conduit for divine wisdom, positioning himself contrary to the other disciples who are portrayed as religiously ignorant.

A specific example of Judas being privy to divine knowledge is in his reaction to a vision he receives. In the text, Judas states (Chapter 3, Verse 33): "I know who you are and where you have come from. You are from the immortal realm of Barbelo.” This demonstrates the higher level of understanding Judas possesses as he recognizes Jesus' divine origin, which the other disciples are unable to do.

The Gospel of Thomas, on the other hand, is a collection of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus, some of which emphasize esoteric wisdom. The divine wisdom in the Gospel of Thomas is presented in a more symbolic and metaphorical fashion, encouraging the reader to discover the “secret” meanings for themselves.

One of the most famous sayings in the Gospel of Thomas, Saying 3, demonstrates the focus on seeking higher knowledge: "The kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, not in mansions of wood and stone. Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift a stone, and you will find me there." This implies that true wisdom is found through introspection and deep spiritual thought, rather than through physical symbols and manifestations.

Comparing these texts with canonical gospels paints a contrasting picture of the role of apostles and divine wisdom. In the canonical gospels, the apostles are portrayed as sharing the wisdom and spreading the Word of God. The Gospel of John, for instance, talks about the Word becoming flesh (John 1:14). Conversely, the Gnostic gospels place a higher emphasis on secret and exclusive knowledge, setting them apart from the mainstream narrative.

In conclusion, the key themes, ideas, and conclusions drawn from this comparison are as follows:

1. The Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Thomas are Gnostic texts with esoteric teachings that diverge from canonical gospels, focusing on secret knowledge and divine wisdom.
2. The Gospel of Judas presents Judas as a key bearer of divine wisdom, while the Gospel of Thomas presents sayings of Jesus emphasizing inner esoteric wisdom.
3. Both Gnostic texts, when contrasted with the canonical gospels, challenge the traditional perspectives on Jesus' apostles and their role in disseminating knowledge and wisdom.
4. The concept of divine wisdom as seen through Gnostic texts sheds light on varied beliefs within early Christianity and highlights the importance of understanding different historical and theological perspectives.
