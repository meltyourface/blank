(Verse 1)
In the realm of darkness we once dwelt,
Bound by chains of our own making,
Searching endlessly for deliverance,
A spark of hope amid the chaos trembling.

(Chorus)
Arise, O weary soul, arise!
Behold, the dawn of grace awakens,
Journey through the shadows into light,
Where truth and love shall be thy guiding star.

(Verse 2)
From the depths, a whisper calls our name,
Beckoning with love and silent mystery,
Grasping hands of spirit, we ascend,
The labyrinth of self we traverse, yearning.

(Bridge)
Step by step, as we climb the sacred way,
Fear and doubt give way to strength and wisdom,
Ever closer, the summits of our being,
A beacon to remind us we are One.

(Verse 3)
At the pinnacle, we drink from wells of truth,
Seeing clearly through the eyes of soul's embrace,
Transformed, the old selves fall like weary robes,
A new creation, born in light and grace.

(Chorus)
Arise, O weary soul, arise!
Behold, the dawn of grace awakens,
Journey through the shadows into light,
Where truth and love shall be thy guiding star.

(Outro)
In gratitude, we share the sacred gifts,
Enlightened hearts, a symphony of peace,
Together, hand in hand, we walk the path,
Guiding others to awaken their own light.
