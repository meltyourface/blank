Before we delve into the symbolism, it is essential to provide a brief overview of the hymn "Stabat Mater." This hymn is a 13th-century Latin Catholic hymn that is attributed to Jacopo da Todi or Jacopone da Todi, an Italian Franciscan friar and poet. It will serve as the basis of our analysis with respect to its relationship with esotericism, occultism, the eternal feminine, the Tree of Life, and the concepts of suffering and redemption.

"Stabat Mater" primarily focuses on the grief and sorrow that Mary, the mother of Jesus, experienced as she stood by her sonâ€™s crucifixion. Through this narrative, the hymn amplifies the emotional and spiritual dimensions of suffering and redemption central to Christianity. In order to explore the intricate connections between these themes and the hymn, our analysis will be divided into three main sections: the eternal feminine, the Tree of Life, and suffering and redemption.

1. The Eternal Feminine
In various esoteric and occult traditions, the eternal feminine represents the divine aspect of femininity, embodying wisdom, compassion, and nurturing qualities. Mary, as the mother of Jesus in "Stabat Mater", exemplifies this archetype. The hymn emphasizes the depths of her sorrow and compassion for her son's suffering. Thus, her presence at the crucifixion scene embodies the eternal feminine quality of unwavering love and devotion in the face of immense pain and tragedy.

Additionally, her role as the mother of Jesus connects her to the broader theme of the divine feminine. As the spiritual 'Mother of God', Mary represents an intermediary between the divine and the earthly realms. This union of the heavenly and earthly defines the central aspect of the eternal feminine and its role in creation and spiritual growth.

2. The Tree of Life
The Tree of Life is an essential symbol in various esoteric and occult traditions. In Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism, the Tree of Life represents the ten Sephirot: divine emanations through which the Infinite manifests itself. In the context of "Stabat Mater," we can draw a connection between the Tree of Life and the crucifix upon which Jesus was nailed.

The crucifix can be interpreted as a manifestation of the Tree of Life. Jesus's crucifixion represents the merging of the earthly and divine realms, facilitating spiritual transformation and enlightenment. Furthermore, the Tree of Life's emphasis on interconnectedness reflects the interconnected nature of suffering and redemption, which we will discuss in the next section.

3. Suffering and Redemption
Throughout "Stabat Mater," the concept of suffering is vividly portrayed. The hymn describes the intense anguish experienced by both Jesus and Mary as they endure extreme physical, emotional, and spiritual torment. In esotericism and occultism, suffering is considered an essential component in the process of spiritual growth and transformation. It is through the experience of pain and hardship that one can attain self-awareness, inner strength, and empathy, leading to redemption and spiritual elevation.

Redemption is a central theme in the hymn, as it highlights the salvific power of Jesus's sacrifice. Through his suffering and death on the cross, Jesus offers redemption for humanity. This act mirrors the spiritual alchemy present in many esoteric and occult teachings: the transformation of pain and suffering into spiritual growth and enlightenment.

In conclusion, the hymn "Stabat Mater" serves as a rich source of symbolism and connections to esoteric and occult concepts. The portrayal of Mary exemplifies the eternal feminine, highlighting her divine qualities of compassion and love. The Tree of Life is embodied in the crucifix, showcasing the spiritual interconnectedness of life and the divine. Lastly, the themes of suffering and redemption illustrate the transformative power of pain and tragedy in the pursuit of spiritual growth and enlightenment.
