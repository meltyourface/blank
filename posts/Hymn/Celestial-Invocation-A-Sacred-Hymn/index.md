description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Hymn, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a mesmerizing incantation rooted in Hymn traditions, designed to invoke the energies of the ancient deities and celestial realms into a consecrated sanctuary during a ceremonial rite. Ensure that the invocational chant includes at least three verses and a recurring chorus, incorporating sacred symbols, historic elements, and thematic echoes relating to the chosen deities. The chant should be harmoniously structured and specifically tailored to deepen the connection to the divine, amplifying both the intensity and efficacy of the ritual practice.

Verse 1:
Hear our call, O ancient ones, within the sacred halls,
We beckon thee, with voice and song, answer our enthralled calls,
Astral spirits, celestial realms, we seek thy wisdom and grace,
Ignite within our sanctuary the presence of thy embrace.

Chorus:
Ave, Ave Divinitas, incantamus tua veritas,
Hymn, Hymn of mystic harmony, delight the gods and set us free.

Verse 2:
From star-crossed realms of timeless night come forth, O deities,
Adorn our rites with sigils bright and bindless energy,
Empyrean hosts, whose timeless gaze let spiral galaxies flee,
We summon thee, in this hallowed space, with celestial decree.

Chorus:
Ave, Ave Divinitas, incantamus tua veritas,
Hymn, Hymn of mystic harmony, delight the gods and set us free.

Verse 3:
As we dance the sacred steps of ancient rites, O precious ones,
May thy resonances resound from the birth to setting sun,
Like onyx smoke and silver flame, our song ascends on high,
Bind us tight with sacred trust, eternal heavenly ties.

Chorus:
Ave, Ave Divinitas, incantamus tua veritas,
Hymn, Hymn of mystic harmony, delight the gods and set us free.

Coda:
In unity of voice and soul and transcendent melody,
We weave our heavy hearts and minds with ancient alchemy,
And together, raise a sacred space, to touch eternity,
By the power of our Hymn, grant us divine serenity.
