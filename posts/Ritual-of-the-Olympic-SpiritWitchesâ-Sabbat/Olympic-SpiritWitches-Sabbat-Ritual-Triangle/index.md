The Triangle of Manifestation: Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat Goetia Rite

**Introduction**:
The Triangle of Manifestation for the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat takes inspiration from the Triangle of Art in traditional Goetic practice but incorporates specific symbols, sigils, and elements representing the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat. This elaborate ritual triangle aims to summon and communicate with the spirits of the Goetia while paying homage to the unique elements of the Witch's Sabbat.

Triangle Description:

1. Base Structure: A large equilateral triangle drawn on the ground, with each side measuring approximately 3 feet. Each corner of the triangle is marked with a black candle. In the center of the triangle, a smaller triangle is drawn, pointing in the same direction as the larger triangle.

2. Surrounding the Triangle: A circle is drawn surrounding the triangle. This circle serves as a protective barrier for the practitioner and is adorned with symbols representing the practitioner's connection to the Witch's Sabbat, such as the Brocken Spectre, the Black Mass, and the Dance of the Dead.

3. Sigils & Symbols: Within the triangle, intricate sigils and symbols are drawn, representing the chosen Goetic spirit's attributes, rank, and strengths. These sigils and symbols are outlined with an air of mastery, weaving them together in a way that enhances the spirit's connection to the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat.

4. The Spirit's Seal: In the center of the small triangle, the Seal of the Goetic spirit is drawn. This seal is a representation of the spirit's unique signature, enabling the practitioner to call upon the specific spirit they wish to summon.

5. Olympic Element: The five Olympic spirits (Aratron, Bethor, Phaleg, Och, and Hagith) are represented in the inner circle adjoining the large triangle. This representation allows for the incorporation of the Olympic spirits' wisdom, influence, and guidance during the ritual.

Ritual Instructions:

1. Cleanse and consecrate the area for the ritual. It is essential to have a harmonious and sacred space for the Triangle of Manifestation.

2. Light the three black candles at each corner of the triangle, invoking protection and setting the atmosphere for the Witch's Sabbat.

3. Draw the triangle, circle, and sigils using a ritual tool, such as a consecrated athame or a wand, imbuing the symbols with intention and power.

4. Chant invocations specific to the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat while focusing on the sigils and symbols within the triangle. This will prepare the practitioner for invoking the chosen Goetic spirit.

5. Begin the summoning ritual by reciting the conjuration specific to the chosen Goetic spirit while holding an image of the spirit's sigil in your mind.

6. Once the spirit has been summoned, engage in communication while remaining within the protective circle. It is vital to maintain a respectful attitude, and always remember to thank the spirit for their guidance and wisdom before concluding the ritual.

7. To close the ritual, banish the spirit using a License to Depart and cleanse the area to ensure all residual energies have been dissipated.

By incorporating the intricate symbolism and sigils of the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat, as well as the chosen Goetic spirit's attributes, the Triangle of Manifestation enhances the summoning procedure's complexity and efficacy, opening doors for deeper exploration and understanding.
