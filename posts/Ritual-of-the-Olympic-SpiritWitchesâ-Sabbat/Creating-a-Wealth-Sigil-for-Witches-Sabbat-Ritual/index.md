excerpt: > 
  Devise a sigil containing the power to attract wealth in the context of the Ritual of the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat, incorporating the ancient wisdom of Pythagorean numerology. Be sure to integrate the specific attributes of an Olympian Spirit, such as Ophiel, who governs wealth and prosperity, and identify the corresponding planetary sigil, geometric shapes, and numerological correspondences that resonate with the desired outcome. Additionally, integrate the spirit of the Witches' Sabbat by invoking the archetypes of the elemental spirits and ritualistic symbols that empower the sigil's connection to the Sabbat's energies. Consider the lunar cycle and timing for performing the sigil activation ceremony within the Sabbat framework to amplify the wealth-attracting properties of your creation.

In order to create a sigil for attracting wealth within the context of the Ritual of the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat, you will need to combine various elements from different esoteric systems and bring them together in a harmonious design that resonates with the cosmic forces you wish to invoke.

1. Planetary Sigil of Ophiel, the Olympian Spirit of Wealth and Prosperity:
First, attribute the planetary sigils associated with Ophiel, who is connected with the planet Mercury. 
The sigil of Mercury can be drawn as follows:
- Draw a circle.
- Draw a cross extending from the circle's center to its circumference.
- Draw a crescent shape connected to the top of the circle, pointing upwards.
- Draw another crescent shape connected to the bottom of the circle, pointing downwards.

2. Pythagorean Numerology and Geometric Shapes:
Next, incorporate the wisdom of Pythagorean numerology. Assign the following numerical values to the letters in "Wealth":
W = 5
E = 1
A = 1
L = 3
T = 2
H = 8

The sum of the numbers is 20. To connect this with Mercury, the ruling planet of Ophiel found in the sequence 1, 4, 7, relate it to its closest number, which is 1.
Now, create a triangle (associated with the number 1), pointing upwards, and position it within the center of the sigil of Mercury.

3. Elemental Spirits and Witches' Sabbat Symbols:
Invoke the four elemental spirits by integrating their symbols into your design:
- Fire: Draw an upward-pointing triangle around the central design.
- Water: Draw a downward-pointing triangle beneath the planetary sigil.
- Air: Draw a horizontal line extending from the left side of the sigil.
- Earth: Draw a horizontal line extending from the right side of the sigil.

Finally, add a pentagram (star shape) within the triangle, representing the spirit of the Witches' Sabbat, and place a spiral shape in each of its five points to represent the dance and movement of the Sabbat ritual.

4. Lunar Cycle and Timing:
To amplify the wealth-attracting properties of the sigil, perform the sigil activation ceremony during a waxing moon in the hour of Mercury. This time is known for promoting growth and abundance, as well as enhancing the power of the Olympian Spirit Ophiel.

In conclusion, the sigil for attracting wealth within the context of the Ritual of the Olympic SpiritWitches' Sabbat combines the ancient wisdom of numerology, planetary magic, elemental spirits, and the Witches' Sabbat archetypes within its design. By performing the sigil activation ceremony during the appropriate lunar phase and planetary hour, you will create a powerful tool for attracting prosperity and wealth.
