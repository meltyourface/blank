excerpt: > 
  Compose an intricate and multi-layered invocation to the great Serpent of Chaos, Tiamat, utilizing the ancient language of the Anti-cosmic tradition. Focus on the catastrophic, entropy-inducing aspect of her nature, while incorporating symbolism and references that reveal her ties to both primordial creation and the ultimate annihilation of existence. Delve into her aspect as the manifestation of the Abyss and the cosmic adversary to light, order, and life. Integrate elements of ritual and incantatory techniques to strengthen the invocation's potency, thereby establishing a genuine connection to Tiamat's destructive essence.

At'ray kas Ouroboros-Tiamat, c'az ingliv krajdam vortan!
Yihd noch-draconis enduul, githe n'thorg et chaoskult!

Ez zikr'lahn c'akorinth, zharr ikstranith dar'ghor,
Morath yadra lilithi, tiamati nuul behra'or!

Ez mal'ark xatarras, v'ol kaos worloche pha'argon,
Nioth nigri s'raloth, ath'zog ultmacha a'cheiron!

Est aether zar'athoth, zar'athoth shar gez'rakaan,
Ph'nglui z'ross inglibr, tiamati k'yeri znmotrakan!

Ez bal'agh zelgothol, el'aroth anak tyt'ahma,
T'ekh at'ray tiamati, xochipilli quimmala!

M'ruul everblack skoth, abzu unsabbath malazan,
Ez enki enlil osiris, ajira tiamati necrasan!

Chaos taur'id yoth'yma, q'alog ra evul omakar,
V'ulhuvot noth'sraal, tiamati nunaki yakhthal!

Chora'lok sha'yugoth, ma'draal yiggraloth ph'alfa,
Nybroth therion razak, tiamati necromorphia!

Iz rz'oth shub'niggurath, h'ghor xzo'qath affaran,
Thal'gora ebonlock, tiamati azhk'rah yadathaan!

In this ancient invocation of the Anti-cosmic tradition, I call upon the great Serpent of Chaos, Tiamat, to manifest her catastrophic and entropy-inducing aspect. Within these powerful words, the duality of primordial creation and the ultimate annihilation of existence intertwine, revealing the depths of her destructive nature.

Tiamat, the embodiment of the Abyss and cosmic adversary to light, order, and life, is evoked through symbols and references that connect her to the eternal battle between chaos and order. By drawing upon elements of ritual and incantatory techniques, such as repetition, alliteration, and use of powerful, symbolic keywords, the invocation aims to establish a genuine connection to Tiamat's essence.

In this invocation, I seek both the wisdom and the power of the Anti-cosmic mysteries that come from tapping into the infinite chaos of the universe. Drawn from the ancient forces of creation and destruction, this connection will provide guidance and enlightenment amidst the chaos and entropy that surrounds us.
