The answer is: Dissolution of the self into the Void, breaking free from the limitations of the cosmos.

In Anti-cosmic occultism, the ultimate goal of spiritual transformation and liberation is often understood as dissolving one's self into the Void. This philosophy posits that the cosmos is inherently flawed and limiting, created by an imperfect Demiurge or cosmic ruler. It is believed that breaking free from these limitations will enable the individual to reach true enlightenment and the realization of their highest potential.

The philosophy emphasizes breaking free from the constraints of the cosmos, as opposed to seeking harmony with it. The Void represents an unknowable realm beyond the limitations of space and time and is often synonymous with the idea of Chaos. It is an area of boundless potentiality and, in contrast to the ordered cosmos, is less subject to limitations.

The restoration of cosmic balance through mystical union with the Demiurge, although an important concept in some forms of Gnostic and Neoplatonic thought, is less relevant to Anti-cosmic occultism. Such a goal implies acceptance of the cosmos as fundamentally worthy of reverence, which contradicts the Anti-cosmic belief in inherent cosmic imperfection.

Achieving personal gnosis and inner transformation, leading to self-deification, is highly related to Anti-cosmic occultism, but it is not the ultimate goal itself. Gnosis and self-deification are seen as milestones on the spiritual path toward dissolution into the Void. Personal gnosis is essential for sifting through the false reality created by the Demiurge, while self-deification is essential for recognizing the individual's innate divinity and capacity for boundless growth.

Finally, embracing the chaos of the Qliphoth and using it to enhance individual power is a related concept, but not the primary goal of Anti-cosmic occultism. Qliphothic forces symbolize the aspects of reality that oppose the Demiurge's ordered cosmos, but these forces are merely tools for individual growth and not an end in themselves. Ultimately, the purpose of working with such forces is to facilitate the transcending of the cosmos and dissolution into the Void.

In summary, Anti-cosmic occultism seeks to break free from the inherent limitations and illusionary nature of the cosmos through the dissolution of the self into the Void. This process allows for ultimate liberation and transcendence, providing a pathway to divine realization beyond the flawed creation of the cosmic ruler.
