The Thirteen Divisions of the Nightside in the Qliphothic Tree of Life

The Thirteen Divisions of the Nightside in the Qliphothic Tree of Life is the aspect most associated with the overarching belief system that aims to return to a state of chaos or uncreation in the context of Anti-cosmic occultism. 

**Explanation**:

Anti-cosmic occultism is a form of spiritual practice that opposes the material world's cosmic order and strives to return to a state of primordial chaos. The movement's core belief is that the material world is inherently flawed and created by a malevolent or ignorant demiurge, which is why adherents demonstrate opposition to the cosmic order and alignment with chaotic, anti-cosmic, and entropic aspects of reality.

Among the options given, the Thirteen Divisions of the Nightside in the Qliphothic Tree of Life best exemplifies Anti-cosmic occultism's fundamental beliefs. The Qliphothic Tree of Life, a representation of the "Shadow" side of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, is an important concept in Anti-cosmic occultism. The Qliphoth embraces the dark, chaotic, and destructive forces that oppose the ten sephirot (emanations) in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Each Qlipha represents a spiritual force that stands in opposition to a sephira, embodying the antithesis of that emanation. Collectively, the Thirteen Divisions of the Nightside in the Qliphothic Tree of Life signify a return to chaos and a dissolution of the flawed creation, aligning with the overarching belief system of Anti-cosmic occultism.

In contrast, the other options focus on different aspects of spiritual or philosophical beliefs that do not fully encapsulate Anti-cosmic occultism's goal of returning to a state of chaos:

1. **The concept of Vama Marga in the Left Hand Path**: While the Left Hand Path, which engages in practices deemed taboo by more mainstream religious or spiritual communities, shares some elements with Anti-cosmic occultism, the concept of Vama Marga is more specifically associated with the tantric practices of Hinduism and its particular forms, as Vama Marga literally translates to the "Left Hand Path" in Sanskrit. Thus, it doesn't encompass the specific goal of returning to a state of chaos or uncreation.

2. **The philosophical stance of existential nihilism**: Nihilism, a philosophical position that denies any intrinsic meaning or purpose to life, does not necessarily align with the ideals of Anti-cosmic occultism. While nihilism may share some attitudes about the worthlessness or flaws of the material world, it does not actively promote a return to chaos or seek to align with the primal destructive forces that Anti-cosmic occultism does.

3. **The Great Work in Hermeticism**: The Great Work, also known as Magnum Opus, is an alchemical term referring to the process of personal transformation, becoming one with God or the Universe. This concept, originating from Hermeticism and alchemy, does not promote a return to chaos or uncreation; rather, it pursues a more harmonious, elevated state of being for the individual.

In summary, while all these options explore various aspects of spirituality and philosophy, the Thirteen Divisions of the Nightside in the Qliphothic Tree of Life best embodies the Anti-cosmic occultism's core goal of returning to a state of chaos and uncreation.
