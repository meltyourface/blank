In order to comprehensively understand the symbolic associations and historical influences of Rain dragons in various cultural mythologies, we need to explore the mythic traditions of multiple societies from diverse geographical regions, religious practices, and historical eras, particularly those that have served as fertile grounds for both the development of occultism and a deep-rooted connection to the natural world. 

**Chinese Mythology and Daoism**
One of the most prevalent mythologies in which Rain dragons feature is Chinese mythology. Within this context, Rain dragons, or "Lóng" in Chinese, are often associated with water, weather, and natural phenomena. Dragons in Chinese culture are venerated as symbols of power, wisdom, and good fortune, and were frequently employed as symbols and motifs throughout Chinese history. They are deeply intertwined with Chinese philosophy and spirituality, particularly Daoism. 

Daoism, a traditional Chinese religious and philosophical system, emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao, which is translated as "the Way" – representing the ultimate creative force and the natural flow of the universe. In this system, the symbiosis between the spiritual and the natural predominantly takes shape in the union of the Rain dragon and the natural world. Rain dragons are responsible for the cycle of weather and the distribution of rain, thereby playing a pivotal role in upholding this harmonious relationship between mankind and nature. 

**Mesoamerican Mythology**
In Mesoamerican mythology, Rain dragons also exhibit a strong connection with water and natural forces. The feathered serpent deity, Quetzalcoatl, was associated with wind and rain. Quetzalcoatl was mainly worshipped in Aztec, Mayan, and Toltec religions. The indigenous people used to celebrate the fertility of the earth, and they often made offerings to Quetzalcoatl to appease him and pray for beneficial rainfall.

These offerings often recalibrated the equilibrium between the human and the spiritual realms, a concept that can be associated with occultism. Within Mesoamerican context, occultism encompasses the manipulation of unseen forces to influence worldly outcomes, which, in this case, concerns fostering agricultural abundance through appeasement of their rain deity. 

**Norse Mythology**
Although Norse mythology does not feature Rain dragons explicitly, the presence of dragons, such as Fafnir and Jormungandr, is an essential part of the mythos. Fafnir, a dragon who began as a giant and has a tragic backstory fueled by treachery and deceit, represents destructive elements associated with greed. Meanwhile, Jormungandr, the serpentine sea monster, embodies chaos and the power of natural forces. Norse drakkar (Norse dragon boats) are often seen with their iconic dragonheads, which connects these dragons indirectly with water and sea voyages. In this context, dragons symbolize a troubling aspect of the natural world that eventually leads to Ragnarok – the Norse apocalypse.

In Norse belief, the mystical nature of seidr, a form of Norse magic, can be traced back to the shamanic knowledge of the Sami people and the deep connection with the natural world. This bridge between Norse myths and their magical practice highlights a reciprocal relationship between these mythic Dragons and the power of nature that may lead to occult practices in Norse culture.

**Concluding summary**
In conclusion, Rain dragons in various cultural mythologies – specifically Chinese, Mesoamerican, and Norse mythologies – signify the connection between the natural world and spiritual realms. Their associations with water, fertility, and the power of natural forces give them an essential role in maintaining this complex relationship. Within the context of occultism, Rain dragons can be perceived as catalysts, bridging mankind's intent to control or manage natural resources with spiritual forces. Though separated by geographic location and time, these different mythologies, when understood cohesively, reveal the vital role that Rain dragons play in connecting occult practices with the natural world, ultimately contributing to a broader comprehension of the human need for harmony with the spiritual and the natural environments.
