The Goetia within the Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as the Lemegeton, is a renowned grimoire that lays out detailed instructions to summon and command the 72 demons listed within the text. This in-depth textual analysis will delve into the intricacies of the Goetia, focusing on its rituals, seals, historical connections, and the moral and ethical implications of dabbling in such dark arts.

1. Summoning and commanding the 72 demons:
The methods and rituals for summoning and commanding the 72 demons are built upon a foundation of precise ceremonial magic. These include:

- Preparation, purification, and consecration of the conjurer and their ritual tools.
- Creation and use of ritual circles, triangles of manifestation, and other symbols employed to protect the conjurer and constrain the summoned demon.
- Use of incantations, invocations, and prayers to summon the demon and compel them to act in accordance with the conjurer's desires.

The process follows a strict hierarchical structure that mirrors the demon's position within the infernal hierarchy, acknowledging the names and powers of demons and their ruling spirits or kings.

2. Examination of each demon's seal:
Each of the 72 demons possesses a unique sigil or seal, which serves as a visual representation of their essence, power, and means to summon them. These seals are often intricate and complex, incorporating symbols from various occult practices, such as alchemy, runes, and geomancy. The precise combination of these symbols within a demon's seal is believed to capture the demon's essence and thus facilitate its summoning.

3. Historical connections of the Goetia with other grimoires: 
The Lesser Key of Solomon finds its roots in an extensive grimoire tradition. Key influences include the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum by Johann Weyer, the Heptameron by Peter de Abano, and numerous texts from the Solomonic cycle. Exploring these connections reveals a multitude of cultural, linguistic, and philosophical influences on the Goetia, demonstrating its evolutionary nature in the world of esoteric texts.

4. The role of the conjurer in the League with the Devil:
The practitioner of the Goetia, known as the conjurer, assumes a role of both supplicant and master in their interactions with the demons. The conjurer is required to demonstrate knowledge, discipline, and spiritual strength to successfully summon and command the demons, ensuring that they are protected from the demonic influence and can maintain control of the proceedings.

5. Symbolism behind the practices:
The rituals and symbols within the Goetia contain numerous layers of meaning that reflect concepts central to both demonology and Western esotericism. Some examples include:

- The divine and infernal hierarchies mirror the perceived cosmic order and suggest a need for balance in the pursuit of power and knowledge.
- The magician's use of ritual tools, symbols, and the very act of summoning imply harnessing the inherent forces of the Universe to bend reality according to their will, emphasizing the importance of knowledge and understanding of the natural world.
- Employing sacred names, prayers, and psalms serve as a reminder of the spiritual authority within the rightful sources of power and legitimacy in the universe.

6. Moral and ethical implications:
The pursuit of power and knowledge through the League with the Devil raises significant moral and ethical questions. The conjurer, by summoning and commanding demonic spirits, must confront the personal consequences of utilizing inherently malevolent forces for their gain. Furthermore, the use of higher spiritual authority to compel obedience from demons reflects a potentially manipulative, ego-driven approach toward the attainment of knowledge and power. Ultimately, the conjurer is called to examine their intentions and reconcile those with the potential consequences of their actions, both personally and within the broader spiritual context.

In conclusion, the Lesser Key of Solomon's Goetia offers a complex, multifaceted exploration of ceremonial magic, demonology, and the pursuit of power and knowledge inherent in the League with the Devil. Understanding the intricacies of the rituals, seals, historical connections, and symbolic underpinnings of the text allows for a thorough appreciation of its place within the esoteric landscape and raises thought-provoking questions regarding the ethical implications of seeking such dark alliances.
