excerpt: >
  Design a comprehensive Portent ceremonial magick ritual for invoking the four primary guardian angels of the cardinal directions, ensuring that you include the following key elements: \n\n1. Establishing the sacred space by creating a meticulously drawn magick circle, incorporating the sigils and symbols specific to the guardian angels and the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).\n2. Crafting an elaborate invocation script that addresses each guardian angel individually, incorporating their unique attributes, correspondences, and roles within the protection of the practitioner.\n3. Creating a list of essential ritual tools and materials, such as candles, incense, and crystals, suited to attract the energies of the guardian angels, as well as detailed instructions on how to properly purify and consecrate them.\n4. Incorporating celestial timings and astrological influences in the workings of the ritual, tailoring the performance dates and times to the guardian angels' corresponding planetary bodies and zodiac signs.\n5. Describing how to integrate altered states of consciousness, meditation techniques, or visualizations into the ritual as a means to deepen the connection with the guardian angels and amplify the efficacy of the invocation.\n6. Including safeguards, banishing techniques, or protective measures to ensure the ritual remains focused and contained, preventing the inadvertent summoning of potentially malevolent entities or other unforeseen disturbances.\n7. Providing a method for grounding and centering oneself after the ritual, ensuring that all energies raised during the ceremony are balanced, and expressing gratitude towards the guardian angels for their protection and guidance.

1. **Establishing the Sacred Space**:
Begin by drawing a large circle with a 9-foot diameter on the ground, using chalk or another appropriate material. Within this circle, create a second circle, 3 feet smaller in diameter, leaving a 3-foot wide ring between the two circles.

**Label the four cardinal directions**: North, South, East, and West. **In each of the four quadrants created by these directions, draw the following sigils**:
- North: Guardian Angel Uriel represented by the sigil of Earth and an upright Pentagram.
- South: Guardian Angel Michael represented by the sigil of Fire and an upright Triangle.
- East: Guardian Angel Raphael represented by the sigil of Air and an upright Square.
- West: Guardian Angel Gabriel represented by the sigil of Water and an upright Hexagram.

Within the inner circle, place the practitioner's personal sigil to symbolize their role within the ritual.

2. **Crafting the Invocation Script**:
Begin the ritual by addressing each of the guardian angels, starting with the East and working clockwise. **Speak aloud their individual correspondences and attributes**:

- Guardian Raphael of the East, I call upon your powers of Air, your intellect and healing energy. Grace us with your presence, and let your wisdom guide and protect us.
- Guardian Michael of the South, I call upon your powers of Fire, your strength and courage. Lend us your fierce protection and guard us with your flaming sword.
- Guardian Uriel of the North, I summon your powers of Earth, your stability and abundance. Ground us in your strength and offer us the support we seek.
- Guardian Gabriel of the West, I invoke your powers of Water, your inspiration and intuition. Flow through us with your purifying waters and cleanse our souls.

3. **Essential Ritual Tools and Materials**:
Gather the following items:
- White candles (4): one for each cardinal direction
- Incense: frankincense to attract angelic energies
- Crystals: quartz for amplifying energy and selenite for spiritual connection
- Salt and water for purifying the ritual space

To purify and consecrate the tools, first cleanse the crystals with saltwater and leave them under the moonlight for one night. Cleanse and anoint the candles with rose or lavender oil, moving from the center outward. Light the incense and waft the smoke over each item, saying a prayer of consecration.

4. **Celestial Timings and Astrological Influences**:
Perform the ritual on a Sunday during a waxing moon when the Sun is in Leo, as this celestial configuration strengthens the connection with the guardian angels.

5. **Integration of Altered States of Consciousness**:
Incorporate meditation or visualization techniques, such as envisioning a golden light surrounding the practitioner and merging with the energy of each angel. Channel this energy by raising one's vibrational frequency through deep breathing practices, chanting sacred mantras, or listening to high-frequency music.

6. **Safeguards and Protective Measures**:
To protect the ritual from unwanted energies, begin and end by casting a Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. This practice includes visualizing a flaming blue pentagram at each cardinal direction while reciting specific divine names.

7. **Grounding and Centering**:
After the invocation, thank each guardian angel for their presence. Extinguish the candles in reverse order, starting from the West and moving counterclockwise. Remove the circle and sigils, symbolically breaking the sacred space.

Sit in meditation, envisioning any residual energy being absorbed by the Earth, and express gratitude for the protection and guidance provided by the guardian angels.
