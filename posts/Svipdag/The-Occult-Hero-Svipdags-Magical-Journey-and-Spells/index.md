### III. Svipdag's Journey to Meet His Destined Wife

Following the death of his mother, Gróa, Svipdag embarks on a perilous journey to find his fated wife, the beautiful giantess Menglöð, who is a symbol of earthly and spiritual abundance.

These spells enable Svipdag to receive guidance and protection from his mother's spirit, empowering him both physically and spiritually for the trials he will face.

Upon reaching Asgard, the divine realm where Menglöð resides, Svipdag faces his most daunting challenge yet, the guardian Fjölsvith. In their exchange, known as the Fjölsvinnsmál, Svipdag must flex his occult knowledge and understanding of runes to bypass the guardian and secure entrance into Menglöð's abode.
