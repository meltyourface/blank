To utilize Muhurta astrology techniques to ascertain the most auspicious moments for significant life events, we need to consider the factors mentioned, such as the positions of the Grahas (planets) and Nakshatras (lunar mansions).

Let us start with the first example - marriage.

1. Marriage:

- Ascendant: The Ascendant should be strong, and Venus should be well placed in the marriage horoscope.
- Moon: The Moon should be waxing, not waning, and should be free from affliction.
- Nakshatras: Rohini, Magha, Uttaraphalguni, Uttarasadha, and Uttara-Bhadra are the most auspicious Nakshatras for marriage.
- Day: Friday and Wednesday are considered auspicious for weddings.

Based on these criteria, it's important to analyze the position of the planets and the Nakshatras for specific dates during the marriage season, and select the best Muhurta to ensure the success of the union.

2. Career Advancements:

- Ascendant: It should be strong and free from any malefic influences.
- Jupiter: As the natural significator of wisdom and knowledge, Jupiter should be well placed.
- Sun: The Sun, which represents authority and career, should be strong.
- Mercury: This planet represents communication and intellect, making it important for career advancements.
- Nakshatras: Hasta, Pushya, and Abhijit are considered auspicious for career-related activities.

An auspicious Muhurta for career advancements can be calculated by analyzing the energies of these planets and Nakshatras in relation to the birth chart of the individual.

3. Property Purchases:

- Ascendant: A strong Ascendant is crucial for a favorable outcome in property matters.
- Fourth House: Represents property matters, should be free from afflictions.
- Venus: The planet of luxury and comforts should be well placed.
- Nakshatras: Anuradha, Sravana, and Revati are considered auspicious for property-related activities.

By studying the interplay between the relevant Grahas and Nakshatras during different days, an ideal Muhurta for property purchases can be established.

In conclusion, applying Muhurta astrology techniques requires analysis of the favorable positions of relevant Grahas and Nakshatras while considering the specific significant life event. By doing so, the ideal Muhurta that favors the prosperity and success of each event can be determined.
