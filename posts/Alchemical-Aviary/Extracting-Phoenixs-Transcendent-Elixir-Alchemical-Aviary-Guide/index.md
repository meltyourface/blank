  Detail the intricate step-by-step process for safely extracting the ethereal essence from a Phoenix's fire-plume feathers, followed by meticulously blending it with alchemical mercury, in order to create a transcendent compound exhibiting both rejuvenating and metamorphic properties in the realm of the Alchemical Aviary.
---**Step 1**: Preparation
Before beginning the extraction process, make sure to have a well-ventilated workspace, as the ethereal essence from a Phoenix's fire-plume feathers can be quite potent. Don appropriate protective gear (gloves, goggles, and a fire-resistant apron).
**Step 2**: Acquire fire-plume feathers
It's essential to locate a Phoenix in the Alchemical Aviary, preferably one that has recently undergone the rebirth process. Approach the Phoenix cautiously, as they are powerful, proud creatures. With respect, collect a few fire-plume feathers that have been naturally shed during its rebirth.
**Step 3**: Ready the receiving vessel
Choose a hermetically sealed flask made of heat-resistant glass to accommodate and protect the essence. Ensuring the flask is clean, prepare a funnel and a filter (such as a filtrum simplex) to prevent any solid impurities from entering the flask during extraction.
**Step 4**: Ethereal essence extraction
Place the fire-plume feathers into a retort, which has been fixed with a condenser and connected to the receiving flask prepared earlier. Gently heat the retort using a sand bath; avoid direct flame as it may damage the essence. As the temperature rises, the ethereal essence will vaporize and move through the condenser, condensing back into a liquid and filtering through into the flask.
**Step 5**: Prepare the alchemical mercury
Alchemical mercury is a highly reactive compound, so prepare it in a different workspace to avoid cross-contamination. Wear appropriate protective gear, including a mask, to prevent respiratory exposure. Combine equal parts cinnabar ore with distilled vinegar in a flask. Slowly heat the mixture using a water bath and collect the distilled vapors, which contain the alchemical mercury.
**Step 6**: Purify the extracted essence
Let the extracted ethereal essence rest for a day to allow any impurities to settle at the bottom. Decant the purified essence into a clean flask, discarding any residue.
**Step 7**: Blend and imbue the essence with alchemical mercury
In a new flask, combine the purified ethereal essence with equal parts alchemical mercury. Gently warm the mixture using a water bath, stirring occasionally with a glass stirrer. As the two components interact, they will produce a vibrant, iridescent compound.
**Step 8**: Conclude the process
Allow the transcendent compound to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, seal the flask and label it with the date and contents. Store the compound in a dark, cool location.

This transcendent compound contains both rejuvenating and metamorphic properties, making it an invaluable elixir in the realm of Alchemical Aviary. When employed wisely, it can catalyze wondrous transformations, imbuing the imbiber with a fresh surge of vitality and the ability to undergo metamorphosis akin to the legendary Phoenix.
