Selected passage from Liber DCLXXI vel Pyramidos: 

"Thrash out the Chaff of the Wheat, that the Flail may learn from the Wheel; refine the spirit from the earth, till the fixed become volatile, and the volatile become fixed, that the Salt may be seasoned with Salt!"

**Interpretation**:

This passage from Liber DCLXXI vel Pyramidos signifies the essential process of purification and transformation both within the individual practitioner and the larger cosmos.

The imagery of "thrash out the chaff of the wheat" evokes the idea of separating what is desirable from undesirable, symbolizing a process of self-purification in which the practitioner isolates their highest, most essential spiritual nature from the lesser, earthly aspects of their being. The process of refinement, through which "the spirit from the earth" is purified, mirrors the alchemical process of separating the fixed from the volatile components of a substance.

This alchemical language represents the inner transformation that the aspirant undergoes, ultimately achieving a union of the microcosm (individual) with the macrocosm (divine/cosmic). In this context, "till the fixed become volatile, and the volatile become fixed" reflects the transcendent state in which opposites are transcended, and the practitioner experiences the true divine nature of reality, unclouded by illusion.

The line "that the Salt may be seasoned with Salt!" further emphasizes the importance of this internal alchemy, as the "Salt" is understood to represent the physical body, the mind, and the individual spirit. The use of Salt as a symbol touches upon the concept of preservation and purification, as well as wholeness and unity.

The connection between this passage and the larger themes of Liber DCLXXI vel Pyramidos is exemplified in the practice of ritual ascent, which serves as a vehicle for the esoteric experience of cosmic unity and self-mastery. The passage is an invocation of transformation requiring the adherent to break free from the limitations of the material realm, refining themselves into a being that can experience the absolute.

In relation to complementary texts, such as The Vision and the Voice or the Book of Lies, this passage resonates with the motif of the individual's journey through the subtle realms of consciousness and the dissolution of ego-identity. Crowley's exploration of the Aethyrs in The Vision and the Voice illustrates the process of ascending through various spiritual planes, unveiling deeper layers of hidden wisdom and cosmic connection.

In conclusion, the selected passage from Liber DCLXXI vel Pyramidos communicates the profound process of purification and transformation integral to the practitioner's spiritual development. It beautifully encapsulates the essence of esoteric practice, in which the aspirant transcends the mundane and discovers their true divine nature. Drawing from various alchemical symbols and ideas, it connects to broader themes within the work and offers a unique and evocative perspective on the transcendent mysteries of human potential and cosmic unity.
