In eldritch twilight, the archangels congregate,
Seven shadows, draped in mystery and fate,
Each bearing secrets and divine intent,
Where light and darkness subtly blend and bend.

### I. Michael, warrior of celestial fire,
Swift defender and destroyer dire,
Through mists of fate, your flaming sword,
The lion's heart, the serpent's cord.

### II. Gabriel, somber silent guardian,
Guarding secrets and the key to wisdom,
With moonlit torch, divining murky thoughts,
Enshrouded master of the words untaught.

### III. Raphael, healer of our hearts' lament,
Intertwined with despair, true faith unbent,
In light, restoring hope to darkest depths,
With shadows' touch, unleashing silent deaths.

### IV. Uriel, keeper of the ancient scrolls,
A cryptic gaze on paths of light and woes,
The essence of balance, both to and fro,
From Anubis' scales, the judgment flows.

### V. Chamuel, unraveling the tangled heart,
To mend what's split and unite what's barred,
In shadows, evoking covetous desire,
Consuming, fevered yearning transpire.

### VI. Jophiel, illuminator of the sacred well,
Awaking dormant wisdom, untold tales to tell,
In murk, awakening the darkest dreams,
Where sanity and madness intertwine and scream.

### VII. Zadkiel, keeper of mercy and forgiveness,
The guardian who holds the gates of emptiness,
Yet, through shadows, plies the scythe of vengeance,
Guiding souls to paths of swift requital hence.

In eldritch twilight, the archangels disperse,
To worlds unseen and realms of secret verse,
Bound by cryptic powers and ancient ties,
Mere shadows, until the twilight rises.
