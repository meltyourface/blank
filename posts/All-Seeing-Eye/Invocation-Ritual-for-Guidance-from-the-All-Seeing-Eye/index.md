## Title: The Ritual of the All-Seeing Eye's Guidance and Wisdom

**Objective**: To invoke the guidance and wisdom of the All-Seeing Eye during times of personal tribulation and seeking enlightenment.

**Preparation**:

1. **Gather the ceremonial objects**:
   a. A pentagram inscribed in a circle (drawn on parchment or etched on a metal disc)
   b. A white candle (representing purity)
   c. A black candle (representing protection)
   d. A purple candle (representing wisdom)
   e. A small dish of salt
   f. A chalice or cup filled with pure water
   g. A censer with burning incense (preferably frankincense)
   h. A ritual dagger or athame
   i. A bell
   j. A comfortable seat or meditation cushion

2. **Arrange the sacred space**:
   a. Choose a quiet, calm, and comfortable location.
   b. Position the three candles on the points of a triangle, with the white candle at the top (north), the black candle at the lower right (south-west), and the purple candle at the lower left (south-east).
   c. Place the pentagram inside the triangle, with the circle's edge touching the candles.
   d. Sprinkle salt around the circle to create a boundary.
   e. Position the chalice and censer within the circle on either side of the pentagram.
   f. Place the ritual dagger or athame on the pentagram.
   g. Set up the meditation seat or cushion in the center of the circle.

The Ritual:

1. **Begin by lighting the candles in the following order**: white candle, black candle, and purple candle.

2. Ring the bell three times to mark the beginning of the ritual, calling on the elements of earth, air, fire, and water.

3. **Invoke the protection and guidance of the All-Seeing Eye**:
   a. **Recite the incantation**: "I call upon the ancient powers of the All-Seeing Eye. Grant me your protection and guidance during this time of tribulation."

4. Breathe deeply and enter a meditative state, visualizing the All-Seeing Eye within your mind's eye, emanating its powerful and wise light.

5. In this state, present your troubles, fears, and uncertainties to the All-Seeing Eye, asking for wisdom and guidance.

6. Bring the dagger or athame to your forehead and say, "With this symbol, I mark my connection to the All-Seeing Eye's infinite wisdom and eternal guidance."

7. Draw a symbol of the Eye on the parchment or metal disc, using the dagger or athame to etch it.

8. Place the symbol on the ground, and stand on it, focusing your energy on absorbing the wisdom and guidance of the All-Seeing Eye.

9. After several moments of quiet reflection, ring the bell three times to signal the end of the ritual.

10. Extinguish the candles in reverse order (purple, black, and white), thanking the All-Seeing Eye for its wisdom and guidance.

11. Safely dispose of any remains of the ritual, and store the ceremonial objects in sacred spaces.
