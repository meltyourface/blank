Preparatory Steps:

1. **Choose a time and location**: Select a secluded space where you can perform the ritual, preferably during a new moon or full moon, as these significant lunar phases possess powerful energies. This space could be indoors or outdoors, but it should be private and provide a sense of tranquility.

2. **Cleanse the area**: Thoroughly clean the chosen space and arrange the materials you will use. You may smudge the area with sage or another cleansing herb to purify the environment and establish a clean, protective energy.

3. **Gather materials**: Carefully gather the required materials for the ritual. Each item contributes to the consecration of the athame and integration of the All-Seeing Eye energy.

Materials:

- Athame: The focal point of the ritual, an athame is a double-edged ceremonial dagger used for directing energies in magical workings.
- Eye of Providence symbol: The All-Seeing Eye, represented by a triangle surrounding an eye, should be inscribed on a piece of paper or crafted object.
- Three white pillar candles: Symbolizing purity, knowledge, and divine connection.
- Black or deep purple altar cloth: The colors represent the mysteries of the universe and the occult.
- Quartz crystal: Representing clarity, focus, and amplification of energy.
- Amethyst crystal: For enhancing intuition and spiritual connections.
- Essential oils: Frankincense and Myrrh, known for purification and spiritual properties.
- Bowl of purified water: To purify the athame during the ritual.
- Small dish of sea salt: A symbol of protection and cleansing.
- Incense: Choose a blend that resonates with you, such as sandalwood or patchouli, to set the ritual atmosphere and further cleanse the area.

Ritual:

1. **Prepare the space**: Place the black or deep purple altar cloth on a table or other surface, and arrange the candles in a triangle formation. Put the Eye of Providence symbol in the center, surrounded by the crystals, bowl of water, and dish of salt.

2. **Light the incense and candles**: Begin by lighting the incense to create a calming and sacred atmosphere. Then, light each candle while silently invoking the divine, the ethereal forces, and the All-Seeing Eye to assist you in the consecration of the athame.

3. **Consecrate the athame**: Hold the athame above the bowl of water. Carefully drop three drops of Frankincense essential oil into the water, then, three drops of Myrrh. Stir the water with your fingers, and then sprinkle some water onto the athame. **Gently cleanse it and pronounce the following incantation**:

"By the powers of the All-Seeing Eye, I consecrate this athame. May it serve as a reflection of divine wisdom and illumination, a vessel for the unseen forces. In unity with the eternal occult mysteries, may it extend my reach beyond the veil."

4. **Charge the athame with the crystals**: Place the athame on the Eye of Providence symbol, positioning the quartz crystal on one side and the amethyst crystal on the other. Meditate on your intentions for the athame, envisioning its powers aligned with the forces of the esoteric, and occult realms.

5. **Close the ritual**: Thank the divine, the ethereal forces, and the All-Seeing Eye for their assistance in the consecration of the athame. Blow out the candles and allow the incense to burn out. Leave the athame on the Eye of Providence symbol overnight to absorb the energies.

6. **Store the athame**: Once the ritual is complete, safely store your newly consecrated athame in a dedicated space or container to preserve its energies and connection to the All-Seeing Eye and the esoteric realms.

Remember that the ritual's success is reliant on your intention, focus, and mastery of the All-Seeing Eye's energies in conjunction with the various elements assembled to consecrate your athame.
