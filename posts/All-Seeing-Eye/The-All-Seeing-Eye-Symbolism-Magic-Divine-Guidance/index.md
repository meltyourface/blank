Introduction

The All-Seeing Eye, also known as the Eye of Providence or the Eye of Horus, is an ancient and powerful symbol that has endured throughout history.

This chapter aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the esoteric symbolism, mystical properties, and practical applications of the All-Seeing Eye in both personal and ceremonial magic.
