For this task, I've chosen to examine the "Zohar," a pivotal text within the Kabbalah tradition. The Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism that seeks to understand the nature of divinity and the cosmos and is deeply rooted in the Initiatic tradition.

The "Zohar" is a collection of mystical commentaries and interpretations on the Hebrew Bible, primarily focused on the first five books known as the Torah. It is written in Aramaic, and is attributed to the 13th-century Spanish-Jewish mystic Rabbi Moses de Leon. However, oral traditions of the Zoharic teachings can be traced back further to the 2nd-century Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai.

Coded Allusions and Esoteric Symbolism:

1. **The Sefirot**: One of the foundational concepts illuminated within the Zohar is the idea of the Sefirot, or the Ten Emanations of Divine Energy. These emanations represent different aspects of God's attributes and are symbolically depicted as spheres on the Tree of Life. The Sefirot are interconnected, reflecting the dynamic relationship between the infinite and the finite realms.

2. **The Ein Sof**: The Zohar describes the unknowable and limitless essence of God as Ein Sof, which translates to "without end" or "infinite." Though incomprehensible to the human intellect and entirely transcendent, the Ein Sof emanates its divine energy through the Sefirot, creating and sustaining all that exists.

3. **The Shekhinah**: The Zohar's exploration of divine gender as part of the Sefirot alludes to the concept of the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God. Often considered the tenth Sefirah, the Shekhinah represents the divine presence in the world and is at times associated with the Sabbath and the divine spirit that rests upon Israel.

Historical, Cultural, and Mystical Contexts:

1. **The Transmission of Oral Teachings**: The Zohar emerged from a long-standing oral tradition of Jewish mysticism before being compiled in written form. Considering this oral history, it is essential to understand the fluidity and experiential nature of the Zohar's teachings, which have been influenced by generations of spiritual practitioners.

2. **Medieval Jewish Mysticism**: The Zohar developed within the context of medieval Jewish mysticism, which sought to personalize and deepen Jewish religious practice beyond the strict halakhic commandments. These practices developed alongside and sometimes in dialogue with Christian and Islamic mystical currents.

3. **Neoplatonic Influence**: The philosophies of Neoplatonism, particularly the works of Plotinus, influenced the way the author of the Zohar conceived of the emanations of the divine. The concept of the emanations bridges the gap between the transcendent and the immanent, allowing for a unification of the individual and the divine in the process of mystical ascent.

Through an examination of the Zohar's esoteric symbolism, coded allusions, and historical, cultural, and mystical contexts, its profound hidden meanings and spiritual insights are gradually unveiled. These teachings challenge the reader to delve deeper into their understanding of the divine and their relationship with the infinite source of creation.
