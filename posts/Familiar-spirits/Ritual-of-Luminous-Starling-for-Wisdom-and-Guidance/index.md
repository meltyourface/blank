## Summoning Rite of the Familiar Spirit of the Luminous Starling

Familiar Spirit: The Luminous Starling (Lat. Lumen Stellaria), a celestial bird spirit renowned for its wisdom and guidance in all manners of learning, creativity, and communication. Its visual appearance is that of a shining, iridescent starling of a shimmering indigo color.

Symbolic Elements:
1. The stylized bird's nest - represents the desired collaboration between practitioner and spirit.
2. The symbol of Mercury - associated with communication, learning, and perception.
3. A seven-pointed star - denotes the spirit's celestial origins and serves as the summoning sigil.

**Location**: An ancient forest, at the center of a circular clearing with seven evenly-spaced trees where birds are known to inhabit. The location should be infused with the spirit of nature, untamed and rich in ambient energy.

Tools and Materials:
1. A reliable compass - for proper alignment of the ritual space.
2. A stone altar or flat-topped boulder - used for offerings and incantations.
3. Chalk or natural pigments - to draw the seven-pointed summoning sigil.
4. Incense (frankincense and myrrh) - to cleanse the ritual space.
5. An offering plate/tray - to present offerings to the Luminous Starling.
6. A silver chalice filled with spring water - a symbol of purity for the spirit.
7. A polished mirror or scrying surface - to communicate with the Luminous Starling.

Timing and Astrological Conditions: The rite must be performed on a clear, moonless night when the planet Mercury is visible and rising in the eastern sky. Ideally, Mercury should be in conjunction or sextile aspect with another celestial body to enhance the communicative aspects of the ritual.

**Incantations**:

Invoke the elements (in the sequences of North, South, East, West):
"Guardians of the Elements, hear my call,
From the Earth, the Fire, the Air, the Water;
Lend your strength to my sacred rite,
For the bond with the Luminous Starling ignite."

Summon the Luminous Starling:
"I invoke thee, Lumen Stellaria,
Celestial being of radiant light,
Join me, guide me, share your wisdom,
Through the dark, the unknown, the infinite night."

**Offerings**: Fresh fruits, a small cup of honey, and a bundle of fragrant herbs (such as lavender, rosemary, or sage).

**Safeguards**:
1. Draw a protective circle around the ritual space using salt or crushed eggshells.
2. Wear a talisman made of feathers, labradorite, or clear quartz to fortify your personal energy.
3. Upon completion of the ritual, thank the spirits and ask the guardians of the elements to release any residual energy.

Ritual Steps:

1. Cleanse the ritual space by smudging with incense.
2. Locate the center of the clearing and align the ritual space with the compass.
3. Place the altar in the center of the clearing.
4. Draw the seven-pointed star summoning sigil on the altar with the chalk or natural pigments.
5. Arrange the offering plate, chalice of water, and mirror on the altar.
6. Stand at the altar, facing the eastern sky.
7. Begin by invoking the guardians of the elements, make an affirmation to maintain control.
8. Call upon the Luminous Starling using the incantation.
9. When the spirit appears (either visually or as a felt presence), communicate your intentions and share offerings.
10. Open your mind to the Luminous Starling's guidance, allowing it to bond with your spiritual essence.
11. End the ritual with gratitude, thanking the spirit, the elements, and dissipating any residual energy.
12. Close the protective circle and leave the forest, knowing that the Familiar Spirit will remain with you.
