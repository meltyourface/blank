excerpt: > 
  Craft a meticulous incantation, imbued with the ancient knowledge of Communion with the Beloved, to summon benevolent forces into a consecrated sanctuary for the purpose of enhancing one's spiritual connection and fostering a profound union with the divine. Incorporate intricate symbolism, including the sacred geometry of the Seal of Solomon and the ethereal presence of angelic guardians, to further amplify the potency and allure of the spiritual energies beckoned. As an exemplar, invoke the illuminating presence of Archangel Michael to protect and guide the supplicants as they journey through the sacred realms, transcending the boundaries of this plane and embracing the boundless love of the Beloved.

I call forth the divine presence of the universe,
Through the cosmic patterns we shall converse,
Within this sacred sanctuary encircled in purity,
May our hearts unite with divine love and surety.

By the Seal of Solomon, an ancient symbol of Oneness,
Drawn in harmony and balance, our mighty compass,
A symbol of Alchemy, weaving spirit and flesh,
In this circle of power, our desires shall enmesh.

In the presence of angelic guardians, our souls profess,
Ethereal guides, bring us the light and solace we request,
Lead our minds into the uncharted realms and elevations,
Unveil the veil and grant us divine revelations.

I invoke the illuminating fire of Archangel Michael,
Protector and guide, your beacon of truth, perpetual,
Defend our course through the cosmic domain, exemplary,
Purify our connection to the eternal source, intrepidly.

Seven concentric circles we inscribe upon the sacred ground,
Each evolving into the next, to higher wisdom we are bound,
Within this space, a conduit to our divine intention,
With focused will, we call upon celestial ascension.

Gathered in the name of the Beloved, we pray,
To commune with divine love, empower us today,
The ethereal forces of the cosmos we entreat,
Benevolent spirits, join us in this spiritual retreat.

By this incantation, meticulously crafted with reverence,
Our profound union with the divine, we cherish and enhance,
As above, so below, and within our souls, we pierce,
The boundaries of this plane, in love, we immerse.
