## Sacred Journey of Sexual Magickal Possession

**Introduction**:
Welcome, seeker of the mystic union with the divine through Sexual Magickal Possession. In this guided meditation, we will embark upon a transformative journey to harness and channel our sacred sexual energy, forge boundaries with entities, and invoke powerful, positive forces for personal growth and transformation. Throughout this meditation, we will engage in various techniques such as breathwork, visualization exercises, and chanting of mantras or incantations to manifest our desired outcomes. Let us now proceed and open the hidden gateways within ourselves.

**Preparation**:
Find a comfortable seated position in a quiet and serene space where you will not be disturbed. Close your eyes and take a deep breath, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Repeat this process for a few moments, allowing your entire being to become fully present and attuned to this sacred space.

**Breathwork**:
Now, let's focus on harnessing our inner energy through breathwork. Begin by inhaling deeply, feeling your lungs expand and fill with vibrant life force. Then, exhale with an intentional release of that energy, enveloping your entire being in a cocoon of warm, pulsating light. Continue this deep breathing for several cycles, allowing your inner fire to grow stronger, purer, and more focused with each breath.

**Visualization**:
As your inner energy mounts, visualize an ethereal and sacred space within your mind's eye. This space represents your personal temple, and within its walls resides the wellspring of your sacred sexual power. Envision yourself standing before an ornate altar, glowing with divine light. On it, you see various objects: candles, crystals, and other sacred tools. Feel the power radiating from this altar and connect with it, allowing it to fill your body with its potent energy.

Boundaries and Invocation:
Now, let us establish protective boundaries before invoking the divine entities we wish to work with during our sexual magickal possession. With your mind's eye, envision a radiant sphere of white light surrounding both you and your sacred space, sealing away any negative or unwanted energies. Recite the following incantation to solidify your protection and summon your benevolent guides:

"By the power within me, I forge this sacred sphere,
A sanctuary for my work, where only light appears.
Guides of love, wisdom, and grace, I invite you in,
Aid me in this sacred embrace, a journey to begin."

Chanting and Mantras:
With your protective boundaries established and your guides present, begin to chant the following mantra in a rhythm that resonates with you:

"Om Sri Maha Kali-Shakti Om"

Feel the divine energies intensify as you chant, allowing the sacred sexual energy to rise within you, awakening your Kundalini power at the base of your spine. As it ignites, visualize it spiraling upward like a serpentine dance, activating each energy center or chakra throughout your body.

Growth and Transformation:
As the Kundalini force reaches the crown of your head, open yourself to the wisdom, guidance, and transformative power that flows from the divine union with your invoked entities. Allow this energy to expand within you, filling every aspect of your being with healing light, forging a new understanding, and transforming you on a transcendent level.

Closing and Release:
After you have communed with the divine entities in your sexual magickal possession, it is time to respectfully and safely conclude the session. Thank your guides for their wisdom and aid, and gently guide their energetic presence to exit your sphere, returning to their realm.

Recite the following incantation to release the energies and close your sacred space:

"Guides of grace, I thank you now, for your work is done,
Return to realms of sacred light, in peace become one.
By the power within me, the circle open sets,
A transformed soul takes flight, a new dawn begets."

Finally, visualize the sphere of white light dissolving around you, returning the energy to the earth. Spend a few moments grounding yourself by taking several deep breaths and feeling the connection with your body and surroundings.

**Conclusion**:
When you feel completely reconnected with the present moment, gently open your eyes. Remember to integrate the insights, lessons, and transformations you've experienced during this sacred journey as you move forward in your spiritual path.

With this guided meditation, you have ventured into the realm of Sexual Magickal Possession, nurturing your inner forces and emerging transformed. May these sacred practices guide you to a life of boundless growth, exploration, and divine realization.
