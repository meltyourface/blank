In order to fully address this knowledge challenge, we will go through the individual components contributing to the concept of Sexual Magickal Possession and then merge these understandings to form a holistic perspective on invoking a higher entity or consciousness. Finally, we will delve into the potential ethical implications surrounding the use of such practices for personal spiritual advancement.

1. The Chakra System: The chakra system is comprised of seven major energy centers that run along the human spine, from the base to the crown. Each chakra has its own attributes, such as frequency, color, and associations with various elements of human life like emotions, body parts, and states of consciousness. When all chakras are in harmony, it creates a flow of balanced energy, which is essential for spiritual advancement. In the context of Sexual Magickal Possession, this balance of energy is believed to create a suitable vessel for invoking higher entities or consciousness.

2. Subtle Energy Dynamics: The understanding of subtle energy dynamics pertains to the intricate connections and interactions of different energetic fields within and around a person. These could include nadis (energy meridians), the aura (electromagnetic field surrounding the body), and energetic polarity. Cultivating an understanding of these dynamics allows an individual to manipulate, balance, and harness their energy for higher vibrational purposes. In Sexual Magickal Possession, this understanding of subtle energies can enable a practitioner to channel and direct energy towards the intention of invoking a higher entity or consciousness.

3. Ego Dissolution: Ego dissolution refers to the process of transcending the personal identity or 'self', enabling one to experience a state of oneness with the universe. In many spiritual traditions, the dissolution of ego is considered a necessary step towards spiritual growth. In the context of Sexual Magickal Possession, this state of unity consciousness might be essential for connecting with and embodying a higher entity or divine consciousness.

Now, to synthesize these concepts: When a practitioner engages in Sexual Magickal Possession, the balancing of the chakra system primes their energy for invocation, the understanding of subtle energy dynamics allows them to channel and direct their energy, and the state of ego dissolution opens them up to the experience of unity with the higher entity or consciousness being invoked.

However, there are potential ethical implications surrounding the use of these practices for personal spiritual advancement. Engaging in Sexual Magickal Possession can invite various dilemmas such as the risk of inappropriate usage of power, self-gratification motives, or potential harm to other individuals or entities involved, whether directly or indirectly. Therefore, practitioners should be cautious when using these techniques and ensure that their intentions originate from a place of purity, compassion, and ethical responsibility.

In conclusion, the amalgamation of the chakra system, the understanding of subtle energy dynamics, and the concept of ego dissolution contribute to the process of invoking a higher entity or consciousness in the context of Sexual Magickal Possession by creating a balanced energetic vessel, allowing one to manipulate energy for higher vibrational purposes, and enabling the individual to transcend personal limits to experience unity with the divine. However, the ethical implications surrounding the use of such practices highlight the need for practitioners to approach these techniques with a high level of integrity and responsibility, ensuring the pursuit of spiritual advancement is rooted in compassion and understanding.
