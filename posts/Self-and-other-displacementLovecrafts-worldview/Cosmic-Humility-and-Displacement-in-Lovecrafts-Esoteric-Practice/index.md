To address this knowledge challenge, I'll first give an overview of Lovecraft's worldview and the concept of self and other displacement, followed by a detailed explanation of the two aspects that best manifest this concept. Finally, I'll describe how initiates can integrate these aspects within their own esoteric practice.

Lovecraft's Worldview and Self and Other Displacement:

H.P. Lovecraft was an American horror writer who pioneered the genre of cosmic horror. His works often explored themes of the unknown, otherworldly beings, and the insignificance of humanity in the grand scheme of the cosmos. Lovecraft's worldview encompasses the sense that humans are mere specks in the vast universe, and the forces that govern our existence are not only indifferent to our well-being but also beyond our comprehension.

Self and other displacement is a concept closely related to Lovecraft's worldview. It revolves around the idea that our own existence and the world we perceive are not as stable or established as we might believe. In other words, the boundaries between ourselves and external entities can be blurred, creating a sense of disorientation and a feeling that we are lost in an incomprehensible reality.

Two Aspects of Lovecraft's Worldview Manifesting Self and Other Displacement:

1. Encounter with Cosmic Entities:
One prominent feature of Lovecraft's works is the introduction of powerful, ancient cosmic beings that exist outside of human understanding. These entities, such as Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth, often create a sense of displacement in the characters who encounter them. Beings of immeasurable power and knowledge, they challenge the very foundations of human existence.

When humans engage with these cosmic entities, they may experience self and other displacement as they realize that their place in the universe is not as significant as they once thought. The immense power and knowledge of these beings make the human ego feel minuscule, thus setting the stage for individuals to question their identity and their very existence.

2. The Indifference of the Cosmos:
Another aspect of Lovecraft's worldview that manifests self and other displacement is the notion that the universe is indifferent to our lives and struggles. Lovecraft emphasized that human existence is a mere blip in the cosmic timeline, and the vast universe operates without any regard to our well-being.

This idea can foster a sense of displacement, as it forces individuals to question their purpose, meaning, and value within a universe that doesn't care about their existence. By recognizing that the cosmos operate independently of our needs and desires, we may experience a simultaneous sense of powerlessness and an awakening to the arbitrary nature of our constructed world.

Integrating Concepts into Esoteric Practice:

As initiates delve into Lovecraft's worldview and embrace the concepts of self and other displacement, they can incorporate them into their esoteric practice by following these recommendations:

1. Embracing Humility:
An essential step in integrating these concepts is to adopt an attitude of humility. Initiates should acknowledge the limits of human understanding and be willing to accept their insignificance in cosmic context. This approach can lead to a greater connection with and respect for the mysterious forces in the universe, as well as a deeper awareness of one's own finite nature.

2. Expanding Consciousness:
Working to expand one's consciousness is another way initiates can integrate self and other displacement into their practice. This may involve meditation, astral projection, or other practices that help them transcend the boundaries of their identity and explore the intangible realms beyond their physical existence. By doing so, initiates can begin to grasp the scope of the vast cosmos and their place within it.

In conclusion, the concept of self and other displacement is notably manifested in Lovecraft's worldview through the encounter with cosmic entities and the indifference of the cosmos itself. To integrate these concepts into their esoteric practice, initiates must embrace humility and expand their consciousness to transcend the confines of their identity and gain a deeper understanding of their place within the unfeeling universe. By doing so, they can open themselves up to a more profound connection with the unseen forces governing our existence and develop a new perspective on the nature of reality.
