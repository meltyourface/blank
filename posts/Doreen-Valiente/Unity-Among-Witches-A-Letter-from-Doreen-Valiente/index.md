Dear fellow Witches,

As I look upon both the changes and continuities that have taken place since my time on this Earth, I am heartened by the ever-growing interest and expansion of the Craft. My enduring works remind me that it is our responsibility to support one another through the ongoing evolution of our shared passionâ€”Witchcraft. I write this letter from my heart to yours, seeking to offer guidance and perspective on the path we all walk together.

One of the most evident challenges that practitioners of the Craft face today is the constant influx of new information, alongside commercialization and the sensationalized portrayal of witchcraft. As Witches, it is essential that we recognize this disparity and strive to maintain the essence of traditional witchcraft while adjusting to the modern world. As the Craft has always been adaptable, we must also learn to incorporate new practices and methods where they serve us best, honoring the teachings of our ancestors and melding them with modern wisdom.

There is great beauty in the diverse paths of witchcraft, and we must remember to appreciate and respect these differences, as they contribute to the richness and depth of our collective knowledge. Sectarian beliefs can only hold us back; instead, we must adopt an inclusive approach, uniting us as practitioners and fostering bonds of harmony amongst us all. It is through this unity that the ever-burning Fire of the Craft will continue to illuminate the path for generations to come.

In these times, it is easier than ever for misconceptions about witchcraft to run rampant. Common misunderstandings paint our sacred practices as sinister or frivolous, which threatens our image and the continued growth and transmission of the Craft. To overcome these challenges, practitioners must remain steadfast in their commitment to honoring the Craft's true nature: a force built upon wisdom, love, and healing. By embodying these values with integrity, our actions will serve as testimonials, helping to dispel misunderstandings and establish witchcraft as a respected and honored practice.

As guardians of this ancient and powerful wisdom, we must hold ourselves accountable for its preservation, its evolution, and its accurate portrayal. Inspiration and guidance can be found within the words of our predecessors, but we are also the innovators and creators of modern Witchcraft. Let us forge a future where we respect one another's unique paths, encourage understanding, promote unity, and share in our love of the Old Ways.

United in our Crafts and our hearts, we shall triumph over challenges and welcome new horizons.

Blessed be,

Doreen Valiente
