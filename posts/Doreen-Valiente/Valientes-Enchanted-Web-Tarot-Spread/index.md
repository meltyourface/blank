  Here is a step-by-step guide to interpreting the cards in the context of Valiente's occult teachings:
  
  Card 1: The Beacon - The Essence of the Situation
  This card represents the central issue or situation in question. It is the "spark" or "call" that has initiated the reading and can shed light on the underlying theme or energies at play. Reflect on the primary ideas found in Valiente's works, such as the relationship between humans and nature, personal empowerment, and witchcraft as a spiritual practice.
  
  Cards 2 and 3: The Pillars - Values and Beliefs Affecting the Situation
  These cards symbolize the core values and beliefs that are shaping your situation. Consider their influence in shaping your perceptions, choices, and actions. Draw upon Valiente's exploration of the history and lore of witchcraft to gain insight into how these beliefs impact your experience.
  
  Cards 4, 6, and 4 mirrored: The Triple Goddess - The Steps Towards Resolution
  These three cards represent the aspects of the Triple Goddess: Maiden (card 4), Mother (card 6), and Crone (card 4 mirrored). Each card provides guidance on the necessary steps or growth needed to address the situation at hand, highlighting the wisdom found within each aspect of the Divine Feminine as presented in Valiente's work.
  
  Cards 5 and 5 mirrored: The Horned God - Energies to Embrace and Release
  These cards symbolize the duality of the Horned God archetype explored in Valiente's books. Card 5 represents energies or principles to embrace, such as courage, action, or protection, while card 5 mirrored represents energies to release, such as fear, hesitation, or aggression.
  
  Cards 10, 11, and 12: The Sacred Circle - The Path Forward
  These cards represent the path forward and the outcome that arises from your choices and actions. They depict a harmonious resolution to the situation while considering the interconnected web of existence and the influences of the elements, as emphasized in Valiente's teachings.
  
  In conclusion, the Valiente's Enchanted Web tarot spread provides an in-depth and complex method for exploring and interpreting a situation through the lens of Doreen Valiente's occult teachings and perspectives. Its unique combination of layout patterns and emphasis on key themes ensures a meaningful and insightful experience for both the reader and the querent.
