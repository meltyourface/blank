In accordance with the mystical knowledge found within the Pseudo-Agrippan Texts and the complexities of the planetary hours system, I present an advanced sigil that harmoniously incorporates planetary symbols and astrological glyphs. The design follows the sequential arrangement of elements based on planetary hours and is formulated during a time of optimal astrological alignment.

The Sigil: ⏀♈⛢♂⚳⚴♅

Each individual element of the sigil holds its meaning:

1. ⏀ - The symbol of the Monad, representing unity and singularity from which all things manifest. It serves as a foundation for the sigil, ensuring harmony and balance in its manifestation.

2. ♈ - The symbol of Aries, an astrological sign ruled by Mars. This initiates the sigil with potent, transformative energies for change and new beginnings.

3. ⛢ - The astronomical symbol for Earth, grounding the intention of the sigil in the physical world.

4. ♂ - The symbol of Mars, infusing the sigil with courage, determination, and fortitude.

5. ⚳ - The Hermetic symbol for Mercury, endowing the sigil with communication, adaptability, and skill.

6. ⚴ - The mystical symbol for Jupiter, bringing expansion, abundance, and spiritual growth.

7. ♅ - The alchemical symbol for Uranus, providing change, innovation, and enlightenment for the sigil's purpose.

The construction of this arcane sigil is completed during a unique astrological alignment, occurring specifically on a Tuesday—a day ruled by Mars—during the planetary hour of Mars when the Moon is in Aries. These interlocking components amplify the transformative and courageous energies of the sigil, enhancing its overall potency and effectiveness.

This advanced sigil serves to catalyze transformation, initiate new beginnings, and imbue the bearer with courage, determination, and fortitude. The harmonious blend of planetary symbols and astrological glyphs taps into the power of the universe, aligning with the natural cycles and flow of cosmic energies.

By working with this sigil and activating its powers at the right astrological moment, the practitioner benefits from enhanced abilities to create rapid growth, positive change, and manifest their goals within their physical reality. The sigil's intricate design holds the key to unlocking the latent energy of the universe and channeling it towards desired outcomes.
