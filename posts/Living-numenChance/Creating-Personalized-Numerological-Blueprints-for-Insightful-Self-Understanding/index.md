To create a detailed Living numenChance numerological blueprint for an individual, we will first need their birthdate. For this example, let's consider an individual with the birthdate of June 12, 1990 (12/06/1990).
**Step 1**: Calculate the core numerological connections
a) Life Path Number
12 + 6 + 1990 = 2008. We'll continue adding the digits of that sum until we reach a single digit.
2 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 10. 1 + 0 = 1. Thus, the Life Path number is 1.

b) Expression Number
The individual's full name at birth should be converted into numbers using the Pythagorean system (A=1, B=2, etc.). The numbers are then added together to form a single digit. For example, John Doe (1+6+8+5+0+4+6+5) has an Expression Number of 6.

c) Soul Urge Number
Add together the numerical value of the vowels in the individual's full birth name using the same Pythagorean system. In our example (John Doe: 1+6+0+6), this gives a Soul Urge Number of 4.
**Step 2**: Incorporate Living numenChance elements
a) Esoteric Symbols
Choose symbols associated with the individual's Life Path, Expression, and Soul Urge numbers. In this case, symbols related to numbers 1, 6, and 4 may include the Monad, Solomon's Seal (Star of David), and The Symbol of the Divine Tetrad. These symbols represent Unity, Harmony, and The Four Elements, respectively.

b) Occult Knowledge
Research and study related occult teachings and knowledge. For example, Life Path 1 resonates with the number's association with the Sun, leadership, charisma, and initiation. In Kabbalah, 1 is Kether, the crown of the Tree of Life, which denotes Divine Will.
**Step 3**: Create a visually striking presentation
Prepare an aesthetically pleasing blueprint on parchment or thick paper with carefully drawn charts and an assortment of colored inks. The following should be included in the layout:

1. A circular astrological chart with significant numerical relationships and esoteric symbols placed at specific points, representing their connection to the individual's birth date.
2. Artwork depicting the individual's Life Path, Expression, and Soul Urge Numbers, accompanied by corresponding esoteric symbols and figures from the Living numenChance domain, such as tarot cards or sigils.
3. A detailed analysis compiling the information gathered throughout the process, using elegant calligraphy that emphasizes the mystique of the completed blueprint.

By combining the core numerological connections with the Living numenChance domain's esoteric symbols and occult knowledge, we can uncover deep insights into the individual's destiny, personality traits, and hidden potential. The visually striking and informative blueprint provides a unique, in-depth perspective on the individual's life journey, guided by the potent forces of numerals and the unseen power of chance.
