In Christian Cabalism, correlations between celestial bodies and angelic correspondences can be found in various ancient texts, scriptures, and teachings of Christian mystics. Here, we establish the connection between the seven classical planets and the corresponding angels within the Hierarchy of Angels.

1. **Saturn - Associated Angel**: Cassiel
Cassiel, also known as Caphriel or Kepharel, is the angelic ruler of Saturn. Cassiel embodies the attributes of wisdom, introspection, and discipline. Some texts ascribe the responsibility of overseeing chronology, fate, and karma to Cassiel. Additionally, his celestial hierarchy is associated with the restrictions and limitations that humans face in life. The spiritual significance of this connection can be linked to the understanding of the inevitability of human limitations and the importance of endurance.

2. **Jupiter - Associated Angel**: Zadkiel
Zadkiel, often called Tzadkiel or Zachariel, is the angelic ruler of Jupiter. Zadkiel represents the qualities of mercy, forgiveness, and justice. This angel is tasked with watching over humanity to encourage spiritual growth and fair resolution of disputes. Jupiter's expansive nature connects with Zadkiel's ability to aid individuals in understanding the concept of divine love and cosmic harmony.

3. **Mars - Associated Angel**: Camael
Camael, alternatively known as Kemuel or Samael, corresponds to the planet Mars. Camael reflects the principles of courage, protection, and decisiveness. As the celestial warrior and guardian of humanity, Camael fights against evil and watches over those who stand up for what is right. The spiritual connection between Mars and Camael reminds individuals of the importance of combating negative influences and cultivating inner strength.

4. **Sun - Associated Angel**: Michael
Archangel Michael, known as the Prince of Light, reigns over the Sun. Michael symbolizes the power of truth, courage, and protection. Michael’s role in the Hierarchy of Angels is to lead the celestial armies against evil and protect the souls of the righteous. The Sun's correspondence with Michael highlights the significance of self-expression and the development of individuality in one's spiritual journey.

5. **Venus - Associated Angel**: Anael
Anael, also known as Haniel or Aniel, governs the planet Venus. Anael represents beauty, love, and diplomacy. This angel serves to inspire creativity, harmonious relationships, and appreciation for nature. The alliance between Venus and Anael teaches individuals to embrace the power of love and connection in their spiritual growth.

6. **Mercury - Associated Angel**: Raphael
Archangel Raphael, the Great Healer, rules over Mercury. Raphael embodies the attributes of communication, healing, and wisdom. This angel oversees the dissemination of knowledge, the healing of the Earth, and the guidance of travelers on their journeys. The connection between Mercury and Raphael encourages seekers of spiritual wisdom to value intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge.

7. **Moon - Associated Angel**: Gabriel
Archangel Gabriel, known as the Messenger, corresponds to the Moon. Gabriel signifies emotional awareness, intuition, and revelation. This angel is responsible for interpreting the divine will and delivering messages to humanity. The bond between the Moon and Gabriel suggests the importance of being receptive to the guidance of the spiritual realm and honoring one’s inner world.

By utilizing sacred geometry and numerology, we can understand the interconnectivity of these celestial bodies. The traditional system of the Tree of Life used in Kaballah can represent these connections, considering the seven classical planets linked to the seven lower Sephirot on the tree.

Also, the sacred heptagram, a seven-pointed star, can symbolize the harmony between the planets and their corresponding angels, emphasizing the balance and interconnected nature of the divine realms. These celestial alliances within Christian Cabalism reveal profound insights into the human condition and our relationship with the spiritual world, encouraging seekers to contemplate the multidimensional aspects of existence.
