The rich tapestry of global folk-magical traditions exhibit a fascinating web of connections and shared characteristics. For the purposes of this challenge, we will focus on three such traditions: the Nordic runes system, West African Ifá divination system, and the Tarot cards in Western-European tradition. While these three systems developed independently in different regions of the world, their shared similarities highlight the commonality of human experience and the ways in which cultures transmit and adapt knowledge.

Shared Similarities between Three Folk-Magical Traditions:

1. **Divination and Future-Reading**: All three of these systems - Nordic runes, Ifá, and Tarot - involve methods for seeking insights into the future or understanding the nature of various aspects of existence. 

In the case of Nordic runes, rune stones were cast upon a cloth, and the resulting patterns were interpreted to provide guidance and insight. Ifá practitioners use the sacred Opele chain or palm nuts (Ikin) to consult the unknowable future, while the Tarot consists of a deck of 78 illustrated cards, whose arrangements are read and interpreted according to established symbolism.

2. **Symbolism and Mythology**: Each of these traditions is rich with symbolic representation and narrative. 

The Nordic runes are not just a writing system, but representations of the Norse gods and elements of their mythology. In the Ifá tradition, divination is founded upon the knowledge of 256 sacred Odu conglomerates, each representing an array of mythological stories and proverbs. The Tarot cards, likewise, are steeped in symbolism that draws from various traditions, including Christian, Egyptian, medieval, and Kabbalistic sources.

3. **Initiation and Training**: To practice and fully understand these magical systems, it is expected that the individual undergoes a period of teaching and initiation. 

Runemasters, for instance, required significant training to master not only reading the runes, but also understanding the spellcraft associated with them. Similarly, Ifá demands years of dedicated study to be a priest in the form of Babalawos or Iyanifas, while Tarot also has its specialized practitioners who undergo rigorous apprenticeship to become proficient readers.

Evolution of Characteristics over Time:

A. **Cultural Exchanges**: The ongoing movement and exchange of people, ideas, and resources has profoundly affected the evolution and development of these magical systems. 

Trade routes and migrations allowed the Norse people to incorporate concepts of runic symbolism into other cultures, such as the Saxon and Celtic tradition. Similar exchanges occurred in Western Africa, where the expansion of Yoruba culture spread the practice of Ifá to neighboring societies. Tarot, which has its roots in the playing cards brought to Europe through trade with Islamic countries, adopted and integrated symbols from various theological and philosophical traditions.

B. **Adaptation**: As each magical tradition encountered new cultural and environmental contexts, practitioners had to adapt it to suit local beliefs and values. 

One noteworthy example is the Afro-Caribbean practice of Santería, which combines elements of Ifá with Catholic saint worship, a result of West African slaves adapting their belief system within the constraints imposed by their oppressors in the New World. 

C. **Universal Human Experiences**: The fact that these traditions are, at their core, concerned with fundamental aspects of the human experience (such as birth, death, love, and warfare) allows them to resonate across different cultures and timescales.

In conclusion, we can identify the shared similarities between the Nordic runes system, West African Ifá divination system, and the Tarot cards as elements of divination and future-reading, symbolism and mythology, and initiation and training. These characteristics have evolved over time due to cultural exchanges, adaptations, and the fact that they address underlying universal human experiences. It is our desire to understand, influence, and predict outcomes in our lives that continue to keep these ancient systems relevant and intriguing, fostering their development and perpetuation across generations.
