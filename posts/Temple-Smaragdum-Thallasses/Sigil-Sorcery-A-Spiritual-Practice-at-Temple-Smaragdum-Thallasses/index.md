## I. Introduction

Sigil sorcery within the Temple Smaragdum Thallasses is a specialized and sacred practice that combines elemental forces with sacred geometry to manifest desired outcomes. The unique approach of the Temple focuses on various aspects, from sigil creation to final disposal, with meticulous attention to detail and adherence to the Temple's doctrines.

### II. **Sigil Creation**: Elemental Forces and Sacred Geometry

In Temple Smaragdum Thallasses, sigil creation is a refined and intricate process that harmonizes elemental forces with sacred geometry. The practitioner begins by establishing a connection with the elements of earth, air, fire, and water through meditation and visualization. The sacred geometrical patterns, such as the Seed of Life or Metatron's Cube, are then drawn with the intention of channeling and balancing these elemental energies.

### III. Desired Outcomes and Sigil Design

Specific examples of desired outcomes sought by members of the Temple include summoning elemental guardians, enhancing spiritual abilities, and manifesting abundance. These objectives directly affect the design of the sigil, as the visual elements and symbols that are incorporated embody the intention set by the practitioner. For example, a sigil for strengthening spiritual abilities may incorporate the Ankh or the Eye of Horus, ancient symbols of spiritual wisdom and power.

### IV. Selection and Consecration of Ritual Tools and Ingredients

The Temple Smaragdum Thallasses places great emphasis on the quality and preparation of ritual tools, ingredients, and materials. The practitioner is expected to be highly selective in choosing components that align with the Temple's teachings and the specific intention of the sigil. The consecration of these tools is of vital importance, as it symbolizes the establishment of a divine connection between the practitioner and the objects. After proper cleansing and blessing, the materials are deemed ready for use in the ritual process.

### V. Sigil Construction and Charging with Intention

When constructing the sigil charged with intention, Temple Smaragdum Thallasses practitioners rely on their signature techniques, such as binding the sigil using ancient alphabets or channeling specific deities associated with the Temple. Furthermore, the practitioner must maintain a deep meditative state during the sigil's creation to ensure maximum potency and effectiveness.

### VI. Activation and Empowerment of the Sigil

To activate and empower the sigil, practitioners of Temple Smaragdum Thallasses employ meditative states, energy manipulation techniques, and specific visualization procedures, mantras, and invocations. The practitioner remains engaged in these practices before, during, and after the sigil's activation to uphold a strong connection with the elemental forces and divine energies present.

### VII. Discharging and Disposal of the Sigil

The final stages of the sigil sorcery process involve discharging the sigil and disposing of it according to the mystical practices of Temple Smaragdum Thallasses. Depending on the sigil's purpose and the teachings, the sigil may be burned, buried, or submerged in various elemental substances that hold significance within the Temple's doctrines. This stage is essential for releasing the energy of the sigil and allowing its manifestation in the physical world.

### VIII. Journaling, Reflection, and Follow-up Rituals

Practitioners of Temple Smaragdum Thallasses are encouraged to maintain a journal to record their experiences with sigil sorcery, including details of their rituals, reflections on outcomes, and perceived progress.
