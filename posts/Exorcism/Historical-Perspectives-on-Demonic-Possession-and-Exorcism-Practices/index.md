In order to address the knowledge challenge, let us first examine the historical, socio-cultural, psychological, and theological factors and their intricate interconnections, and how they have influenced demonic possession and the development of exorcistic practices. Following this, we will analyze the extent to which the personal attributes and belief systems of both the exorcist and possessed individual affect the results and perceptions of the exorcism ritual.

Historically, demonic possessions and exorcisms have been documented since ancient times in various cultures and religious traditions. For example, we can trace exorcistic practices back to ancient Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt, and Hinduism, wherein priests and shamans conducted rituals to expel malignant spirits or energies. In these ancient societies, supernatural beliefs were intertwined with everyday life, making it easier for the population to accept and validate the existence of demonic possessions.

Socio-culturally, various factors have influenced how different societies perceive and react to demonic possessions. These factors can include folklore and mythology, religious practices, societal norms, superstitions, and even mass hysteria. For instance, the Puritan society in colonial America led to the infamous Salem witch trials, where numerous individuals were accused of witchcraft and demonic possession. Similarly, during the Spanish Inquisition, people were scapegoated as possessed or involved in witchcraft based on cultural and religious prejudices.

From a psychological perspective, demonic possession might represent a physical manifestation of complex psychopathological and psycho-social issues, such as schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder, or a reaction to traumatic experiences. In some instances, the symptoms of these conditions might be misinterpreted as signs of possession, leading to the development of exorcistic rituals as a means to confront and cope with the underlying psychological challenges.

Theologically, the concept of demonic possession has deep roots in various religious traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. These religions have developed various exorcistic rituals to address such possessions, with the exorcist acting as a representative of divine authority, invoking the power of God to cast out the malevolent spirit. The contrast between good and evil, order and chaos, serves as a moral framework that informs the development and implementation of these exorcistic practices.

Now, when examining the extent to which personal attributes and belief systems of the exorcist and possessed individual affect the results and perceptions of the exorcism rituals, we must recognize that both parties bring their own cognitive and emotional baggage to the process. The exorcist, who is often a religious figure (e.g., priest, minister, or shaman), must have faith in their spiritual authority and the efficacy of the ritual. A deep conviction in their ability to confront and repel evil influences the effectiveness of the exorcism and their psychological presence during the ritual.

On the other hand, the possessed individual's belief system and socio-cultural context are equally important. If they interpret their symptoms as a demonic possession, they may show a higher degree of trust and receptiveness towards the exorcist and the ritual itself. The power of suggestion and the placebo effect can play a significant role in the efficacy and outcome of the exorcism, as the individual's belief in the process may lead to the alleviation of their psychological or physiological symptoms.

In conclusion, the manifestation of demonic possession and the development of exorcistic practices stem from a complex interplay of historical, socio-cultural, psychological, and theological factors that shape the perceptions and reactions of various societies and individuals. Personal attributes and belief systems of both the exorcist and possessed individual greatly influence the results and perceptions of the exorcism ritual, demonstrating the profound impact that human psychology and culture have on our understanding and confrontation of the supernatural.
