excerpt: Conduct an extensive and meticulous diagnostic evaluation of an individual, specifically targeting signs of demonic possession by incorporating analysis of their behavioral, physical, mental, and historical aspects. Delve into potential triggers, such as engagement in occult practices or cursed objects, and identify any known or previously unencountered demonic entities of concern. Utilize a multi-step approach, including observation, exploratory dialogue, and Occult-Rorschach assessments to discern the extent of possession and strategize an effective exorcism plan tailored to their unique circumstances. Collaborate with a skilled divination expert for additional insight, if necessary.

Step 1: Initial Observation

Begin with an initial assessment of the individual by observing their behavior, physical appearance, and any abnormalities that could suggest demonic possession. Pay close attention to details such as changes in their character, the presence of an unnatural aura, or any inexplicable physical marks.

Step 2: Personal History Assessment

Inquire about the individual's personal and family history to identify any potential triggers that may have led to demonic possession. This includes exploring any possible engagement in occult practices, past traumas, or exposure to cursed objects. Obtain information on any prior experiences with the supernatural or unexplained phenomena.

Step 3: Mental and Emotional Analysis

Conduct an in-depth interview with the individual to assess their mental and emotional state. Ask open-ended questions that encourage them to discuss their thoughts and emotions freely. Remain empathetic and non-judgmental to foster a trusting environment during the process.

Step 4: Occult-Rorschach Assessment

Administer the Occult-Rorschach Assessment, which is a specialized version of the Rorschach inkblot test designed to identify occult influences and symbolic patterns that may be indicative of demonic possession. Carefully analyze the individual's responses for signs of abnormal interpretation, odd associations, or the presence of sinister themes.

Step 5: Collaborate with a Divination Expert

If necessary, consult with a skilled divination expert to obtain further insight into the individual's situation. Divination practices such as tarot, rune casting, or scrying can offer additional context to help pinpoint the precise nature of the demonic entity and its intentions.

Step 6: Identification of Demonic Entities

Analyze the combined information from the previous steps to identify any known or previously unencountered demonic entities that may be of concern. With this information, it is possible to understand their modus operandi, strengths, and weaknesses, which is critical for formulating an effective exorcism strategy.

Step 7: Customized Exorcism Plan

Develop a tailored exorcism plan specific to the individual's unique circumstances. This plan should take into account the type of demonic entity involved, the extent of possession, and any personal factors relevant to the individual. The plan should include the use of appropriate rituals, prayers, and protective measures to ensure the success of the exorcism and the safety of all involved.

Step 8: Execution of Exorcism

Carry out the exorcism by following the customized plan previously devised. Enlist the assistance of any necessary experts, such as other specialists in exorcism or divination. Be prepared to adapt the plan and rituals in response to any unexpected challenges or manifestations throughout the process.

Step 9: Post-Exorcism Support

After successfully completing the exorcism, provide ongoing support and guidance to the individual in adjusting to their newfound freedom from possession. Offer counseling, spiritual guidance, and resources to help them rediscover their sense of self and prevent future instances of demonic possession.
