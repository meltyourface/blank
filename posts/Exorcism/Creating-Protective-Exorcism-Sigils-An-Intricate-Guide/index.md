To create a multi-layered and intricately designed exorcism-focused sigil, we must begin by understanding the purpose and intent of our sigil. Its primary goal is to offer exceptional protective capabilities during an exorcism ritual, while also strengthening the effectiveness of the process across every dimension, with emphasis on specifics relating to the entity being exorcised.

To fabricate the sigil, incorporate these key elements:

1. Pentagram: Use the five-pointed star symbol as the foundation of the sigil, representing the balance of the five natural elements – earth, air, fire, water, and spirit.

2. Eye of Horus: Layer the Eye of Horus within the pentagram to enhance the sigil's protective attributes and invoke wisdom, protection, and healing.

3. Seal of Solomon: Weave the Seal of Solomon around the Eye of Horus and pentagram to provide a strong binding and banishing effect against malevolent entities.

4. Archangelic Sigils: Surround the central elements with the sigils of the four primary Archangels, each associated with the four cardinal directions – Michael (East), Uriel (North), Gabriel (West), and Raphael (South). This is meant to invoke their divine protection and guidance during the exorcism.

5. Personalized Symbolism: Integrate symbols specific to the entity being exorcised that represent its weaknesses or vulnerabilities, such as a herb, crystal, or numerical sequence.

6. Inscriptions: Border the sigil with a Cuneiform or Latin inscription invoking divine authority, protection, and victory, such as "In Nomine Dei, Vincit Lux Veritatis" ("In the name of God, the light of truth conquers").

The intended use and placement of the sigil align with these guidelines:

1. Use: Draw the sigil on a material conducive to the specific entity being exorcised, such as a parchment, metal sheet, or blessed cloth. Anoint it with a mixture of holy water, consecrated oils, and crushed herbs that are effective in repelling the particular entity.

2. Placement: Place the sigil strategically within the ritual space to maximize its efficacy – this may include the central area where the exorcism subject is located, the entrance to the room to prevent the entity's escape, or worn by the exorcist as a protective talisman.

3. Activation: To activate the sigil during the exorcism process, follow these steps:
   a. Light candles that correspond to the colors associated with the Archangels – gold (Michael), black (Uriel), white (Gabriel), and green (Raphael).
   b. Recite a prayer or invocation, calling upon the powers of the sigil's symbols and its corresponding entities.
   c.offer a libation or offering to strengthen the connections to the invoked energies.
   d. Trace the sigil in the air with consecrated incense or a ritual dagger to solidify its presence in the ritual space.

Through this multi-layered and intricate design of an exorcism-focused sigil, one can enhance the protective capabilities and effectiveness of the exorcism ritual for both the subject and the practitioner.
