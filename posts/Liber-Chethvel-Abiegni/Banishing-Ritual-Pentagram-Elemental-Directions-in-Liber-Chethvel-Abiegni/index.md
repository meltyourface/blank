The Liber Chethvel Abiegni Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LCABRP)

**Introduction**:

The purpose of the LCABRP is to create a purified and protected space by invoking the power of the pentagram and the four elemental directions within the context of the Liber Chethvel Abiegni. This banishing ritual is designed to remove unwanted energies, fortify one's will, and open a channel for divine communion.

### I. **The Unique Pentagram Design**:

Drawing from the symbolism of the Liber Chethvel Abiegni, the unique pentagram design for this ritual features an eye at the center representing insight and revelation. Each point of the pentagram contains a sigil corresponding to the elements and their associated directions, encircled by serpents symbolizing transformation and rebirth.

### II. **Incorporation of the Four Elements and Directions**:

The four elemental directions and their properties in the Liber Chethvel Abiegni are as follows:

1. **Earth/North**: Stability, structure, and physicality. Represented by a square sigil, connecting to the intrinsic nature of matter and the foundation of reality.
2. **Air/East**: Intellect, communication, and creativity. Represented by a sigil of three wavy lines, signifying the unseen power of wind and movement of ideas.
3. **Fire/South**: Energy, transformation, and passion. Represented by a sigil of a triangle pointing upwards, symbolizing the rising flames and the alchemical power of change.
4. **Water/West**: Emotion, intuition, and healing. Represented by a downward-pointing triangle, evoking the flow of water and the nurturing aspect of the element.

### III. **Ritual's Progression**:

1. Begin by standing facing the east with arms outstretched in the form of a cross, and take several deep breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.
2. Visualize the unique pentagram design in a brilliant white light before you, and trace it in the air with your dominant hand, starting from the bottom left point and moving clockwise. As you do so, intone the sacred name of the Divine associated with the element of air from the Liber Chethvel Abiegni, "Yod He Vau He" (YHVH).
3. Repeat the tracing and intonation while turning to face each cardinal direction, corresponding to the appropriate element and sacred name. Continue with fire/south ("Elohim"), water/west ("Adonai"), and earth/north ("Agla").
4. Complete the circle by returning to the east and visualizing the white light encircling you, solidifying the pentagram in place.
5. Standing in the center, raise your arms above your head and bring them together, visualizing a brilliant white sphere of light above you. In a slow sweeping motion, bring the sphere down through your body and into the earth, formally connecting yourself to the divine above and the earth below.

### IV. **Desired Outcome**:

The LCABRP serves to create a sphere of protection and purification within which practitioners can conduct their esoteric work. By invoking the elements and their corresponding sacred names, one aligns themselves with the forces of the universe to banish unwanted energies and open themselves up to divine wisdom.

### V. **Analysis and Creative Incorporation**:

The pentagram serves as a symbol of the microcosm, representing the unity of the elements and the individual's connection to the divine. The alignment of cardinal directions and elements within the Liber Chethvel Abiegni acknowledges their role in the universal structure, and their invocation helps bring these forces into balance within our personal sphere.

Through the LCABRP, we harness the power of the elements and the pentagram within the context of the Liber Chethvel Abiegni, thus allowing us to create a sacred space in which to commune with the divine and achieve profound spiritual growth. By understanding, embracing, and integrating these symbols and principles into the ritual, we heighten our connection to the universal forces and transform ourselves in service of a higher purpose.
