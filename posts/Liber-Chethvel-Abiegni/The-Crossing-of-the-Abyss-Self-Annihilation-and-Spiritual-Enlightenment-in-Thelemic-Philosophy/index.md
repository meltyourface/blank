In order to analyze the symbolic representation of the crossing of the abyss in Liber Cheth and its connection to the concepts of the Magister Templi, Nemo, and the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA), it is crucial to first understand some of the key elements and context of these concepts. 

Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni is a Thelemic holy book written by Aleister Crowley, which focuses on themes of self-discipline, self-reliance, and self-sacrifice. In the context of Crowley's system, the crossing of the abyss represents a spiritual and psychological ordeal. It is the transformational stage wherein an individual transcends the limitations of ego, overcomes their innermost fears, and achieves the spiritual state of "knowledge and conversation" with the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA). This culminates in the complete annihilation of the self before true spiritual wisdom can be obtained.

On the other side of the abyss lies the concept of the Magister Templi - Master of the Temple - which symbolizes the individual who has successfully navigated the abyss and emerged into the spiritual domain of self-realization. As a Magister Templi, one is intimately connected to their HGA, and their will is guided by an enlightened spiritual source.

Nemo, meaning "no one" in Latin, represents the aspirant who has achieved this spiritual state and effectively become 'no one,' having renounced all personal attachments and illusions of self. This paradoxical concept highlights the significance of self-annihilation in the attainment of wisdom; only by becoming Nemo can one attain true self-realization.

Now, let's delve into the symbolic representation of the crossing of the abyss and its connection to the aforementioned concepts. In Liber Cheth, the crossing is represented by the characteristics of a desert, a wall, and a threshold. The desert symbolizes the formidable, arduous nature of the ordeal, while the wall signifies the separation between the individual who has not yet traversed the abyss, and the spiritual insights awaiting those who successfully embark on this journey. The threshold, then, marks that fateful crossing - where the transformation and self-annihilation happen.

The paradoxical relationship between self-annihilation and the attainment of wisdom lies in the concept that one must die to their former self in order to be reborn into their true spiritual potential. As Nemo, there is no distinction between the individual will and divine will; they are integrated, thus bringing the aspirant closer to the HGA and the Magister Templi state. Of course, this is no easy task; only through immense self-discipline and self-sacrifice can one hope to traverse the abyss.

Moreover, the attainment of wisdom as a Magister Templi is paradoxically both absolute and illusory. The individual realizes that there is more to learn and experience and that wisdom is an ongoing process. As they have now grasped the essence of the Holy Guardian Angel, they understand that the purpose of their journey is not an endpoint, but a continuous exploration and evolution.

In conclusion, the symbolic representation of the crossing of the abyss in Liber Cheth is deeply intertwined with the concepts of the Magister Templi, Nemo, and the HGA. The crossing demonstrates a paradoxical journey where self-annihilation paves the way for wisdom and spiritual enlightenment. Highlighting the paradoxical relationship between these elements, Crowley emphasizes the significance of embracing the struggle, self-discipline, and self-sacrifice to attain the union with one's HGA and ultimately progress along the spiritual journey. At the same time, the adept acknowledges that this attainment is merely a doorway to further exploration, growth, and understanding.
