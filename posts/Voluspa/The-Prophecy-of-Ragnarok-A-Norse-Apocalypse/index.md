In the dusk of doom's approach, seeress whispers wake,
Grim prophecies, shadows cast o'er Midgard's fate,
In elder tongue, she seeks to seed the endtime's ghastly grace,
Prophetic echoes herald the dread Ragnarok's embrace.

By her words unfold dread warnings, tense the tapestry,
Woven wyrds speak the tale, void's unsettling decree,
Dim light falls o'er broken shields that tremble before night,
Nine worlds brace, clashing drums of giants to incite.

Iron rain hammers the ground, clawed from fearsome skies,
As serpentine shadows cast their venomous demise,
Biding strength, the brothers of brutish birth await,
Jotnar's forbearance cracked, crumbling under chilling fate.

In seeress' sight, forged frame of fate's demise unfurls,
Shield's screech sent forth, the world wheels crack with evil's hurl,
Skies rend apart as flame-giants with blazing brand do thrash,
Chaos dances across lands and seas, dread fates to clash.

Gods seek council, trembling heights responding to the weight,
Fiery words between mighty kin embroil darkest debate,
Thunder's lord red-clad hangs sword of judgment to bear,
Against black giants' starkened ranks, to grasp impending snare.

Wild wolf descends upon the age, with crimson maw agape,
And from the depths, his serpent kin, slithers its deadly shape,
Runes swirl and twist, erratic patterns hanging from the tree,
Fortold, the doom of ancient gods that face eternity.

Fearful foemen on the sudden plains trample oaths and bonds,
As sea and sky mirror fires, where loyal kin responds,
In iron rain, golden halls of hallowed ground must fall,
Rise, divine hosts, to answer the darker aspects' call.

Prophetic words of seeress' wyrds, forebode the lasting doom,
Eerie air, where tensions rise, swift approaching rooms,
Heed the saga spun of fate, whispered in Voluspa,
As fields of Vigrid faded lie, gods and giants fray.
