Ritual Name: The Sanguine Requiem

**Objective**: To exorcise and violently purify a cursed or tainted weapon, stripping it of malevolent energies and freeing the souls of its victims, while potentially harnessing some of its past power.

**Ingredients**:

1. An altar - Upon this surface, the weapon will be laid during the ritual.
2. Salt - Representing purity and protection, creating a barrier against evil forces.
3. Blood - Human or animal, representing life force, a powerful energetic conduit for the transformation.
4. Candles - Black and white, symbolizing the duality of light and darkness.
5. Incense - Sandalwood or sage, to cleanse and dispel malevolent energies.
6. Talismans - Bone or metal, inscribed with sigils of protection and power.
7. A chalice - To hold the blood and serve as a receptacle for the purified energies.
8. A ceremonial dagger - To represent authority and control of the ritual.

**Steps**:

1. **Prepare the ritual space**: Cleanse the area by burning the chosen incense and create a circle of salt around the perimeter to ward off negative energies. Arrange the candles in a circle within the salt, black candles to the west and white candles to the east.

2. Place the altar at the center of the circle and position the weapon on top. Ensuring the weapon is fully encompassed by the energetic barrier illuminated by the candles.

3. Carve or mark sigils of protection and power onto the talismans, and arrange them around the weapon in a balanced pattern.

4. Fill the chalice with the chosen blood and set it on the altar, close to the weapon.

5. **Begin the invocation**: Call upon the deities, spirits, or forces you venerate and request their guidance and assistance. State your intentions clearly and with conviction.

6. Use the ceremonial dagger to draw a symbol of sacred geometry or a potent sigil around the weapon on the altar. This act signifies your control over the ritual and the sealing of the weapon's negative powers.

7. Anoint the weapon in the blood from the chalice, symbolizing the infusion of life force to neutralize its dark energies. Recite incantations that emphasize cleansing, release, and empowerment.

8. Visualize the trapped souls and malevolent energies leaving the weapon, draining into the chalice as their new vessel. See the weapon gleam with a purified, balanced aura.

9. Conclude the ritual by thanking the deities, spirits, or forces for their help. Extinguish the candles, dismantle the talismans, and break the salt circle.

10. Dispose of the chalice's contents safely and respectfully, as it now holds the purified remnants of souls and dark energies.

Potential Consequences and Side Effects:

While the Sanguine Requiem seeks to restore balance and purify the weapon, residual consequences may linger. The weapon may retain a sense of darkness, albeit a controlled one, granting its wielder power but necessitating a strong moral compass to avert corruption.

The ritual could open the user up to unwanted spiritual attachments if not performed diligently or if they lack the resolve to control the power channeled. It is crucial to maintain regular energetic hygiene practices to keep the user and weapon in harmony.

Remember that the power of the Sanguine Requiem is in the hands of the one who wields the weapon, and true mastery comes from understanding the balance between light and darkness.
