## The Dark Conclave of Enochian Rib of Belial

**Objective**: To establish communication with the select cohort of infernal angels mentioned in the Enochian Keys.

**Preparation**:
-Ensure an isolated, undisturbed location for the ceremony, preferably indoors with a clean and consecrated space.
-Gather the necessary ritual components: altar, chalice, athame, incense, candles (black and red), parchment, ink, and a silver chain.
-Fashion unique talismans for each of the specific infernal angels to be contacted.
-Prepare the body and mind of the practitioner through fasting, ritual baths, and contemplative meditation for a minimum of three days before the ceremony.

The Ceremony:

1. Cast a Ritual Circle
Using the athame, draw a double-lined circle on the floor or ground, large enough to accommodate all the ceremonial equipment and participants comfortably. Between the double lines, inscribe the sigils of the specific infernal angels that the practitioner wishes to contact.

2. Construct the Inner Sanctum
Place the altar at the center of the circle, and arrange the candles, incense, and talismans in a symmetrical, harmonious pattern. Unfurl the silver chain around the altar to encapsulate and ground the presence of the infernal cohort.

3. Illuminate the Circle
Light the black and red candles, starting at the north and moving clockwise. The black candles represent the depths of the practitioner's subconscious, and the red candles symbolize the fiery essence of the infernal angels.

4. Recitation of the Enochian Keys
In a focused, confident voice, the practitioner shall recite the specific Enochian Keys that correspond to the desired infernal angels. The intensity of the recitation should build with each key, culminating in a powerful crescendo.

5. Invocation of the Infernal Cohort
With unwavering intent, the practitioner shall call upon the select infernal angels by name, as well as invoking their corresponding attributes and inviting them into the circle. Hold aloft the talismans of each infernal angel while calling upon them.

6. Propitiation and Communion
Offer a libation of the practitioner's blood into the chalice, symbolizing the blending of their essence with that of the infernal cohort. Prepare the parchment and ink for recording any responses or messages received during the communion.

7. Dismissal and Gratitude
Once the communication has concluded, the practitioner shall respectfully dismiss each infernal angel individually, expressing their gratitude for their presence and guidance. Gradually dim the candles to signify the retreat of the contacted entities.

8. Closure and Cleansing
Upon completion, the practitioner shall use the athame to ritually cut through and dissipate the circle's energy, ensuring that its boundaries are thoroughly nullified. Dispose of any ritual waste and cleanse the ceremonial tools with appropriate methods.

**Precautions**:

- Never attempt to seize control or manipulate the infernal angels. Maintain the utmost respect and humility in their presence.
- Ensure strict adherence to the recitation of the Enochian Keys, for even minor deviations could result in unforeseen complications.
- Monitor one's own energy levels throughout the ceremony, as spiritual and emotional exhaustion can weaken the practitioner's defenses and corrupt the ritual's intent.
- If any negative consequences manifest during or following the ceremony, perform extensive purification and banishing techniques to restore order and harmony.

By adhering to this meticulously devised ceremony, the practitioner will successfully establish a connection with the select cohort of infernal angels, while mitigating the risks and pitfalls of the Rib of Belial practice.
