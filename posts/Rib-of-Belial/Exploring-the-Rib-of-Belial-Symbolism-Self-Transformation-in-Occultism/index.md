To respond to this knowledge challenge, we need to first understand the key concepts mentioned, such as the Rib of Belial, dualism of light and darkness, subversion of sacred feminine energies, and the Left Hand Path. After having a grasp on these, we will delve into the intricate web of symbolism emanating from these concepts, and how they relate to self-transformation in occultism. Lastly, we will summarize the main themes and implications.

The Rib of Belial is an esoteric concept that represents the hidden or concealed power within darkness and chaos. This is often associated with the fall of angels, who fell from the Light to embrace the darkness, in order to gain self-awareness and independence. In certain interpretations, the Rib of Belial symbolizes the dark side of the sacred feminine principle, embodying transformative energies that can be channeled towards spiritual growth and transformation.

The dualism of light and darkness refers to the fundamental concept of balance in all aspects of existence, a notion commonly found in occultism. This duality is often manifested in the form of good and evil, order and chaos, or higher and lower principles. The play between these opposites gives shape to all magical practices and spiritual paths.

The subversion of sacred feminine energies hints at the process of shifting the focus away from the traditional, nurturing aspect of the feminine principle, and instead concentrating on the darker, more subversive aspects. In this context, the sacred feminine energies represent the gateway to occult secrets and transformation, which requires moving away from the socially accepted norms and dogmas.

The Left Hand Path is a spiritual approach that focuses on the individual's experience and development, as opposed to adhering to a collective set of beliefs or dogmas. Often associated with unconventional and taboo practices, the Left Hand Path can involve the exploration of one's shadow aspects, embracing one's deeper desires, and unlocking personal power through magical means.

Having established the foundation of these concepts, we can now comprehend the intricate web of symbolism pertaining to the Rib of Belial. To understand this symbolism in its full capacity, we must consider the following aspects:

1. Embracing the dualism of light and darkness: The Rib of Belial urges the aspirant to acknowledge and embrace the duality inherent within themselves and the world. This involves accepting the existence of both positive and negative aspects, and using this union to harness transformative energies. By comprehending this duality, the practitioner can transcend beyond the limitations of conventional moralism, attaining a genuine understanding of universal balance.

2. Subverting the sacred feminine energies: By tapping into the hidden, subversive, and often taboo aspects of the feminine principle, the adept utilizing the symbolism of the Rib of Belial is encouraged to explore the potential for growth and transformation in these under-acknowledged energies. This process requires a departure from the conventional associations with the feminine, delving into the realms of chaos and darkness that give rise to creative potential.

3. Walking the Left Hand Path: The Rib of Belial is emblematic of the Left Hand Path, requiring the aspirant to take responsibility for their own spiritual development and seek out their own truths. By challenging societal norms and taboos, the practitioner uncovers their own unique path, which can lead to spiritual significance and ultimately, self-transformation. Moreover, the embodiment of the Rib of Belial entails balancing light and darkness, as well as recognizing and subverting the sacred feminine energies to reveal one's true potential.

In summary, the intricate web of symbolism surrounding the Rib of Belial involves the interplay of dualism between light and darkness, the subversion of sacred feminine energies, and its correlation to the Left Hand Path. By exploring these complex interconnections, the practitioner can dive deeper into the multidimensional implications of self-transformation inherent in occultism. By embracing this web of symbolic connections and fully integrating them into one's individual practice, the true essence of the Rib of Belial can be truly understood.
