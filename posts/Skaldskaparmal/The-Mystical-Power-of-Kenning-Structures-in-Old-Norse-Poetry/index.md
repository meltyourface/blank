The linguistic intricacies of the kenning structure found in Skaldskaparmal are deeply rooted in the historical and cultural context of the Old Norse period, playing a significant role in how the esoteric, occult, and poetic aspects of knowledge are transmitted and decoded by students and initiates. In this response, I will explore the key components of the kenning structure, the unique layers of meaning embedded within the system, the intertwined relationship between Norse mythology and the esoteric meanings of the kennings, and ultimately, how engaging with this poetic system fosters spiritual and intellectual transformation.

To properly unpack the kenning structure, it's essential to ground our understanding in the broader Poetic Edda, a compilation of Old Norse poems that encompasses Skaldskaparmal. By exploring Skaldskaparmal specifically, we delve into the realm of poetic language and metaphor as a vital tool for communicating hidden knowledge. 

Kennings are a foundational feature of Old Norse poetry, characterized by their elusive and allusive nature. Through metaphors, kennings employ a variety of creative linguistic mechanisms—such as combining and substituting words—to hint at the subjects they represent. In examining kenning structure, we observe the use of periphrasis, referentiality, and circumscription. When breaking down the kenning "whale-road" for "sea," for instance, one can appreciate the intricate symbolism at play and the need to decipher it contextually. 

Given the fundamental role kennings serve in Skaldskaparmal, a deep understanding of this structure allows initiates to begin extracting hidden knowledge from Norse mythology. One must approach the interpretation of kennings from both a literal and a metaphysical standpoint. For example, the kenning "Baldr's bane" refers to the literal death of the god Baldr, yet it also carries broader esoteric connotations pertaining to loss, mourning, and the cyclical nature of life.

The kenning system, by design, masks deep truth within the very fabric of the language. As one extracts and internalizes hidden meanings concealed within these complex metaphors, their mind undergoes a transformative process. In this, one not only gains an intellectual appreciation for the poetry and history but also experiences a profound shift in consciousness shaped by spiritual growth and holistic understanding.

For initiates delving deep into the mysteries of Skaldskaparmal, the process of interpreting and interacting with the kennings—and thus the esoteric teachings of Norse cosmology, allegory, and symbol—can be akin to undergoing a spiritual and intellectual initiation. By untangling the intricate layers of meaning, one gradually transcends the limitations of ordinary thought processes, develops a heightened state of awareness and sensitivity to metaphor, and gains greater access to the concealed wisdom and profound insights encapsulated by Norse mythology. 

In summary, the kenning structure of Skaldskaparmal represents a vital linguistic and artistic pathway to receiving esoteric knowledge within Old Norse poetry. The complex metaphoric relationships embedded within kennings challenge seekers to decipher meanings on multiple levels, further emphasizing the connection between language and the profound spiritual wisdom of Norse mythology. Ultimately, the intellectual and spiritual transformations experienced through engaging with the kenning system embody a testament to the intrinsic power of language, opening portals to a deeper awareness of life's great mysteries.
