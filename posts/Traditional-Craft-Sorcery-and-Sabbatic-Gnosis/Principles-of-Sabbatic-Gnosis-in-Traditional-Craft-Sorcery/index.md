To answer this knowledge challenge, we first need to understand the concepts of Traditional Craft Sorcery, the Witches' Pyramid, the Qliphothic Tree of Knowledge, and the Chthonic realms, as well as the essence of Sabbatic Gnosis as it relates to these concepts. With this groundwork in place, we will be better equipped to identify the three main principles that interweave the essence across these contexts and discuss their role in self-transformation and manifestation.

Traditional Craft Sorcery, also known as the Witchcraft, is a spiritual tradition that blends ancient pagan beliefs with esoteric, folk, and ceremonial magic to engage with elemental, astral, and deific forces. **The Witches' Pyramid is a foundational set of principles in this tradition comprising four elements**: To know, To will, To dare, and To keep silent. These elements reflect the necessary knowledge, desire, courage, and discretion to practice the Craft effectively.

The Qliphothic Tree of Knowledge is an esoteric, inverted portrayal of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, embodying the shadow or adverse aspects of reality. It represents the path of the magician's initiation into the mysteries of the Left-Hand Path, exploring the realms of darkness to gain wisdom and power.

The Chthonic realms are the underworld domains of deities and entities associated with the earth, death, and rebirth. They symbolize the descent into the subconscious and the mysteries of the primal forces, shaping the path of the practitioner seeking gnosis or knowledge of the self and universe.

Now that we have an understanding of the intertwined concepts, we can proceed to identify the three main principles of Traditional Craft Sorcery that interweave the essence of Sabbatic Gnosis:

1. **Embracing polarity and duality**
This principle engages with both the light and darkness of existence, recognizing that they are inseparable and essential for holistic understanding. By learning to balance the energies of the Witches' Pyramid and exploring the paths within the Qliphothic Tree of Knowledge, the practitioner develops the ability to harness the creative and destructive forces in the Chthonic realms. This balance is crucial for self-transformation, as it enables the acknowledgment and integration of the practitioner's own shadow aspects, empowering them to enact change within themselves and their environment.

2. **Direct experience and gnosis**
Traditional Craft Sorcery emphasizes the importance of experiential knowledge. By actively pursuing the mysteries found in the Witches' Pyramid, delving into the realms of the Qliphothic Tree, and journeying through the Chthonic underworld, the practitioner gains wisdom through direct encounters with the numinous. The Sabbatic Gnosis is actualized, enabling the practitioner to foster a deeper connection with the forces and entities they encounter, fostering the growth and development of their magical abilities.

3. **Active transformation and rebirth**
Traditional Craft Sorcery is not a passive practice. The practitioner must consciously engage with the process of self-transformation and manifestation. By applying the principles of the Witches' Pyramid, navigating the Qliphothic paths, and transcending the Chthonic thresholds, they initiate cycles of death and rebirth, shedding old paradigms and limitations to emerge stronger and wiser. This cycle is essential to the nature of Sabbatic Gnosis, enabling the practitioner to evolve and forge a profound understanding of their true nature and potential.

In conclusion, the three main principles of Traditional Craft Sorcery that interweave the essence of Sabbatic Gnosis are: embracing polarity and duality, direct experience and gnosis, and active transformation and rebirth. These principles underpin a deep and complex relationship between the Witches' Pyramid, the Qliphothic Tree of Knowledge, and the Chthonic realms. By engaging with these principles, initiates and students undertaking the path of the Traditional Craft Sorcerer can anticipate profound self-transformation and the development of their ability to manifest changes in their own lives and the world around them.
