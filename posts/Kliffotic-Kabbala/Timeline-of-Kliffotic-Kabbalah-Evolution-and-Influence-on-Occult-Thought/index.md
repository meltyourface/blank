The emergence, evolution, and intricacies of Kliffotic Kabbala can be delineated in the following comprehensive timeline:

1. **Pre-Kabbalistic Origins (circa 2nd century BCE-1st century CE)**: Various ancient texts and mystical practices from Jewish and Gnostic backgrounds, including the Merkabah (chariot) mysticism and early Christian mysticism, contain seeds of what would later develop into Kabbalah and Kliffotic Kabbala.

2. **Early Kabbalah and the Sefer Yetzirah (circa 2nd-6th centuries CE)**: With the authorship of the Sefer Yetzirah, also known as the "Book of Formation," we see the beginning of Kabbalistic thought. The text introduced the idea of the ten sefirot, divine emanations through which the Infinite interacts with the finite world. Though the Qliphoth, or Kliffotic emanations, are not explicitly mentioned, the roots of Left-Hand Path practices can be traced back to these early discussions on the sefirot.

3. **The Emergence of the Zohar (circa 13th century)**: The publication of the Zohar, a foundational work in the Kabbalistic tradition, further explored the sefirot and introduced the Tree of Life as a model for understanding the divine structure. It is within the Zohar that first mentions of the Qliphoth, or the "shells" that conceal the divine light, appear.

4. **Development of the Lurianic Kabbalah (circa 16th century)**: Isaac Luria, a significant Kabbalistic thinker, expanded upon the Qliphoth's role in his theosophy. He posited that the Qliphoth were a result of the cosmic "shattering" (Shevirat ha-Kelim). This development integrated the Kliffotic Kabbala more fully into the broader Kabbalistic framework.

5. **Emergence of the Sabbatean Movement (circa 1666)**: Sabbatai Zevi, a charismatic leader who claimed to be the Jewish messiah, incorporated Kliffotic elements into his teachings by engaging in antinomian practices. This movement introduced Kliffotic Kabbala to a wider audience and inspired the Frankist movement in the 18th century.

6. **Esoteric Orders and Occult Revival (19th-20th centuries)**: With the advent of modern esoteric orders such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Ordo Templi Orientis, and the works of figures like Aleister Crowley and Israel Regardie, Kliffotic Kabbala became explicitly connected to the Left-Hand Path. These practitioners began to focus on the Qliphoth as a means for personal transformation, power, and self-awareness, going beyond traditional Kabbalistic thought.

7. **The Late 20th Century and Beyond**: The modern renaissance of interest in the occult has led to a proliferation of information on Kliffotic Kabbala and Left-Hand Path practices. New Age authors like Kenneth Grant, Michael W. Ford, and Thomas Karlsson have written extensively on the subject, examining the Qliphoth as a path to self-discovery and spiritual transformation.

Throughout its history, Kliffotic Kabbala has exerted significant influence on the development of occult thought. Key turning points include the emergence of the Zohar and the inclusion of the Qliphoth, as well as the rise of esoteric orders and Left-Hand Path practices. As we continue to explore the depths of Kliffotic Kabbala, it is clear that its influence on the occult world will continue to grow.
