description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Kliffotic Kabbala, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a personal ritual focused on the Kliffotic Kabbala for the purpose of both initiations and empowerments. Select a specific Kliffotic sphere or entity to work with, such as Lilith, Samael, or Qliphoth itself. Incorporate a detailed sequence of events, including the preparation of a sacred space, invocation of the chosen Kliffotic energy, and the performance of a symbolic act representing the desired transformation. Additionally, provide suggestions for the use of appropriate symbols, tools, and incantations as well as any safety precautions or protective measures necessary to ensure a successful and meaningful experience.

Please note that working with the Kliffotic Kabbala and the entities within can be dangerous and is not advised for everyone. However, as requested, here is a general outline for a personal ritual focused on the Kliffotic Kabbala. In this example, we will focus on Samael, the Angel of Poison.

1. **Preparation of the Sacred Space**:
Find a quiet, secluded area where you can perform the ritual undisturbed. Ensure the space is clean and free of clutter. Prepare the area with symbols, sigils, and images associated with Samael and the Kliffotic sphere that he represents. Burn incense, such as sandalwood or dragon's blood, to enhance the atmosphere and cleanse the space.

2. **Gathering and Consecration of Tools**:
Select tools that resonate with the energies of Samael and the Kliffotic energies. These may include an athame or ceremonial dagger, a chalice, a pentacle, or other symbols of power and transformation. Each tool must be cleansed and consecrated prior to use. To do this, pass the tool through the incense smoke and envision it imbued with the energies of Samael and the Kabbalistic sphere he represents.

3. **Casting a Protective Circle**:
Using your chosen tool (e.g., athame or wand), cast a protective circle around your ritual space, visualizing a barrier of fiery energy that guards against unwanted outside influence. As you move clockwise around the circle, recite the following invocation: "I conjure and invoke the energies of Samael to guide and protect me within this sacred space."

4. **Invocation of Samael**:
Stand in the center of your circle, facing the East. Light a black or red candle representing Samael's energies. **Recite the following invocation to call upon his power**:

"Samael, Angel of Poison, Kliffotic guide, and harbinger of transformation, I call upon your strength and wisdom to empower me in this rite of initiation. May your essence descend upon me, and may your energies fill this space. Open my eyes to the hidden mysteries, and grant me the knowledge and power to walk the path of Kliffotic gnosis."

5. **The Symbolic Act of Transformation**:
Hold your chosen tool (e.g., athame or wand) and visualize yourself embodying the qualities you seek from Samael's energies. These may include increased power, fearlessness, or an enhanced ability to navigate the dark and hidden aspects of your psyche. Silently or aloud, recite a personal vow or commitment that solidifies your intent to walk the path of Kliffotic empowerment.

6. **Offerings**:
Present an offering to Samael as a symbol of gratitude for his assistance. This could be a cup of wine or an item with personal significance. Place the offering on your altar or sacred space and speak words of thanks to Samael for his presence and aid.

7. **Closing the Ritual**:
When you're ready, thank Samael for his presence and assistance, and bid him release by saying: "Samael, Angel of Poison and Kliffotic guide, I thank you for your presence and guidance. As you depart, I will carry your wisdom with me, ever growing stronger in the Kliffotic energies. Hail, and farewell."

Extinguish the candle and release the energies of the protective circle, going counterclockwise around your space, saying: "I release this circle of protection, the energies dissipating back to their origins, harm to none."

8. **Grounding and Integration**:
Take some time to ground yourself after the ritual, either through meditation or a simple meal. Reflect upon your experiences and integrate the knowledge and power you've gained from Samael's energies.

Safety precautions:
- Always cast a protective circle before engaging in rituals involving Kliffotic energies or entities.
- Be respectfully cautious and polite when working with these entities.
- Make sure you have a good understanding of Kliffotic Kabbala before attempting this ritual.
