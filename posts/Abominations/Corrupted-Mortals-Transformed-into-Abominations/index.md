The correct answer is: Corrupted mortals drawn to forbidden powers that lead to physical and spiritual torment.

**Explanation**: Occult Abominations are creatures that are the result of corrupted mortals being drawn to forbidden powers that eventually lead to their physical and spiritual torment. There are multiple aspects to consider while exploring the rationale behind this conclusion.

1. In the study of the esoteric and occult, it is widely acknowledged that the desire for power and knowledge often leads practitioners to explore dangerous and forbidden territories. This intense drive to uncover hidden arcane secrets makes one susceptible to corruption, transforming their mind, spirit, and body as they delve deeper into these mysteries. This progression of corruption alters their essence, eventually leading to the formation of an Abomination.

2. Occult Abominations embody the consequences of the ultimate misuse of power. They serve as an illustration of the dire results that can arise when individuals abuse arcane knowledge and recklessly expand their own capabilities. As these once-human beings are drawn further into this realm of forbidden power, the natural order begins to break down, and irreversible consequences emerge.

3. Abominations are motivated by the same malevolent desires and motivations that led to their creation. Their behaviors and tendencies can be understood as a relentless continuation of the pursuit of power and the inflicted torment they experienced in their mortal lives. Their malevolent intentions and desire for chaos mirror the abyss they voluntarily embraced in their quest for forbidden knowledge.

Historically, Abominations have been referenced in various myths and folklore, which speak of individuals who succumb to darkness and ultimately transform into horrific creatures. These tales highlight the consequences of ignoring moral and ethical boundaries in the pursuit of personal gain and power.

In conclusion, understanding occult Abominations as corrupted mortals drawn to forbidden powers that lead to physical and spiritual torment is essential to comprehending their creation and behavior. This explanation provides a cautionary lesson for those seeking to explore the realm of the esoteric and occult, emphasizing the importance of respecting ethical boundaries and understanding the consequences of pursuing forbidden knowledge.
