In order to answer this knowledge challenge, we must first delve into the core concepts underlying the study of Abominations, occultism, and symbolism. To start, let's define the primary terms and explore their historical contexts, which will in turn enable us to better understand their significance and impact on human knowledge and perception of occultism.

An Abomination, within the context of esoteric and occult studies, is typically described as a supernatural or preternatural entity that is considered malevolent, grotesque or otherwise beyond the understanding of conventional human knowledge. In many cases, Abominations are believed to have originated from a darker or otherworldly energy, seemingly opposing the core human values and ideals. The symbolism and archetypes associated with Abominations are diverse, encompassing a variety of cultures, mythologies, and traditions throughout history.

Occultism, on the other hand, is a broad term that encompasses many different practices, including but not limited to, the study of hidden or mysterious knowledge, magic, alchemy, astrology, and spiritualism. This discipline often deals with understanding and working with concepts that remain unseen or inexplicable, with a goal to unlock the hidden truths of the universe and unlock the potential that lies within our own understanding.

Now that we have established these foundational concepts, we can investigate the relationship between the symbolic significance of an Abomination's origin and its manifestation in the world.

The manifestation of an Abomination within the physical or spiritual world carries with it a sort of symbolic resonance, which can be analyzed on several levels. For instance, an Abomination's physical manifestation may be described as the embodiment of human fears, anxieties, and the darkest aspects of the human psyche. In this sense, the form the Abomination takes is a reflection of our collective unconscious, giving shape to the repressed and unprocessed aspects of our minds.

In regards to the origin of the entity, the symbolic significance is inherently connected to its nature, often representing a distorted amalgamation of cultural, historical, and personal symbols. For instance, an Abomination may take on the qualities of a particular mythological figure or powerful archetype, embodying and perverting the qualities associated with these potent symbols in order to elicit a specific emotional or psychological response from those who encounter it.

The relationship between the symbolic origin of an Abomination and its manifestation in the world has a profound impact on human knowledge and perception of occultism. This can be observed in the manner with which the Abomination provokes fear, fascination, and a deep curiosity that drives individuals to seek to understand the nature of these entities and the forces that shape their existence.

Furthermore, the connection between the symbolism of an Abomination and its manifestation serves to illustrate the power of the human mind to create and transform reality, as our interpretation and perception of these phenomena play a crucial role in how we interact with and exert control over them. For the occult practitioner, understanding the connection between an Abomination's origin and its manifestation is essential for leverage over the entity, whether it be to bind, banish, or utilize its power for personal gain or the protection of others.

In conclusion, the relationship between the symbolic significance of an Abomination's origin and its manifestation in the world is one of great depth and complexity, reflecting the multifaceted nature of human knowledge and perception of occultism. Key themes underlying this connection include the embodiment of collective fears and anxieties, the perversion and manipulation of cultural and historical symbols, and the capacity of the human mind to convert abstract concepts into tangible forms. Ultimately, the study and comprehension of this connection serve not only to deepen our understanding of the dark and mysterious aspects of existence but also emphasizes the importance of confronting our own shadowy depths in order to grow and evolve both individually and as a collective.
