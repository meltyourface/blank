To fully address the given knowledge challenge, we must first identify various well-known Abominations throughout occult and esoteric history. Then, we will analyze their unique aspects and subsequently select a combination that forms a comprehensive allegory highlighting the inherent dangers facing humanity when dealing with extreme transgressions against natural, physical, and spiritual laws.

Well-Known Abominations:
1. **The Nephilim (Biblical)**: These are the offspring of angels and human women, representing the forbidden mixing of heavenly and worldly elements.
2. **Frankenstein's monster (literary)**: The creation of Dr. Victor Frankenstein by combining parts of different corpses; embodying the transgression of boundaries between life and death while questioning human hubris over scientific discovery.
3. **Cthulhu (Lovecraftian mythos)**: A cosmic entity that lies sleeping beneath the sea, Cthulhu represents chaos and madness, embodying the incomprehensible horrors of a universe humankind cannot possibly understand.
4. **The Golem (Jewish folklore)**: A humanoid figure created from clay or mud and brought to life through mystical rites, symbolizing the harnessing of divine creative power by a mortal.
5. **The Homunculus (Alchemical)**: An artificially created small human, representing humanity's attempt to possess the power of life creation.

Unique Aspects and Combination:
1. **The unconstrained combining of elements (Nephilim and Frankenstein's monster)**: This blending disregards the boundary separating the metaphysical from the physical world, leading to unintended, catastrophic consequences.
2. **The intrusion of cosmic horrors (Cthulhu)**: This brings forth incomprehensible threats that humankind is vastly unprepared to confront.
3. **The reckless pursuit of power (Golem and Homunculus)**: Unbridled attempts to attain divine, creative powers can result in disastrous repercussions.

Now that we have identified the unique aspects, we can form a comprehensive allegory highlighting the inherent dangers facing humanity when dealing with extreme transgressions against natural, physical, and spiritual laws. In this allegory, the Nephilim and Frankenstein's monster signifies the perils of blurring boundaries between the divine and mortal realms, whereas Cthulhu embodies the dangers of awakening unimaginable horrors hailing from the cosmos. The hubris showcased in the creation of the Golem and Homunculus serves to remind humankind of the inevitable disaster that will ensue upon meddling with divine forces.

In conclusion, the combination of unique aspects from the Nephilim, Frankensteinâ€™s monster, Cthulhu, Golem, and Homunculus collectively form a potent allegory that emphasizes the grave perils humanity faces when transgressing against the natural order, delving into the abyss of cosmic horrors, and attempting to gain divine powers. As the allegory teaches, crossing these boundaries without precautions could unleash consequences far beyond our comprehension and control, ultimately leading to catastrophe and existential threats to our very existence.
