Answering the Knowledge Challenge:

To provide a comprehensive answer to this complex knowledge challenge, we need to dissect it into its key components and address each of these individually. **The main components of the question are**:

1. The formation of an abomination through the amalgamation of celestial and infernal energies
2. The metaphysical alchemical process involved in its manifestation
3. The implications on esoteric morality
4. Cosmic balance considerations
5. Consequences for the individual practitioner

1) Formation of an Abomination:

Abominations are unique entities that result from the blending of both celestial and infernal energies. Celestial energies represent the divine, spiritual, and uplifting aspects of existence, whereas infernal energies encompass the darker, more sinister, destructive forces. These two seemingly incompatible energies combine to create a highly potent, powerful, and chaotic force that can manifest as an abomination. This fusion of energies can occur naturally, as a rare cosmic event, or artificially through powerfully esoteric rituals and practices carried out by skilled practitioners.

2) Metaphysical Alchemical Process:

The metaphysical alchemical process that leads to the manifestation of an abomination is complex and multidimensional. **It can be broken down into the following steps**:

a) Attraction: The practitioner must first attract and concentrate the celestial and infernal energies, drawing them from their respective planes or sources, such as angels, demons, spirits, or divine/infernal artifacts.

b) Preparation: To facilitate the merger of these opposing energies, the practitioner needs to establish an appropriate environment and mental state. This can involve creating a ritual space, employing specific symbols or talismans, chanting, meditation, or other techniques to open up channels that enable the energies to interact.

c) Fusion: The most critical step in the process, fusion refers to the forceful merging of the celestial and infernal energies to create a new entity - the abomination. The practitioner must use their own psychic or esoteric powers to harness these energies, guiding their interaction and synergistic fusion, and shaping the resulting entity's form and purpose.

d) Stabilization: After the fusion, the abomination's energy is volatile and unstable. It is important for the practitioner to stabilize this new entity, ensuring it doesn't disintegrate or pose a threat to the one who summoned it. Techniques to achieve this may include binding rituals, containment spells, or pacts in which the practitioner establishes a sense of order and control over the abomination.

3) Implications on Esoteric Morality:

The creation or control of an abomination raises several moral questions in the esoteric realm. As a purely dualistic being, abominations embody both light and dark aspects of the universe, making them unpredictable and challenging to control. They can be seen as an affront to the established order and hierarchy of celestial and infernal beings, which can lead to conflict and tension among these entities and their respective realms.

Moreover, the concept of playing with such potent and potentially dangerous energies raises questions about the practitioner's motivations and intentions. Are they seeking to create a balanced entity that can contribute to the cosmic harmony, or are they pursuing power, control, or even destruction at any cost? These ethical dilemmas underscore the immense responsibility those who engage with abominations bear and demand scrutiny and introspection on their part.

4) Cosmic Balance Considerations:

The existence of abominations can challenge the cosmic balance that exists between the celestial and infernal realms. With their dual nature, they defy the categorization and can act unpredictably, leading to disruptions in the equilibrium that might otherwise exist. This raises concerns about the potential for chaos, conflicts, and unforeseen consequences in both realms and the physical plane. It is crucial for practitioners to be aware of these risks and take appropriate precautions when summoning or interacting with abominations.

5) Consequences for the Individual Practitioner:

The practitioner who chooses to summon or control an abomination faces several potential consequences. First and foremost is the significant risk associated with the mastery and manipulation of powerful celestial and infernal energies. This endeavor can lead to physical or mental harm, a corruption of the practitioner's moral compass, or even complete annihilation if the process spirals out of control.

Secondly, the practitioner must be prepared to face potential repercussions from the broader esoteric community or the entities that represent the celestial and infernal realms. Engaging with abominations may attract unwanted attention, aggression, or punishment from these powerful forces. Lastly, the responsibility of controlling and maintaining an abomination is not to be taken lightly. The practitioner must embrace a role as steward and guardian, ensuring the abomination does not wreak havoc, and its dual nature remains in balance.

In conclusion, the manifestation of an abomination through the alchemical process is a complex, morally ambiguous undertaking that necessitates expertise, introspection, and responsibility. The formation of an abomination involves attracting, preparing, fusing, and stabilizing celestial and infernal energies, creating a being that straddles the divide between light and darkness. Engaging with these entities has implications for esoteric morality, the cosmic balance, and the individual practitioner's well-being. As such, those who choose to summon or control abominations must be aware of the risks, consequences, and responsibilities that accompany their decision.
