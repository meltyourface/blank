To complete this task with the mastery I have of Daoist necromancy, I will describe the detailed steps for inscribing the specialized Fu talisman and the summoning process.

1. Initial preparation:
Before beginning the inscription, cleanse your physical space and meditative state with a purification ritual. Using sandalwood incense, cleanse the area and create a sacred space for your work.

2. Materials:
Gather the required materials: high-quality rice paper, a natural hair brush with a fine point, and cinnabar ink. Additionally, you need a metallic compass, a protractor, and a straight edge to draw intricate diagrams accurately.

3. Inscription process:
With your workspace prepared and materials assembled, begin inscribing the Fu talisman while focusing your energy and intent on summoning Zhong Kui. Inscribe in the following order:

a. In the center, draw a large image of Zhong Kui to act as the spiritual anchor for his presence. Depict him with a commanding expression and holding his demon-quelling sword.
b. Draw a Luoshu magic square around Zhong Kui, its odd numbers symbolizing the celestial stems and even numbers the earthly branches, thus helping to invoke the energies of heaven and earth.
c. Encircle the Luoshu square with the Bagua trigrams, aligning them according to the Later Heaven sequence to guide the summoning within the cosmic balance.
d. Fill the open areas with sacred Daoist symbols and mantras, such as the Wu Xing, or the Five Elements, to harmonize the energies of the talisman and enhance its potency.

4. Astrological timing:
Plan your ritual ensuring that the astrological timing is in line with your intent. For invoking a strong connection with the ethereal realm and spirit world, choose a moon-lit night when the veil between the realms is thin, preferably during a Full Moon or when the Moon is in association with the Ghost Star (天璇) in the Chinese lunar mansion.

5. Summoning ritual:
a. Prepare a ritual altar, placing the inscribed Fu talisman at its center.
b. Arrange offerings such as fruits, rice, wine, and incense, focusing on those that hold meaning and connection to both Zhong Kui and the Daoist spiritual framework.
c. Light the specific ritual incense – preferably made from sandalwood, agarwood, or frankincense – to serve as an aid to open the gateway between realms.
d. Recite a Daoist invocation to summon Zhong Kui while focusing on the talisman and your intent.
e. Visualize a connection between yourself and the spirit guardian while maintaining a calm and controlled mind.
f. Once the ethereal presence of Zhong Kui is felt, you can communicate your intentions and ask for guidance and protection.

Be sure to perform your task respectfully and responsibly, following the principles of Daoist necromancy to maintain balance and harmony among the realms. Remember to express your gratitude and appreciation to Zhong Kui and the interconnected forces that aided your summoning before ending the ritual.
