To respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first establish the connections between the Tarot's Major Arcana, the Tree of Life's sephiroth, and the astrological symbols. Once these connections are made, we can analyze the specific elements mentioned (Pluto in Scorpio in the 8th house, and The Tower as the Tarot card of the year) to derive the essential lesson for an individual seeking spiritual growth through Occultism.

1. **Tarot's Major Arcana and the Tree of Life's sephiroth**:

The Tarot's Major Arcana is often connected to the Tree of Life's sephiroth through the Hermetic Qabalah. Each of the 22 cards corresponds to one of the 22 pathways connecting the 10 sephiroth. In this case, The Tower, which is the 16th card in the Major Arcana, corresponds to the 27th path connecting the 7th sephirah (Netzach, meaning 'Victory') with the 8th sephirah (Hod, meaning 'Glory').

2. **Astrological symbols and the sephiroth**:

The sephiroth are also associated with astrological symbols, specifically the planets and zodiac signs. Netzach is associated with the planet Venus and symbolizes love, beauty, and our emotional nature. Hod is associated with the planet Mercury and represents intellect, communication, and rational thinking.

3. **Analyzing the individual's birth chart**:

A conjunction of Pluto in Scorpio in the 8th house suggests a person with high energy and intensity, with a focus on transformation, regeneration, and the uncovering of hidden truths. Pluto is the planet of transformation and power, while Scorpio, ruled by Pluto and Mars, is a sign focused on intensity, emotions, and deep mysteries. The 8th house represents shared resources, the occult, and matters related to sex, death, and rebirth.

4. **Connecting The Tower to the individual's astrological aspects**:

The Tower is a card symbolizing sudden upheaval, destruction, revelation, and chaos. It indicates that the individual is going through, or will soon face, a significant event that will bring forth drastic change, shaking their foundation, and leading to an opportunity for personal and spiritual growth.

5. **Deriving the essential lesson**:

Taking into account the correspondences of The Tower with Netzach and Hod, and analyzing the astrological aspects, the essential lesson for an individual seeking spiritual growth through Occultism is related to balancing emotional intensity and rational thinking with transformative growth and upheaval. The Tower's connection to Netzach (Venus) reminds the individual to recognize and manage their emotional nature and its impact on the upcoming challenges, while Hod (Mercury) suggests that they must rely on intellect, communication, and rational thinking to navigate the upheaval.

Moreover, the Plutonian energy and the 8th house placement indicate that these challenges may involve a deep dive into the realms of the occult, with a focus on uncovering hidden truths, exploring transformative energies, and rebirthing oneself after the shaking of their foundation.

In conclusion, the essential lesson for this individual is to recognize the importance of balancing and integrating their emotional intensity and rational thinking in order to harness the transformative energy of Pluto in Scorpio and The Tower card. This will require them to face upheaval and destruction bravely while using the insights from the world of Occultism to grow and evolve both personally and spiritually. They must learn to navigate the realms of emotions and intellect, challenges and revelations, destruction and rebirth, ultimately moving towards higher spiritual realization and mastery of their inner self.
