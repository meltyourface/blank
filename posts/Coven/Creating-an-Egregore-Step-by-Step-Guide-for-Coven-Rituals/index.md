To begin the intricate process of crafting a shared group egregore within the Coven, follow these specific steps:

1. **Establishing a Common Objective**: The first step involves every member of the Coven coming together to define a clear and unified purpose for the creation of the egregore. This intent acts as a spiritual anchor for the group consciousness.

2. **Assigning Roles and Contributions**: Each member of the Coven will be assigned specific roles based on their abilities and expertise, such as leading rituals, drawing sigils, performing invocations, and meditating for synchronization.

3. **Crafting the Sigil or Symbol**: A unique sigil representing the egregore will be collaboratively designed by the Coven members, keeping in mind sacred geometry principles and any significant symbolism aligned with their collective intent.

4. **Ritual of Invocation**: The Coven will gather in a sacred space and perform a ritual to invoke the creation of the egregore. This may include chanting, rhythmic drumming, and recitation of mantras, all of which should align with the agreed-upon purpose.

5. **Synchronization of Group Consciousness**: Via deep meditation, guided visualization, or trance induction, the Coven members connect with each other on a psychic level to form a unified collective consciousness. This process is crucial for the successful formation and empowerment of the egregore.

6. **Astral Projection**: Experienced members of the Coven may utilize astral projection to explore the non-physical planes and guide the energies of the egregore towards its purpose. This enhances the potency of the egregore as it operates on both physical and astral levels.

7. **Lunar and Planetary Alignments**: To amplify the power of the egregore, rituals and invocations will be timed according to the most auspicious lunar and planetary alignments associated with the egregore's purpose.

8. **Regular Maintenance and Strengthening**: The egregore will require regular care and nourishment through subsequent rituals, meditations, and psychic energy contributions from the Coven members. This ensures the ongoing development and efficacy of the egregore.

9. **Manifestation of Intent**: Over time, as the egregore gradually gains power and strength, its influence will begin to manifest in accordance with the Covenâ€™s original intent. Members should remain vigilant for signs and omens that signify the fruition of their collective purpose.

10. **Dissolution or Restructuring**: Depending on the success or finality of the egregore's purpose, the Coven may decide to either dissolve the egregore by performing a closing ritual or to restructure it for a new objective by updating the sigil and revising the primary intent.

By following these intricate steps of crafting a shared group egregore within the Coven, practitioners can bolster their collective power to manifest their intention and influence their desired outcomes.
