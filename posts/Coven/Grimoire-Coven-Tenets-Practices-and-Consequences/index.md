## I. Sacred Tenets of the Coven

1. **The Principle of Harmony**: Coven members shall strive to maintain harmony within the natural world and the spiritual realm, aligning their actions with the cosmic balance.
2. **The Ethic of Consent**: Members shall respect the autonomy of all living beings, refraining from magical practices without the explicit, informed consent of those affected.
3. **The Virtue of Personal Responsibility**: Each member shall assume full responsibility for their magical actions and their consequences, both intended and unforeseen.
4. **The Philosophy of Knowledge**: Members commit to the pursual and preservation of esoteric wisdom and understanding, ensuring that such knowledge is only divulged to those who are sincerely dedicated and prepared for its weight.
5. **The Oath of Secrecy**: Coven members uphold trust within the coven by keeping all shared knowledge, experiences, and rituals strictly confidential, unless otherwise agreed upon collectively.

### II. Harnessing Elemental and Celestial Forces

1. Members shall only harness elemental and celestial forces in line with the sacred tenets, using them for the benefit of all and respecting their innate power and influence.
2. Invocation or manipulation of these forces must be done with clear intent, adequate preparation, and proper understanding to prevent misuse or unintended harm.
3. All energy work involving elemental and celestial forces must end with proper grounding and closure, returning the energies to their natural state and balance.

### III. Initiation Rituals, Rites of Passage, and Ceremonies

2. Rites of passage denote significant milestones on a coven member's spiritual journey, allowing for recognition, support, and celebration among peers.
3. Ceremonies unite the coven in the collective expression of gratitude, reverence, and growth, tailored to the unique needs and traditions of the coven.

### IV. Manipulation of Energy and Moral Implications

1. Members must use magic responsibly, ensuring that their actions align with the coven's ethical principles and avoiding undue harm or undue influence on others.
2. Reactive and detrimental magic, such as curses and hexes, must only be employed in cases of self-defense or rightful retaliation, avoiding escalation or unnecessary suffering.

### VI. Summoning and Conjuring Etiquette

1. All communication with otherworldly beings shall be approached with respect, sincerity, and due caution, understanding the power dynamics and potential consequences.
2. Summoning or conjuring should only be undertaken for purposes that align with the coven's sacred tenets and with the consent and willingness of the being in question.
