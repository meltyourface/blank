The Ritual of the Profound Metamorphosis within the Templum Falcis Cruentis tradition is an intricate ceremony that invokes powerful change on all levels of one's being. This transformation encompasses the physical, mental, and spiritual essence, and requires extensive knowledge of ancient sigils, arcane incantations, rare herbs, gemstones, and awareness of the lunar cycles. To undergo this metamorphosis, one must adhere to the following steps:

1. **Preparation of the Ritual Space**: Choose a location with minimal distractions and imbue it with sacred energy to amplify the potency of the ritual. Construct an altar adorned with an obsidian blade, a golden chalice, a ceremonial dagger, and the Sigil of Transformation – a serpent eating its tail (Ouroboros) surrounded by the seven symbols of the ancient alchemical transmutation.

2. **Selection of Appropriate Lunar Cycle**: The ritual is best performed during the Full Moon, when the moon's energy is at its peak, or on the New Moon, signifying new beginnings and transformation.

3. **Gathering of Herbs and Ingredients**: Acquire and prepare the following herbs: Mugwort, known for enhancing psychic abilities and spiritual vision; Mandrake, to tap into one's hidden power and offerings of protection; and Wormwood, as a catalyst for change and heightened awareness. Gather the necessary gemstones – Black Tourmaline, Moonstone, and Labradorite – to dictate the energy of the ritual.

4. **Crafting of Sigils**: The practitioner must create a personal sigil representing their intended metamorphosis by inscribing intricate symbols and arcane lettering that resonates with their desired transformation.

5. **Preparation of the Ritual Participants**: Before the ritual, participants must purify their bodies and minds through fasting, meditation, and ablution in consecrated water mixed with essential oils of Myrrh and Frankincense.

6. **The Ritual**:

a. Begin by casting a protective circle around the ritual space using the obsidian blade, invoking the powers of the elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) and directions (North, East, South, and West).

b. Light the corresponding colored candles (green, yellow, red, and blue) at each cardinal point and incense (preferably consisting of the prepared herbs) on the altar.

c. Recite the Invocation of the Profound Metamorphosis, a series of arcane chants in Latin, to summon the powerful spirits and energies necessary for the transformation.

d. Hold the ceremonial dagger and perform the "Blood Offering" by dripping a few drops of blood into the golden chalice, symbolizing the sacrifice and dedication necessary for true transformation.

e. Mix the prepared herbs and grind the gemstones into a fine powder, then add these ingredients to the chalice with the blood offering. Stirring counterclockwise, recite the Chant of Elemental Fusion, which binds the elements together.

f. Pour the ritual elixir onto the Sigil of Transformation drawn on a parchment, visualizing the desired metamorphosis while reciting the Mantra of Manifestation with utmost clarity and conviction.

g. Finally, when the ritual is complete, burn the parchment with the sigil and release its essence into the universe by tossing the ashes to the wind.

7. **Closing of the Ritual**: Thank the powers, spirits, and energies invoked in the ritual, snuff out the candles, and disperse the protective circle counterclockwise, sealing the energy within the practitioner.

As the days and nights pass following the ritual, focus the mind and spirit on the desired transformation, recognizing and embracing the subtle changes taking place. The metamorphosis may take time, but with dedication and persistence, the transformation will be profound and long-lasting.
