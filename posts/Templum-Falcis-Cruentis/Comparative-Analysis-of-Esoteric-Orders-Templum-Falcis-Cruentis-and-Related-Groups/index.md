Templum Falcis Cruentis, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis, and Cultus Sabbati are all esoteric orders dedicated to the study and practice of occult knowledge, magick, and mystical traditions. This comparative study aims to elucidate the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of each organization, focusing on their core beliefs, rituals, hierarchical structures, and historical origins.

1. **Templum Falcis Cruentis**:

At its core, Templum Falcis Cruentis is focused on the mastery of the hidden arts, alchemy, and esoteric knowledge. Its rituals are shrouded in secrecy, and only the most dedicated initiates are granted access to their inner workings. The hierarchical structure consists of a highly-selective ranking system, in which more experienced members guide the novices in their practice. One peculiar aspect of Templum Falcis Cruentis is its emphasis on blood magick, involving rituals focused on the sanctity of blood and life forces.

2. **The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn**:

Founded in the 19th century, the Golden Dawn is an occult order dedicated to the study of metaphysics, mysticism, alchemy, and theurgy. The group's rituals and practices are based on the Qabalistic Tree of Life, with initiates progressing through ten degrees, each corresponding to a sphere on the Tree. Golden Dawn's teachings are rooted in Hermeticism, astrology, and tarot. 

3. **Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)**:

OTO originated in the early 20th century as an offshoot of the Golden Dawn. Its teachings are primarily centered around the Law of Thelema, as formulated by Aleister Crowley. OTO's hierarchal structure consists of a series of degrees, borrowed from Freemasonry, where initiates advance through different levels of spiritual attainment. Thelema's guiding axiom "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" emphasizes individuality and self-discovery as vital components of its practice.

4. **Cultus Sabbati**:

Cultus Sabbati is a modern witchcraft tradition that draws heavily from historical accounts of European witchcraft, paganism, and folklore. Its emphasis is on the witches' sabbath, theurgy, and direct communion with spirits in the performance of their rituals. Due to its secretive nature, little information about Cultus Sabbati's structure is publicly available.

Comparison:

Templum Falcis Cruentis shares certain similarities with these esoteric orders. For instance, all groups exhibit a strong emphasis on secrecy and hidden knowledge, revealing their teachings only to dedicated initiates. Each has a hierarchical structure based on attained degrees, with experienced members guiding newcomers.

Differences between these orders are also notable. Templum Falcis Cruentis focuses on blood magick, setting it apart from other traditions. The Golden Dawn's focus on Hermeticism and Qabalah makes it distinct from the Thelemic principles of the OTO, while Cultus Sabbati's roots in folklore and witchcraft differentiate it from both.

Conclusion:

While each organization has its unique aspects and magickal practices, their shared emphasis on self-discovery, initiation, and secrecy highlights the human longing for understanding and mastery of the unknown. Such differences stem from the distinct historical origins, influences, and focuses of each group. Templum Falcis Cruentis, for its part, stands out due to its emphasis on the sanctity of blood and deep-rooted esotericism, providing a unique perspective on occultism within the realm of magick.
