To thoroughly respond to the knowledge challenge presented, it is essential to first describe the Parable of the Sower as found in the synoptic Gospels, followed by a detailed analysis of the three layers of meaning. Finally, connections will be made to exoteric, esoteric, and mesoteric interpretations, and the symbolism of numerology, alchemy, and the Qabalistic Tree of Life will be incorporated.

The Parable of the Sower is a teaching of Jesus Christ, found in the synoptic Gospels of Matthew (13:1-9), Mark (4:1-9), and Luke (8:4-8). The parable describes a sower who casts seeds on various types of terrains, including the wayside, rocky ground, thorny ground, and good soil. The seeds' growth and ultimate yield vary depending on the terrain. Jesus later explains the meaning of the parable to his disciples, equating the seeds to the word of God and the terrains to different types of individuals who receive the message.

1. **Exoteric Interpretation (first layer)**: 
The exoteric interpretation of the Parable of the Sower is the most apparent and straightforward meaning. At its surface, the parable describes how people receiving the word of God may exhibit various responses.

- Wayside: Represents those who hear the word of God but do not understand or internalize the message. The words are quickly "eaten" by the "birds" (temptations and evil influences), leading to no spiritual growth.
- Rocky ground: Denotes individuals who initially receive the word with enthusiasm but do not develop deep roots. When faced with challenges and persecution, their faith quickly withers away.
- Thorny ground: Embodies individuals who may initially accept the word but soon become consumed by worldly desires and distractions, hindering their spiritual growth.
- Good soil: Represents those who genuinely hear the word of God, internalize it, and cultivate spiritual growth, ultimately producing abundant fruits (actions and deeds).

This outer layer of meaning serves as a moral and spiritual lesson for believers, encouraging them to prepare themselves as fertile ground for the Word to take root and produce positive results in their lives.

2. **Esoteric Interpretation (second layer)**:
The esoteric interpretation relates to the hidden and secretive aspects of the parable, veiled to all but the most advanced spiritual initiates and seekers.

- Numerology: The number four (four types of grounds) symbolizes wholeness, stability, and solid foundations. In this context, the parable may represent the stages of an individual's inner journey to wholeness and enlightenment.
- Alchemy: Corresponding to the alchemical stages (nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, and rubedo), the grounds represent stages of spiritual transformation: dissolution, purification, enlightenment, and integration/union with the divine.

3. **Mesoteric Interpretation (third layer)**:
The mesoteric interpretation symbolically bridges the exoteric and esoteric layers for initiates undergoing spiritual growth.

- Qabalistic Tree of Life: The grounds correspond to the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. Wayside is Malkuth (Kingdom), Rocky Ground is Yesod (Foundation), Thorny Ground is Tiferet (Beauty), and Good Soil is Keter (Crown). The stages of human consciousness shift from material attachment to divine consciousness.
- The parable's message aids initiates in spiritual growth by encouraging self-examination, purification, and inner transformation.

In summary, the Parable of the Sower offers three distinct layers of meaning. The exoteric interpretation provides a moral and ethical lesson for believers. The esoteric interpretation gives insight into the deeper mysteries of spiritual transformation, incorporating numerology and alchemy. The mesoteric interpretation serves as a bridge between these two layers for those engaging in spiritual growth, incorporating the symbolism of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Overall, the Parable of the Sower teaches its followers the importance of cultivating fertile ground within themselves to nourish their spiritual growth in the quest for enlightenment.
