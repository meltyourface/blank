In San Veneficio's meandering gloom,
Where Father Dis ascends the tainted throne,
And Dead Thurn prey on chambers of their tomb,
To unseen realms the whispering winds are blown.

The maledict procession of the stars,
In serpentine and ashen shrouds they dance,
Their silver tongues through lattice windows gnarl,
And wreathe the sleeping minds in sick'ning trance.

Unraveling, a spectral thoroughfare,
Of garbled tongues and clawing at the black,
Do legions unsought, from rifts unbidden fare,
And rend the veil of truth — surrender, slack.

These sorrows borne by Argentrum, unnamed,
No hand may rest upon a shoulder cold,
His sanguine sign creeps ever-scarlet stained,
As through bewildered bramble paths he's strolled.

Veiled by the loamy shroud of twisted root,
Luciana's visage stirs the stagnant air,
Her whisper — secret musings underfoot,
Like tendrils snake, and pull without a care.

In shadows deep, sinister, abstract forms,
The Augenwal — betrayer of the light,
Their stony hearts know not the moral norms,
Their will unfolds, as night devours the bright.

At Pan Antiphon's eldritch, gnarled door,
Lost languages release their buried truth,
The veil between the pulsing worlds is tore,
As chasm yawns beneath unearthly truth.

De Wha's lament, in lamentable sighs,
Like dirges echo, chilling to the soul,
Their secrets spoken in the gaze of eyes,
No bonds of flesh to bind, confine, or hold.

In tempest spiraling of ink-black sea,
Leviathan awaits, in abysmal night,
His jaws unhinged with hunger to be seen,
By those who seek his sub-rosa delight.

Speak not the name — hushed shiver upon lips,
Whose breath is silence, sharp as frozen sky,
Too late retreat, his barbed tendrils grip,
The end concealed in madness, only sighs.

Exhale this tale and cast upon the breeze,
In San Veneficio's cradling dark,
Let not the specter's breath within you seize,
Lest these realms unseen engorge and mark.
