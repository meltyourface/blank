To thoroughly analyze the metaphysical undercurrents and recurring motifs in Michael Cisco's writing, particularly in his novels "The Divinity Student" and "Animal Money," it is crucial to first understand the broader context of esotericism and its influence on the perception of reality. Esotericism, as a field of study and practice, delves into the mystical and mysterious aspects of reality, exploring hidden truths, symbolism, and the interconnection between the physical and metaphysical realms. This engagement with alternative realities and hidden aspects of existence markedly characterizes Cisco's literary works, making it essential to explore such themes in detail.

In "The Divinity Student," we encounter a protagonist who is struck dead by lightning and subsequently resurrected by a mysterious figure known as the "Desmodus," in order to complete a task of assembling a secret dictionary. Throughout the narrative, Cisco repeatedly invokes the theme of liminality, or the state of being on the threshold between two different realities—a defining characteristic of esoteric thought. The Divinity Student himself exists in an in-between state, being neither dead nor alive, and firmly occupying this liminal space, much like an initiate into the esoteric mysteries. His connection to the metaphysical realms through the lightning strike further supports this notion.

Cisco also integrates other metaphysical elements in "The Divinity Student," such as the use of occult symbolism. For instance, the act of assembling the secret dictionary serves as a metaphor for piecing together hidden or forbidden knowledge, a common theme in esoteric studies. Furthermore, the novel delves into themes of language and communication with the supernatural, as the divinity student progressively unravels the encoded meanings found within the words of the dictionary that bridge the gap between the mundane and the divine.

In "Animal Money," Cisco continues to experiment with the themes of liminality and transformation, but he also introduces the concept of the "hyperobject"—a term coined by philosopher Timothy Morton to describe objects that are vast and complex, encompassing multiple dimensions and encompassing human understanding. In the novel, the hyperobject manifests as "Animal Money", an enigmatic and malevolent currency that comes to life. Cisco uses this concept to explore the mysterious and occult forces that govern our social and economic systems, painting a vivid allegory of the world's undercurrents that exist beyond human comprehension.

Likewise, in "Animal Money," Cisco delves into the notion of chaos and order, another prevalent theme in esotericism. The chaotic structure of the novel, with its disjointed narrative and abrupt shifts in perspective, mirrors the ways in which chaos gives way to order in the esoteric understanding of the world. This chaotic approach to storytelling reflects the concept of navigating the complex and obscure terrains of reality as the characters in the story attempt to understand the underlying mechanics that drive the events unfolding around them.

To summarize, the recurring metaphysical undercurrents and motifs in Michael Cisco's writing, particularly in his novels "The Divinity Student" and "Animal Money," reflect various aspects of esotericism, such as the liminal spaces between life and death, the construction of hidden or forbidden knowledge, and the navigation of occult forces within the natural world. Cisco's exploration of these themes adds depth and complexity to his literary works, offering readers an engaging and thought-provoking inquiry into the intersection of the esoteric and the mundane. Additionally, the correlation of these themes with the study of esotericism profoundly impacts the reader's perception of reality, inviting them to consider complex and hidden layers of existence that expand beyond conventional limits of understanding.
