Michael Cisco, renowned for his work in the weird fiction genre, has produced an impressive array of novels, short stories, and essays that testify to his erudition and mastery of the esoteric and occult.

### I. Pre-Divinity Period

1. **Early Essays & Short Stories (1990 - 1998)**:
   This period saw Cisco exploring themes of human isolation, alienation, and the intersection of otherworldly forces. His stylistic approach was heavily influenced by surrealist writers and classic horror authors such as H.P. Lovecraft and Algernon Blackwood.

### II. The Divinity Student Era (1999 - 2003)

1. The Divinity Student (1999) - A powerful introduction to the world of Michael Cisco, this novel established the author's ability to merge surrealism, horror, and metaphysical exploration. Here, readers are introduced to the titular protagonist, a deceased student who seeks lost words and meanings in the eerie realm of the divine.

2. The Golem (2003) - In this short novel, Cisco delves deeper into the interplay of chthonic and spiritual being, using the figure of the golem as a metaphor for the human's struggle against cosmic insignificance. The novel's structure demonstrates a maturation in Cisco's narrative techniques, employing non-linear storytelling and multiple perspectives.

### III. The San Veneficio Canon Period (2004-2007)

1. The San Veneficio Canon (2004) – Comprised of The Divinity Student and The Golem, this anthology highlights the interconnectivity between Cisco’s early works, laying the groundwork for the cosmic universe that he would continue to develop throughout his writing career.

2. Short Stories and Essays of this Period - Expanding upon his previous themes, the short stories and essays from this era combine surrealism, horror, and the strange with the growing universe of San Veneficio.

### IV. **The Narrator**: Cosmic Alignments (2007)

1. The Narrator (2007) - This groundbreaking work distances itself from the realm of San Veneficio, opening with a new focus on war, morality, and the human condition. The cosmic elements emerge later in the narrative, creating an intricate web connecting the characters to the environment and the wider metaphysical web of the esoteric universe.

### V. Unifying the Occult through Literature (2008 - Present)

1. The Great Lover (2011) - With this novel, Cisco explores carnal love and spiritual communion with supernatural beings. Books manifested as sentient entities and spiritual alchemy are brought to the forefront, further cementing the interplay of the esoteric and the mundane.

2. Celebrant (2012) - This work delves into the world of dreams and consciousness, merging the waking and dream worlds through the experiences of protagonist DeKlend.
