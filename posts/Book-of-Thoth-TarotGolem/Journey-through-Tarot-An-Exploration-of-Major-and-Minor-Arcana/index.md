In the shadows of the ancient temple's gaze,
Where secrets dwell and mystic powers blaze,
A quest commences, drawn from Tarot's maze,
The Book of Thoth, its wisdom may amaze.

The Major and Minor Arcana entwined,
Two threads of fate, together they are twined,
As spirits rise from depths of matter's bind,
A sacred tale of growth, the cards remind.

The Fool embarks upon his journey, blind,
As solar chariot wields the Chariot's drive,
With willpower surges forth the Priestess' mind,
To guide the soul's ascent where truth resides.

From Cups to Wands, Swords, and Pentacle heard,
The Minor's path through elements conferred,
These tales of strife and triumph interred,
Shall form the chaptered journey well inferred.

Five cards step forth, their secrets to reveal,
With symbols thick, deep mysteries they conceal,
Intermixed across life's great, cosmic wheel,
Their secrets thus in orbicular spiel.

Strength, tamed lion, faces challenge ahead,
Awakening paths of virtues fueled by red,
The Hanged Man inverted, worlds in dread,
Yet sacrifice its boon, enlightens heads.

The Lovers, dyad, kinship, choices spun,
A divine union, energies become one,
Four of Pentacles, mastery near won,
Foundation laid, in earthly riches sung.

Nine of Cups, emotions' wishes gained,
Arcadian joy where satisfaction reigned,
The Tower rends, its shattering unchained,
A sudden fall, old structures wiped and drained.

Through strength and strife, with love and loss in hand,
The web unravels to reveal life's grand plan,
Upon the edge, we tread the course and stand,
Tarot's wisdom weaving tapestry's expand.

In this story of soul's journey and flight,
Major and Minor Arcana unite,
Their mysteries concealed deep out of sight,
Awakening to the enlightened light.
