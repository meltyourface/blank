To address the knowledge challenge at hand, we will first examine Nietzsche's concept of "slave morality" in detail and then delve into gnostic beliefs concerning spiritual liberation through self-awareness. Afterward, we will analyze and explore their convergence in the pursuit of enlightenment by unveiling the obscured aspects of the human condition. By understanding the philosophical underpinnings of both ideas, we will find commonalities in their fundamental goals and objectives.

Friedrich Nietzsche was a 19th-century German philosopher known for his critiques of traditional philosophical and religious systems. One of his key ideas is the concept of "slave morality," which is closely associated with his theories on "master morality" and "will to power." Nietzsche believes that every society is divided into two groups: masters, those who hold power and control; and slaves, those who are subjugated and oppressed. Slave morality is a set of values, beliefs, and behaviors that the oppressed people adopt as a reaction to the impositions of the more powerful class.

The primary feature of slave morality is its emphasis on the virtues of compassion, humility, and empathy which are seen as positive traits for dealing with suffering and inequality. In this sense, good and evil are defined in relation to the experiences of the oppressed. Nietzsche argues that slave morality is based on resentment towards the masters or the powerful class, and it encourages a passive acceptance of suffering and powerlessness. This is in direct contrast with "master morality," which focuses on the pursuit of power and dominance, with traits like strength, ambition, and confidence being highly valued.

Now, let us shift our attention to the gnostic belief of spiritual liberation through self-awareness. Gnosticism is a diverse set of spiritual beliefs, systems, and modalities that emphasize direct, personal experience with the divine or absolute reality. The gnostic worldview posits that an individual's true essence is pure consciousness or spirit, and has become ensnared within the material world. Central to gnosticism is the attainment of self-awareness or self-knowledge, which enables the individual to see through illusions of material existence and attain spiritual liberation.

While Nietzsche's slave morality and the gnostic pursuit of spiritual liberation through self-awareness may seem to be at odds, there are points of intersection in their pursuit of enlightenment by unveiling the obscured aspects of the human condition. Both ideologies seek to expose the hidden dynamics beneath the surface that govern human behavior, aiming to subvert and overcome oppressive systems. 

For Nietzsche, the transcendence of slave morality can be achieved through the recognition and cultivation of one's will to power, enabling individuals to break free from the confines of resentment and embrace more authentic, self-actualizing values. Similarly, in the gnostic tradition, spiritual liberation is achieved by understanding the illusory nature of the material world and recognizing the divine spark within oneself, which results in transcending material limitations and bondage.

In both cases, the key to breaking free from oppression lies in self-knowledge and self-awareness. For Nietzsche, understanding one's will to power can potentially open pathways to self-overcoming and the creation of more authentic and life-affirming values. In the gnostic context, the attainment of gnosis or knowledge of one's true self can enable the individual to escape the enslavement of their material existence and reclaim their innate spiritual sovereignty.

In conclusion, Nietzsche's concept of slave morality and the gnostic belief of spiritual liberation through self-awareness, while seemingly disparate ideologies, share a common theme of unveiling the obscured aspects of human experience to achieve a more enlightened state of being. By attaining self-knowledge and seeking clarity beyond the illusory constructs of power dynamics and material existence, both ideologies emphasize the individual's potential for transcendence and liberation. While their methods and focuses may differ, their ultimate goals converge upon the pursuit of understanding and transformation that arises from the depths of human cognition and experience.
