As an adept Conjuror, I grasp the weight of the task at hand and proceed to gather all the necessary components needed to perform an elaborate banishing ritual. I search for a suitable environment, ideally one with consecrated grounds, such as an old secluded temple or a sacred grove.

Upon arriving at an appropriate location, I begin by cleansing myself, both physically and spiritually, to ensure that no external forces interfere with the ritual. This is done through a series of purifications, including bathing in a mixture of saltwater and sacred herbs.

Next, I gather the key consecrated tools required for the banishing ritual. These consist of:

1. A ceremonial dagger, blessed by a high priest or priestess
2. A chalice filled with consecrated water
3. A censer with burning incense, preferably composed of frankincense, myrrh, and sage
4. A pentacle inscribed with ancient symbols of power and protection
5. A wand crafted from the wood of a tree struck by lightning

Furthermore, I prepare the sacred space by drawing a large circle using chalk, salt, or another substance to mark the boundaries. Within this circle, I place five candles in the formation of a pentagram, representing the five elements—earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. 

Carefully, I inscribe various potent sigils within the circle. These sigils include:

1. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) sigil, to create a space protected from negative influences
2. The Sigil of Archangel Michael, to summon the powerful entity for protection and guidance
3. The Seal of Solomon, to control and repel any malevolent spirits

Afterwards, I begin the verbal incantation, whispered in an ancient language long forgotten by many. This incantation beseeches the presence of powerful deities and guardian spirits to bolster the strength of the ritual. 

I wield the ceremonial dagger and trace the sigils in the air while reciting the sacred words. Then, using the remaining consecrated tools, I perform the following sequence:

1. Sprinkle the consecrated water upon all corners of the sacred space to purify the atmosphere.
2. Pass the burning incense through the space to cleanse the air of any lingering impurities.
3. Lay the pentacle in the center and tap it thrice with the wand, creating a ripple of protective energy.
4. Raise the chalice to the sky, beseeching the higher powers for long-lasting protection from future negativity.

As I complete the ritual, I feel the palpable shift in the energy of the area—now filled with a protective and cleansing aura. I close out the ceremony by sealing the circle and expressing gratitude to the entities called forth for their assistance.

The meticulous execution of this banishing ritual ensures the successful expulsion of negative energies, malevolent spirits, curses, and astral parasites. In turn, it establishes long-lasting protection from future negativity, allowing for a newly consecrated area that promotes positivity and spiritual growth.
