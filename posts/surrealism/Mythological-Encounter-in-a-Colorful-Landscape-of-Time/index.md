  In response to the knowledge challenge at hand, let's first establish what a surrealistic landscape is and how time can be conveyed through color. Then, we will delve into the creation of a mythological story within the landscape, involving renowned figures from various spiritual traditions.
  
  Surrealism is an artistic and cultural movement that originated in the early 20th century. It seeks to unleash and explore the irrational forces and subconscious mind that exist beneath the surface of everyday reality. Surrealistic works are characterized by their dream-like, fanciful nature, where reality and fantasy intersect fluidly.
  
  To create a surrealistic landscape in which time is conveyed through color, imagine a world where the passage of time is not marked by the rotation of celestial bodies or the ticking of a clock, but instead by the seamless change of colors that permeate the environment. Dawn arrives with a warm, deep red hue that gradually melds into a bright yellow as morning approaches. As the day progresses, the landscape takes on varying shades of blue, gradually darkening until it reaches a deep indigo representing the night. This never-ending cycle of shifting colors represents the eternal nature of time.
  
  Now, let us consider a mythological story set within this surrealistic landscape, involving renowned figures from different spiritual traditions. In this tale, the changing colors of time have imbued the landscape with unique properties leading to the convergence of spiritual beings from various pantheons and realities. Each deity or mythical figure becomes aware of their interactions with other divine beings, allowing for an exchange of ideas, teachings and even conflicts.
  
  For example, the ancient Greek god of time, Chronos, feels drawn to this landscape, due to the way time manifests itself through color. As he explores this world, he encounters Kali, the Hindu goddess of time, creation, and destruction. The two deities engage in a enlightening discourse, exchanging knowledge and insights they have gained from their own experiences related to the passage of time and its influence on life and existence.
  
  Meanwhile, Ra, the Egyptian sun god, is intrigued by how the landscape changes color throughout the day, as his own domain involves the cycle of day and night, as well as the movement of the sun across the sky. This leads him to engage in a conversation with Coyolxauhqui, the Aztec moon goddess, where they discuss the necessity of a balance between light and darkness, as well as the role they each play in the life cycle.
  
  Over time, more spiritual figures are drawn to this surrealistic landscape, leading to a mythological tapestry woven from the encounters and interactions of divine beings. This leads to an epic narrative where they learn from one another, challenge each other, and eventually take back the wisdom and understanding they have gained to their own realms, ultimately influencing the beliefs and tales of their respective cultures.
  
  To summarize, this surrealistic landscape where time is conveyed through color serves as a unique framework for a mythological story. The environment becomes a melting pot of diverse spiritual traditions, where renowned figures from mythology engage in fascinating exchanges and form unlikely alliances or conflicts, enriching and broadening their own understanding and - by extension - that of the cultures that they are a part of. The world presented here creates a space for the exploration of deep, universal truths and the power of myth and spirituality, transcending the boundaries that separate the myriad realities and belief systems.
