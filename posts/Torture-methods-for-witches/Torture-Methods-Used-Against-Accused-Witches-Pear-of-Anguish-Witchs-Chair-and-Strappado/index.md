1. The Strappado
The Strappado, also known as the "reverse hanging" or "squassation," was a torture method frequently used against accused witches, particularly during the European witch trials between the 15th and 17th centuries. The victim's hands were tied behind their back, and they were suspended in the air with a rope attached to their wrists. Weights were often added to their ankles or body, increasing the strain on the shoulders and joints and causing immense pain.

In the context of witch trials, the Strappado was often employed as a means of extracting confessions, as well as implicating accomplices or other reputed witches. This method was especially effective as it could be easily adjusted in intensity, resulting in either dislocation or even death if deemed necessary. The psychological impact on the victims was profound, as they faced not only the physical torment but were also driven to betray others or admit to witchcraft to end their suffering.

Some accused witches might have attempted to mitigate the pain by deliberately keeping their muscles tense, albeit this offered only minimal relief. Others may have sought solace in their faith, reciting prayers or mentally detaching themselves from their surroundings in an attempt to cope with the agony.

2. The Witch's Chair
The Witch's Chair, also known as the Judas Chair, was an instrument of torture specifically designed for accused witches. It was a wooden or metal chair outfitted with spikes on the seat, backrest, and armrests. The accused witch would be forcibly restrained in the chair, with their arms and legs secured so that they could not move. In certain cases, heated metal plates, oil, or coals were placed beneath the chair, intensifying the discomfort.

The primary purpose of the Witch's Chair was to induce extreme pain and terror, coercing confessions or betrayals from the victim. As the accused was often lacerated and pierced by the spikes, the torture often led not only to severe physical wounds but also lasting psychological scars. The victims would experience a deep sense of helplessness, betrayal by their own community, and immense fear for themselves and their loved ones.

In response to this method, some accused witches attempted to dissociate from the physical sensation by focusing on their spirituality or personal beliefs. Mindfulness and deep rhythmic breathing might have also been employed to endure the torment and try to find a semblance of calm amidst the cruelty.

3. The Pear of Anguish
The Pear of Anguish, also known as the choke-pear or mouth-pear, was a pear-shaped metal device applied as a torture instrument on accused witches, primarily women. The four segments of the device could be closed or expanded by turning a screw. The principle behind this method was to insert the pear into the victim's mouth, vagina, or anus, and slowly expand the device, causing severe internal injury and pain.

Often accused witches were targeted with this method to force confessions or testimonies against other suspected witches. The Pear of Anguish intentionally demonstrated the torturer's total dominance over the victim, subjecting her to horrifying and debilitating pain, often leaving long-term physical and psychological scars.

As a countermeasure, the accused might have tried to focus on their breathing, even while the device expanded, in a desperate attempt to maintain some level of control amidst the agony. Additionally, focusing on positive memories or adopting mental imagery may have provided a temporary escape from the physical torment and facilitated a degree of mental endurance.

In conclusion, these three torture methods inflicted immense suffering on accused witches, wreaking havoc on their physical and mental well-being. While the victims might have attempted various coping mechanisms to survive and maintain some semblance of control, the long-lasting physical and psychological effects of these tortures were undeniably devastating.
