## The Rite of Safe Passage with the Guidance of Hermes

Introduction:
The Rite of Safe Passage is a ritual dedicated to Hermes, the ancient Greek god of travelers, boundaries, transitions, and communication. Hermes is known for guiding travelers safely on their journeys, ensuring their protection from harm, and blessing them with a swift and expedient path. By invoking the powers of Hermes and the Homeric Hymns, the ritual affirms the deity's guidance, seeks divine intercession, and cultivates an atmosphere of reverenceâ€”providing the traveler with protection and confidence as they embark.

Materials required:
1. A statue or image of Hermes
2. A small bowl of honey
3. A cup of wine or grape juice
4. An oil lamp or candle
5. Incense (preferably frankincense or myrrh)
6. A small pile of stones
**Step 1**: Preparation
1.1. Set up an altar on a table or flat surface in a quiet and dedicated space.
1.2. Place the statue or image of Hermes at the center of the altar.
1.3. Position the honey, wine, oil lamp, incense, and stones around the statue.
**Step 2**: Cleansing and invocation
2.1. Light the oil lamp and incense as an offering to Hermes.
2.2. Purify the space by walking around the altar clockwise with the incense, saying:

"Hermes, god of the sacred boundaries, may this offering cleanse and sanctify this space for your presence."
**Step 3**: Prelude
3.1. **Stand before the altar with your hands outstretched and recite the Homeric Hymn to Hermes (Hymn 4)**:

"Hermes, draw near, and to my prayer incline, messenger of Zeus, and Maia's son divine;
Prefect of contests, ruler of mankind, with heart almighty, and a prudent mind."
**Step 4**: Petition for guidance and protection
4.1. Pour a bit of honey and wine into the small bowl as an offering, saying:

"Hermes, guide of travelers and protector of boundaries, I offer you this honey and wine, sweet and fragrant, as a token of my reverence and gratitude. Watch over me, swiftly guide my steps, and shield me from harm on my journey."
**Step 5**: Stone offerings
5.1. **Hold the stones in your hands and recite**:

"Hermes, patron of wayfarers and guardian of paths, I offer these stones to mark my passage. May they stand as a testament of your guidance and support."

5.2. Arrange the stones at the base of the Hermes statue or image in a pile, imitating the herms (boundary markers) used in ancient Greece in honor of Hermes.
**Step 6**: Closing invocation and blessing
6.1. **Raise your hands above your head and recite**:

"Oh Hermes of the golden wand, graciously accept these offerings and words. Grant me your guiding hand and shield as I embark on my journey. I thank you, and I honor you. May your divine presence be with me, and may I know your protection in tempore periculoso."
**Step 7**: Final reflections and extinguishing of the lamp
7.1. Take a few moments to meditate on the ritual, focusing on the hope for safe travels ahead.
7.2. Extinguish the oil lamp and incense, knowing that Hermes, the divine traveler, has heard your prayers and ritually granted you safe passage.

By completing this rite with sincerity and reverence, the traveler has invoked the divine power of Hermes and sought his guidance and protection for the duration of the journey.
