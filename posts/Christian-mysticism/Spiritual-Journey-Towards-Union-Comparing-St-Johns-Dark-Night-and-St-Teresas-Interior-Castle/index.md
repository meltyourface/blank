When comparing St. **John of the Cross's "Dark Night of the Soul" and St. Teresa of Avila's "Interior Castle," it is essential to understand that both mystics were Spanish Carmelites from the sixteenth century who experienced deep spiritual trials and ecstasies while seeking union with God. Although each text possesses a unique perspective and terminology, they share a common goal**: the complete purification and transformation of the soul in its journey toward God.

To accurately analyze the similarities and differences between these two works, we need to clarify the key concepts of purgation, illumination, and union:

1. **Purgation**: This is the process of cleansing and purifying the soul from its attachments to material and worldly objects, allowing it to focus solely on God. 
2. **Illumination**: Following purgation, the purified soul begins to perceive divine light and wisdom, gaining insights into the mysteries of God and the spiritual life.
3. **Union**: As the culmination of the mystic journey, union represents the merging of the soul with God, experiencing perfect love and divine oneness.

In "Dark Night of the Soul," St. John of the Cross employs a two-fold division of the spiritual path, dividing the process of purgation into a "night of sense" and a "night of spirit." The "night of sense" involves detaching from sensory experiences and the material world, while the "night of spirit" refers to purgation of the deeper aspects of the soul. This purification process is often experienced as a painful and disorienting darkness, as the soul is stripped of its previous understanding and comforts. Once the dual purgation is completed, the soul enters into the illuminative stage, symbolized by the dawn that is to rise after the dark night. Finally, the soul reaches union with God, described as a transformation and union with the divine essence, resembling the spiritual marriage of the soul and God.

St. Teresa of Avila's "Interior Castle" presents the spiritual journey as a progression through seven dwelling places or mansions within a castle, with each mansion representing a successive stage in the soul's quest for union with God. Here, the process of purgation is depicted as the soul's movement through the first three mansions, involving detachment from worldly desires, meditation, self-knowledge, humility, and an increased awareness of God's presence. The process of illumination occurs within the fourth and fifth mansions, as the soul experiences spiritual consolations, profound understanding, rapture, and divine visions. Finally, the sixth and seventh mansions represent the soul's ultimate union with God, culminating in the spiritual marriage and mystical ecstasy, wherein the soul and God become one.

Both texts use rich symbolism and allegory to depict the mystical experiences, further illustrating the interconnectedness of purgation, illumination, and union. The dark night in St. John's work stands as a symbol of the soul's deprivation of worldly comforts and its ultimate dependence on divine grace and guidance. Meanwhile, St. Teresa's castle signifies the soul's inner sanctum, a divine abode within oneself where the soul encounters God. Both mystics explore different episodes of heightened spiritual experiences (e.g., visions, raptures, ecstasies) during the illuminative stages of their respective texts.

In conclusion, the accounts of St. **John of the Cross's "Dark Night of the Soul" and St. Teresa of Avila's "Interior Castle" share common elements in their depictions of the soul's journey through purgation, illumination, and union. Both mystics emphasize the necessity of self-renunciation, detachment, and dependence on divine grace while undergoing intensive purification processes. Although their specific metaphors and structuring of the stages vary, the ultimate goal remains the same**: total union with God and the transformation of the soul into a vessel for divine love and wisdom.
