Necromancers and practitioners focusing on the domain of the dead that walk are individuals who dedicate their lives to mastering the dark arts, specifically conjuring, controlling, and communicating with the reanimated dead. The following profile will delve into the main characteristics, motives, backgrounds, and emotional disposition of these individuals.

### II. Motives and Personality Traits

1. Power-seeking: Necromancers often desire control, dominance, and authority over others. By mastering the ability to manipulate undead beings, they feel empowered and gain a sense of superiority over both the living and the dead.

2. Curiosity and fascination: These practitioners may have an innate fascination with death and the unknown aspects of the afterlife. Delving into the domain of the dead that walk allows them to push the boundaries of the conventional understanding of life and explore uncharted territories.

3. Fear of death or loss: Necromancers may have experienced the painful loss of a loved one and are driven by the desire to reconnect with the departed or the fear of facing death themselves.

4. Societal outcasts: Practitioners of the dark arts, particularly necromancers, are often misfits or outcasts who feel alienated from mainstream society. They may develop an affinity for the company of the dead as a way to cope with their loneliness.

### III. Background Influences

1. Childhood experiences: Necromancers may have experienced early exposure to death or related concepts, leading them to become comfortable with or drawn to the subject. They might have grown up in a family with a history of witchcraft, folklore, or occult practices passed down through generations.

2. Societal influences: Societal attitudes towards death and the undead may have shaped necromancers' interest in these subjects. For example, in a culture that fears or demonizes the undead, an individual may be more inclined to study and seek control over the dead that walk to counteract such fears.

3. Emotional tendencies: Specific emotional experiences or traumas, such as grief, loss, or abandonment, can be significant factors drawing an individual towards necromancy as a means of coping or regaining control over their emotions.

### IV. Ethical Dilemmas and Mental Health

1. Ethical dilemmas: Necromancers may face moral conflicts and guilt associated with controlling and manipulating the dead since tampering with the natural order of life and death can be perceived as morally ambiguous or outright unethical. They may also struggle with issues related to consent when raising or interacting with the dead.

2. Mental health: Practitioners of the dark arts, especially necromancers, are exposed to the inherent darkness and potential dangers of their craft. This can predispose them to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or even addiction-like behaviors related to their craft.

3. Emotional struggles: The responsibility and consequences of interacting with both the living and the dead will likely weigh heavily on necromancers. They may struggle with loneliness, as they develop complex relationships with the dead while potentially experiencing ostracism from the living due to their chosen path.
