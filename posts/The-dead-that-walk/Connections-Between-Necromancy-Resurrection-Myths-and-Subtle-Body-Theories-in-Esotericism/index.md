To answer this knowledge challenge, I will begin by providing a brief overview of the concepts mentioned: necromancy, resurrection myths, and subtle body theories in esotericism. I will then explore how each of these concepts informs and shapes our understanding of the dead that walk, touching upon similarities and differences across various cultural contexts. Finally, I will summarize the key ideas and conclusions derived from the examination of these interrelated topics.

Necromancy is the practice of communicating with the dead and invoking their spirits to gain insights into the future or the unseen world, often with the intent of utilizing this knowledge for magical purposes or personal gain. The term comes from the Greek words 'nekros' (dead) and 'manteia' (divination), and throughout history, necromancy has been associated with various forms of ritualistic magic and practices of raising the dead.

Resurrection myths, on the other hand, are present across many cultures, often as central elements in religious and mythological narratives. They involve the concept of return to life or rebirth after death, either in a physical, spiritual, or metaphorical sense. Some examples of resurrection myths include the Egyptian myth of Osiris, the Greek myth of Dionysus, and the Christian story of Jesus Christ's resurrection.

Subtle body theories are found within various esoteric belief systems and propose the existence of an immaterial aspect of the body, often described as an energy field or "aura" surrounding or interpenetrating the physical body. This subtle aspect is believed to operate on a higher plane of existence and can influence the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of an individual.

Having established an understanding of these concepts, let us explore how they intertwine to shape our perception of the dead that walk. Necromancy and resurrection myths both contribute to the notion that death is not an absolute end but rather a transition into a different state of being, which can be reversed or transcended in various ways. The existence of such practices implies an enduring connection between the living and the dead, fostering a belief in the possibility of interaction and influence between the two realms.

The concept of subtle bodies further complements this idea by positing the existence of an intangible aspect of life that persists beyond physical death. Subtle body theories offer an explanation for how the dead could be raised or how deceased spirits might interact with our material world on another level of existence, separate from the corporeal body.

It's crucial to recognize that the connections between necromancy, resurrection myths, and subtle body theories vary across different cultural contexts. In some cultural or religious traditions, necromancy or interaction with the dead is considered taboo or even evil, while others make use of subtler bodies and spirit world interactions in a more positive context (e.g., ancestor veneration).

Ultimately, the way all these concepts interconnect across diverse belief systems and traditions works to shape our understanding of the dead that walk in several key ways:

1. The interplay of necromancy, resurrection myths, and subtle body theories reinforces the belief that life and death are part of a continuous cycle or transformation process, rendering the boundary between the living and the dead porous and permeable.

2. Collectively, these ideas suggest that death is not a final destination but rather a malleable state that can be altered, negotiated, or transcended through various practices, rituals, and esoteric knowledge.

3. The existence of such interrelated concepts across various cultural contexts supports a shared human curiosity and fascination with the mysteries of life, death, and the supernatural.

4. Lastly, the specific ways in which necromancy, resurrection myths, and subtle body theories correlate to our understanding of the dead that walk can differ across cultural, religious, and historical contexts, allowing for rich and varied interpretations of this enigmatic and captivating phenomenon.

In conclusion, the relationships between necromancy, resurrection myths, and subtle body theories are integral to shaping our understanding of the dead that walk. They provide a framework for conceptualizing death as a mutable, negotiable state, hint at the existence of an ineffable, perhaps spiritual realm, and reveal humanity's enduring attempts to demystify and engage with the enigma of life beyond death.
