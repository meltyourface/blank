The knowledge challenge posed is to analyze the significance of establishing and maintaining a balance between spiritual discernment and corporeal susceptibility while building relationships with dead spirits, taking into account relevant metaphysical concepts, psychological correlations, and ethical implications. 

Metaphysical Concepts:

The metaphysical concepts relevant to this discussion include the notions of the spirit world, spiritual energies, and the vibrational frequencies of entities. The spirit world, an alternate plane of existence believed to be inhabited by spirits and other non-corporeal beings, can be accessed by individuals possessing heightened spiritual discernment and sensitivity. Spiritual energies refer to the life force that animates all living beings, connecting us to this unseen realm. Vibrational frequencies pertain to the different levels at which spiritual energy vibrates, which is believed to influence interaction between spirits and living beings.

Spiritual Discernment:

The term 'spiritual discernment' refers to the ability to perceive and distinguish between different spiritual energies, allowing individuals to approach building relationships with dead spirits mindfully and selectively. Spiritual discernment is critical when engaging with spirits, as it enables practitioners to differentiate between benevolent and malevolent entities, ensuring they only interact with those spirits that positively resonate with their intentions. 

Corporeal Susceptibility:

Corporeal susceptibility, on the other hand, is the vulnerability of the physical body to influences from spiritual energies or entities. When connecting with the spirit world, the practitioner's body may serve as a vessel, making them susceptible to otherworldly forces that could potentially be harmful or draining, affecting their physical and mental well-being. Maintaining a balance with spiritual discernment ensures the practitioner can adequately protect themselves from detrimental spiritual influences.

Psychological Correlations:

When engaging with the spirit world, several psychological factors come into play, including perception, empathy, and altered states of consciousness. These factors influence the individual’s receptivity to spiritual energies and their ability to communicate with spirits. The practitioner’s mental and emotional state can serve as a gateway for these energies to manifest, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining a mindful and balanced approach when interacting with dead spirits.

Ethical Implications:

The ethical implications of building relationships with dead spirits involve respect for the spirits' autonomy, exercising caution to not exploit them for personal gains, and adhering to the principle of beneficence—ensuring that interactions with spirits aim to foster mutual understanding and growth. Acknowledging the sanctity of life and death, staying grounded in values, and resolutely avoiding harmful practices and rituals are necessary precautions in the ethical pursuit of spiritual connections with the deceased.

In View of the Above Factors,

The significance of establishing and maintaining balance between spiritual discernment and corporeal susceptibility while building relationships with dead spirits is multifaceted. Balancing the two aspects ensures practitioners approach spiritual interactions mindfully, selectively, and ethically. This balance also protects their physical, emotional, and mental well-being, safeguarding them from the potential harms of engaging with spirits. 

In summary, the key themes of this knowledge challenge include understanding the prevalent metaphysical concepts, recognizing the importance of spiritual discernment and corporeal susceptibility in interactions with spirits, appreciating the psychological correlations involved, and adhering to ethical principles while building relationships with dead spirits. Maintaining this equilibrium ensures a respectful, ethical, and spiritually enriching interaction between the living and the deceased, while appropriately safeguarding the practitioner's overall well-being.
