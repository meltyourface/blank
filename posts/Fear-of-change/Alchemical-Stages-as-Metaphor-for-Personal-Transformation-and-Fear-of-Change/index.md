To symbolically evoke the process of transformation through the alchemical stages of Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo, while illustrating the interplay between fear of change, personal growth, and the inherent spiritual becoming involved in transcending that fear, we must first understand the essence of each alchemical stage and how they tie into the human experience. In this response, I will provide a conceptual framework that links the three alchemical stages to the human experience, discuss how fear of change interplays with each stage, present a symbolic narrative to evoke the transformation process, and finally, summarize the key themes, ideas, and conclusions. 

1. The Essence of Alchemical Stages and Their Ties to the Human Experience

i. ****Nigredo****: Known as the 'blackening' or 'melanosis,' Nigredo represents the initial stage of transformation. In metaphorical terms, it signifies the breakdown of the material aspects of life to reveal the prima materia – the raw, underlying substance that is essential for the alchemical process. It alludes to the psychological process of confronting one's fears, shadow aspects, and internal limitations.

ii. ****Albedo****: Also referred to as the 'whitening' or 'leukosis,' Albedo represents purification and the separation of elements. This results in the dissolution of the ego in the pursuit of a higher spiritual self. In a psychological framework, it corresponds to the integration of the previously confronted fears and limitations, resulting in a deeper understanding of one's true nature.

iii. ****Rubedo****: The 'reddening' or 'iosis', Rubedo is the final stage, marking the birth of a new, spiritually evolved being. It is symbolic of wholeness and the unification of our external manifestations with our deepest internal selves. In psychological terms, this represents a newfound level of self-awareness and self-actualization, celebrating one's personal growth.

2. Fear of Change and the Alchemical Stages

Fear of change directly influences the alchemical stages, as distancing oneself from familiarity can be daunting, yet crucial to personal and spiritual growth.

i. ****Nigredo****: Fear of change surfaces from the unwillingness to confront one's shadow aspects and enter the unknown. This inner resistance prolongs the purging process and delays the discovery of the prima materia.

ii. ****Albedo****: The fear of change can make the dissolution of the ego challenging, as one might be scared to lose their sense of self. Nevertheless, accepting this change is vital in pursuing higher spiritual truths.

iii. ****Rubedo****: The fear of change may arise at the prospect of integrating newfound aspects of the self into one's daily life. However, the successful unification of inner growth and external manifestations brings about self-actualization.

3. Symbolic Narrative

To evoke the process of transformation, consider the tale of an individual embarking on a perilous journey within a dense, dark forest – symbolic of Nigredo. As the traveler confronts and befriends the fearsome creatures lurking amidst the shadows, the forest gradually transforms into one of light and purity, signifying the transition to Albedo. Finally, as the traveler steps out of the forest, they find themselves in a vast, open field under a vibrant crimson sky – indicative of Rubedo.

4. Summary

In conclusion, the alchemical stages of Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo can be applied to human experience, reflecting the processes of confronting one's fears (Nigredo), purifying the self through the integration of these fears (Albedo), and ultimately, achieving self-actualization (Rubedo). Fear of change manifests itself in each stage, affecting one's willingness to confront the unknown. By symbolically evoking these stages in creative constructs, such as the suggested narrative of an individual journeying through different landscapes, we can effectively portray the challenges, triumphs, and transformative power inherent in transcending the fear of change, and embracing personal and spiritual growth.
