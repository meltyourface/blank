- To further conceal the true meaning behind rituals from non-initiates

The primary purpose of incorporating occult symbolism into Freemasonry practices is to further conceal the true meaning behind rituals from non-initiates. Freemasonry is often regarded as a secretive organization where its members are bound by a code of silence and strict adherence to its customs and practices. A Revelation of FreemasonryWitchcraft clarifies the various esoteric and occult aspects of Freemasonry and provides an in-depth analysis of the symbolism, rituals, and philosophies that underpin the organization.

The incorporation of occult symbolism serves multiple purposes within Freemasonry. First and foremost, it allows the organization to obscure the true meaning of its rituals and teachings, ensuring that only those who have been initiated and have an understanding of the symbolism can truly appreciate the significance of the rites they participate in. This method of concealing information is not unique to Freemasonry and can be found in various esoteric and occult traditions, such as Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Alchemy.

This practice of incorporating symbolism also serves to reinforce the sense of unity and shared knowledge among lodge members. It adds a layer of mystique to the organization, which can attract individuals interested in exploring esoteric and mystical ideas, further ensuring that the secrets of the organization remain hidden from the uninitiated.

As well as providing a veil of secrecy, occult symbolism is also used to represent universal concepts, ideas, and spiritual principles, transcending cultural and religious barriers. This allows Freemasonry to draw from a rich tapestry of symbolism in its rituals and teachings, ensuring that these principles remain relevant to members from different backgrounds and belief systems.

It should be noted that while some individuals may join Freemasonry with ulterior motives, such as utilizing connections to advance personal agendas or gain social status, these are not considered the primary objectives of the organization. Freemasonry is fundamentally a philosophical and spiritual institution that teaches moral values, self-improvement, and enlightenment through its rituals and symbolism.

In conclusion, the primary purpose of incorporating occult symbolism into Freemasonry practices is to further conceal the true meaning behind rituals from non-initiates. This serves the dual purpose of preserving the secrets of the organization and reinforcing the shared beliefs and values among members, allowing Freemasonry to serve as a platform for the exploration and development of philosophical and spiritual ideas.
