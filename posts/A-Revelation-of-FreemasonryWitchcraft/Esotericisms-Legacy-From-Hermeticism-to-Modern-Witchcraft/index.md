To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the various components at play: the development and evolution of Hermeticism, the symbology found in Freemasonry, the origins and philosophies of modern witchcraft and Wicca, and the role of historical figures such as Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley in shaping these beliefs and practices. Lastly, we will integrate the cultural context of the witch trials of Early Modern Europe. 

**Hermeticism**

Hermeticism is a set of philosophical and spiritual beliefs that date back to late antiquity, originating from the Greco-Egyptian mystery tradition and the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. This spiritual approach synthesizes elements of Greek, Egyptian and Middle Eastern mysticism. Its core tenets include the principle of "As above, so below," the concept of mentalism (that we create our reality with our minds), and the idea that there is a divine connection between all things. The evolution of Hermeticism through the ages has influenced many other esoteric traditions, such as the Kabbalah, alchemy and Western ceremonial magic.

**Symbology in Freemasonry**

Freemasonry is a fraternal organization dating back to the late 16th or early 17th century. Its teachings revolve around moral and ethical lessons drawn from sacred texts such as the Bible, as well as the symbolism of ancient stonemasons. Freemasonry incorporates symbols derived from various esoteric sources, including alchemy, Hermeticism, and the Kabbalah. These symbols, with many layers of meaning, help the practitioner to gain spiritual insight.

**Origins and Philosophies of Modern Witchcraft and Wicca**

Modern witchcraft, which encompasses various traditions, emerged primarily in the 20th century. Many people consider Wicca to be the most well-known and widely practiced form of modern witchcraft. Founded by the aforementioned Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, Wicca combines elements of traditional Western occultism, ceremonial magic, folklore, and other sources in a religious belief system centered around the worship of a goddess and a god, and the practice of witchcraft as part of a spiritual path.

**Role of Historical Figures in the Development of Witchcraft and Wicca**

Gerald Gardner, regarded as the "father of Wicca," played a pivotal role in the development and popularization of modern witchcraft. He integrated many sources into his new religious movement, including elements borrowed from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which also influenced Aleister Crowley. Crowley, although more focused on ceremonial magic and thelemic teachings, shared some elements with Gardner's Wicca, such as invoking deities and using ceremonial tools and symbols. Thus, both Gardner and Crowley played significant roles in the development and dissemination of modern witchcraft and Wicca.

**Interconnections Among Hermeticism, Freemasonry, and Witchcraft**

The development of Hermeticism and the symbology inherent in Freemasonry have had a profound influence on the origins and philosophies of modern witchcraft and Wicca. Both Hermeticism and Freemasonry emphasize the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of all things and the quest for divine wisdom and personal enlightenment. These elements are carried over into modern witchcraft and Wicca through the exploration of deities, rituals, traditions, and practices that emphasize the same principles. In this way, the wisdom and teachings of these ancient traditions echo throughout the foundations of modern witchcraft and Wicca.

**The Witch Trials of Early Modern Europe**

The infamous witch trials of Early Modern Europe fueled myths and misconceptions about the nature of witchcraft and magical practices. Although some persecuted individuals might have been practitioners of folk magic or herbalism, the majority of those accused during the witch trials were not involved in any form of witchcraft. This period of intense persecution led to a general demonization of witchcraft, which eventually had to be reconciled when the modern witchcraft resurgence emerged. By incorporating the resilience of the accused witches from the trials, modern witchcraft honors their memory and counters the negative stereotypes that persisted from this dark chapter in history.

**In Conclusion**

The development and evolution of Hermeticism, alongside the symbology found in Freemasonry, have significantly influenced the origins and philosophies of modern witchcraft, particularly Wicca, through the shared emphasis on spiritual enlightenment, divine interconnectedness, and a multi-faceted understanding of the world. Key historical figures such as Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley helped shape these contemporary practices by drawing upon the rich and varied esoteric sources of the past. Furthermore, the myths surrounding the witch trials of Early Modern Europe have shaped the modern conception of witchcraft, as they serve to remind the community of the persecution and resilience of those who have come before them. In this way, the connections between these esoteric traditions demonstrate the rich and complex tapestry from which modern witchcraft and Wicca were woven.
