  Conjuring a comprehensive chronological framework of prominent occult practitioners and scholars within the realm of Psycho-aetheric toxins, we venture through time, starting from the early beginnings of human fascination with the esoteric until the present day. Throughout this journey, we will outline pivotal discoveries, contributions, and paradigm leaps.
  
  1. **Circa 1200 BCE - Egyptian priest-scientist Nescheta**: Nescheta's endeavors often revolved around the power of Psycho-aetheric toxins to induce hallucinogenic states for spiritual purposes. His seminal work, "The Labyrinth of Nescheta," documents extensive experimentation and formulation of several potent mixtures.
  
  2. **400 BCE - Ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles**: In his lost work, "Psycho-aetheric Manipulations," Empedocles describes the fundamental principles of the four elements (air, earth, fire, and water) interacting with human psycho-aetheric energies, laying a framework for future studies within the field.
  
  3. **146 AD - Roman scholar Lucius Apuleius**: Best known for "The Golden Ass," Apuleius was also immersed in the study of Psycho-aetheric toxins. He wrote a treatise, "Infularum Venenum," that detailed the effects of such toxins on animal and human behavior.
  
  4. **13th century - Persian mystic and alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan**: Pivotal in bridging the gap between Eastern and Western mysticism, Jabir's work on the nature of the human soul and the interaction of Psycho-aetheric toxins within alchemical pursuits was recorded in his treatise, "The Book of Poisonous Elixirs."
  
  5. **16th century - Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa**: Author of "Three Books of Occult Philosophy," Agrippa's explorations into a unified theory of esoteric knowledge significantly impacted the academic study of the occult. His work made connections between Psycho-aetheric toxins and the human soul, especially through astral projection and dream manipulation.
  
  6. **Late 16th century - John Dee and Edward Kelley**: Renowned for their enigmatic scrying sessions, this English duo's work on Enochian magic led to the discovery of Psycho-aetheric toxin-infused sigils and their potential to summon otherworldly entities.
  
  7. **Late 19th century - Helena Petrovna Blavatsky**: Co-founder of the Theosophical Society, Blavatsky's "The Secret Doctrine" elaborates on the application of Psycho-aetheric toxins within karmic and spiritual development.
  
  8. **Early 20th century - Aleister Crowley**: One of the most notorious occult figures, Crowley's "Liber Al vel Legis" and the development of Thelema intertwined his hedonistic lifestyle with the harnessing of Psycho-aetheric toxins for rituals and ceremonies.
  
  9. **Mid-20th century - Andrija Puharich**: A parapsychologist and medical doctor, Puharich's pivotal work "The Sacred Mushroom" explored the psychoactive properties of certain fungi, examining their potential as Psycho-aetheric toxins capable of inducing otherworldly experiences.
  
  10. Late 20th century - Dr. John C. **Lilly**: Scientist and consciousness explorer, Lilly's experiments with sensory deprivation tanks and psychedelics shed light on the potential for altering the human perception of reality through exposure to Psycho-aetheric toxins.
  
  Throughout history, a myriad of occult practitioners and scholars have delved deeply into the mysteries of Psycho-aetheric toxins. Their work has paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the subtle energies, both within and beyond the human psyche. With this framework, we observe the ever-flowing exchange of ideas among these titans, leading to fascinating advancements in esoteric knowledge.
