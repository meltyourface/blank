## The Sigillum Purificatio of Baphomet

Purpose: The Sigillum Purificatio is a purification ritual within the Mass of Baphomet, intended to cleanse and prepare the practitioner for engaging with Goetic entities. This ritual aids in establishing a connection with the divine and seeks the protection and guidance of Baphomet.

Materials:

1. Sacred Vestments: Black robes adorned with the Sigil of Baphomet, symbolizing the practitioner's connection to the deity.
2. Ritual Tools: Athame, chalice, pentacle, and wand to represent the four elements and their respective guardians.
3. Sacred Sigils: Sigil of Baphomet, Pentagram of Solomon, and a protective sigil specific to the Goetic entity in question.
4. Offerings: Red wine, copal incense, and a bowl filled with soil as the representation of the Earth.
5. Ceremonial Music/Chants: A ritual drumming track or chants specific to Baphomet and the Mass. The "Io Pan, Io Baphomet" is a common chant in this tradition.

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Preparation: Set up a sacred space or altar, including the ritual tools, sigils, offerings, and any other elements specific to the Mass of Baphomet tradition. Don the sacred vestments and purify the area with a brief smudging ritual.

2. Circle Casting: Using the athame, draw an invoking pentagram three times in the air while focusing on Baphomet's presence. As each pentagram is drawn, recite: "In the name of Baphomet, I cast this sacred circle."

3. Elemental Invocations: Use the wand to call upon each of the four elemental guardians in turn, starting with the east (air), then moving to the south (fire), west (water), and north (earth). As each guardian is invoked, envision them taking their place around the circle to provide protection.

4. Invocation of Baphomet: Light the copal incense and, holding the Sigil of Baphomet, recite: "Io Pan, Io Baphomet, I invoke your presence. Purify me and guide me in my workings with the Goetic spirits. May your essence empower and protect me."

5. Offerings: Pour the red wine into the chalice and place it on the pentacle. Hold the bowl of soil above the chalice, sprinkling a small amount into the wine to represent the joining of earth and blood. Recite: "I offer this sacred union to you, Baphomet, may it serve as a symbol of my devotion."

6. Tracing the Sigils: Imprint the Pentagram of Solomon and the protective Goetic sigil upon your forehead using anointing oil. This act symbolizes the seeker's connection to the divine and a layer of protection from any harmful influences.

7. Purification Chant: Repeat the "Io Pan, Io Baphomet" chant nine times while maintaining a trance-like state and focusing on any negativity being cleansed from your being. With each repetition, feel the connection to Baphomet strengthen.

8. Sealing the Ritual: Once the purification process feels complete, raise your arms and recite: "By the power of Baphomet, I am purified and ready for the path ahead. I accept the guidance and protection of the elemental guardians and the divine presence of Baphomet." Drink a portion of the wine-soil mixture as a way to internalize the divine connection.

9. Circle Closing: Thank the elemental guardians and Baphomet for their assistance and release them from their duties within the circle. Using the athame, trace a banishing pentagram three times in the air and recite: "The circle is open, but unbroken."

10. Aftercare: Take time to ground and center yourself, reflecting on the experience and solidifying the divine connection in your mind and heart.

The Sigillum Purificatio of Baphomet is a crucial ritual for those within the Mass of Baphomet tradition who work with Goetic magick. This purification process prepares the practitioner for the intense challenges they may face when interacting with Goetic entities and helps to fortify their connection with Baphomet as a protective and guiding force.
