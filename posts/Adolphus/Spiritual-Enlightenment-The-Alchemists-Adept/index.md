The correct answer is: An esoteric term for an adept who has achieved spiritual enlightenment through inner alchemy.

Adolphus, within the esoteric domain, is an occult term referring to a spiritually enlightened adept who has achieved the highest form of spiritual enlightenment through the practice of internal alchemy.

The term 'Adolphus' is derived from the Latin 'Adolph', which means 'noble wolf'. It implies the idea of an individual who has transcended the limitations of their physical, mental, and spiritual aspects, becoming a noble and wise soul capable of guiding others towards their own spiritual awakening.

In the context of occult studies, achieving Adolphus status involves going through a series of spiritual and alchemical transformations, following a path of self-discovery and inner growth. This includes meditative practices, visualization exercises, energy work, and study of various esoteric philosophies and teachings.

The concept of Adolphus also ties into ancient traditions of hermeticism and the practice of alchemy. Alchemy, both in its physical and spiritual aspects, is closely related to the study of the occult, and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment is its ultimate goal.

Physical alchemy, sourced in the principles of hermeticism, concerns the transformation of base metals into gold. Simultaneously, spiritual alchemy is focused on the transformation of the individual's soul, purifying it and refining it into a state of spiritual enlightenment. Adolphus embodies this transformation, representing someone who has mastered the art of inner alchemy.

In summary, Adolphus is an esoteric term that denotes an adept who has attained spiritual enlightenment through inner alchemy, unlocking profound wisdom, and transcending the limitations of their physical existence. By understanding the metaphors and analogies present within the practice of alchemy and the related studies of hermeticism and the occult, we can appreciate the significance and depth of this concept.
