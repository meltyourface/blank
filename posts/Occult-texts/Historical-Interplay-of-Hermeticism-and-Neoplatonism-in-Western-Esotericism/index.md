Hermeticism and Neoplatonism are two philosophical systems that have greatly impacted the development of Western esotericism and occult traditions. Both systems have their roots in Late Antiquity, with Hermeticism stemming from the Hellenistic period (1st to 3rd centuries CE) and Neoplatonism emerging from the late Roman Empire (3rd to 6th centuries CE). Despite some differences between them, Hermeticism and Neoplatonism share several key concepts and themes, and their historical and theoretical interaction has generated a rich interweaving of ideas.

Historical Figures and Key Writings:

Hermeticism is primarily associated with the figure of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary sage who was hailed as the source of all wisdom. The primary texts of Hermeticism are the Corpus Hermeticum, a collection of Greek dialogues containing philosophical, theological, and magical teachings, and the Asclepius, a treatise on the spiritual regeneration of humanity.  Moreover, the Emerald Tablet, containing the famous dictum 'As above, so below,' is attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.

Neoplatonism, on the other hand, was founded by the philosopher Plotinus, who built upon the earlier ideas of Plato and his followers. His work, the Enneads, is a key text of Neoplatonism, as are the writings of later Neoplatonists like Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus.

Influences and Interactions:

During the Renaissance, the recovery and translation of numerous Hermetic and Neoplatonic texts led to the confluence of these traditions. Scholars like Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola synthesized the ideas of both systems, with Ficino translating the Corpus Hermeticum and part of Plotinus' Enneads into Latin. This rebirth of interest in ancient wisdom created a fertile ground for the development of esoteric and occult theories, linking Hermeticism and Neoplatonism in mysterious and profound ways.

Conceptual Parallels:

1. **The One and Monad**: Both systems revolve around a supreme, transcendent, and ineffable principle. In Neoplatonism, this is known as The One, the ultimate source of all. In Hermeticism, it is often referred to as the Monad, the first principle that contains everything within it.

2. **Emanation and hierarchy**: Both traditions posit a hierarchical structure of reality, where various divine principles and beings emanate from the ultimate source, moving from a higher level of unity and purity to lower levels of multiplicity and materiality. In Neoplatonism, this process proceeds through the hypostases of Nous (Divine Mind) and Psyche (World Soul), while Hermetic cosmology features various hierarchical orders and levels of celestial entities and deities.

3. **Ascent and purification**: Both systems emphasize that the human soul has the potential to rise through the various levels of reality, ultimately attaining union or absorption with the supreme principle. This path of ascent often involves processes of purification, knowledge acquisition, and the cultivation of virtues.

4. **Magic and theurgy**: Both Hermeticism and Neoplatonism include practices of theurgy and magic, emphasizing the use of rituals, symbols, and invocations to encourage the soul's ascent and ultimately reestablish its divine status. Iamblichus, one of the leading Neoplatonists, notably integrated theurgy into Neoplatonism.

In conclusion, the complex interactions between Hermeticism and Neoplatonism throughout history have greatly shaped Western esoteric and occult traditions. Their intricate connections have forged a rich synthesis of ideas that continues to inspire and inform contemporary spiritual seekers, as well as those interested in the history of Western philosophical and religious thought.
