excerpt: Design a detailed blueprint for a moonlit sanctuary dedicated to Selene by meticulously selecting a range of nocturnal plants, mystical herbs, and lunar blooms that resonate with the moon goddess's energies and symbolism. Take into account various factors including the local climate, soil type, water requirements, and the amount of moonlight received. Additionally, consider the unique visual and olfactory aesthetics during various lunar phases and incorporate arrangements that reflect the distinct aspects of Selene. Conceive creative pathways, an altar space, and a contemplative seating area within the moon garden design, ensuring the overall ambiance exudes an aura of enchantment, serenity, and connection with the lunar deity.
