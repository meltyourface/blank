B. Characteristics and Qualities

Souls from the dead possess a unique set of characteristics that distinguish them from other spiritual entities. They retain their consciousness and memories from their earthly existence and are capable of imparting knowledge, wisdom, and guidance to those who seek it. Moreover, these souls exhibit varying degrees of energy, which often reflect their spiritual development, life experiences, and emotional state at the time of their departure from the physical plane.

One of the primary roles of Souls from the dead in the occult is the transmission of ancestral wisdom and knowledge. By connecting with these souls, practitioners can gain insights into the lives of their ancestors, access their knowledge and expertise, and use this information to enhance their own spiritual growth.

B. Spiritual Guidance

Souls from the dead have the unique capacity to observe the events unfolding in the living world from a higher plane of consciousness. This vantage point allows them to offer invaluable spiritual guidance to those who seek their counsel, aligning the practitioners with their true purpose and providing clarity in times of uncertainty.

The energy possessed by Souls from the dead can be harnessed to allow the occult practitioner to manifest their desires and intentions in the material world. Through the alchemy of focused intention, practitioners can tap into the power of these souls to bring their wishes to fruition.

Performing dedicated rituals and offering tokens of appreciation, such as candles, incense, or personal items, can help strengthen the bond between the practitioner and the Soul from the dead. These actions serve as a symbolic acknowledgement of the soul's presence and can facilitate the energy exchange process.

C. Divination

The use of tools such as tarot cards, runes, or pendulums can help decipher the messages and insights conveyed by Souls from the dead. With practice, these instruments can become a valuable conduit for communication and guidance with the spiritual realm.

Before and after engaging with Souls from the dead, the practitioner should cleanse their energy using techniques such as smudging, visualization of protective barriers, and the invocation of protective spiritual forces.

B. Discernment and Boundaries

The practitioner must exercise discernment to ensure that they are connected with benevolent souls and should establish firm boundaries to prevent unsolicited interference from other spiritual entities.

Maintaining emotional balance and practicing self-care is crucial, as the energies and emotions of connected souls can impact the practitioner's mental and emotional well-being. Sufficient rest, a healthy lifestyle, and regular grounding practices can help mitigate these effects.
