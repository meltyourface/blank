The term "telepathy" comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: "tele" (τῆλε), meaning "far off, distant," and "patheia" (πάθεια), meaning "feeling or perception." It was first coined by Frederic W. H. Myers, a classic scholar, telepathy researcher and founding member of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in the 1882.

Within early 20th century literature, the term "telepathy" gained prominence alongside the growing interest in spiritualism, parapsychology, and the exploration of the human mind. Several influential works, authors, and cultural factors contributed to this etymological evolution.

1. Authors and works:
A few prominent authors and works exploring telepathy during this period include:

- Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" (1892): In "The Resident Patient," a character purports to have acquired telepathy after studying mesmerism in Australia.
- Algernon Blackwood’s "John Silence" series (1908): The titular character, Dr. John Silence, utilizes telepathy as one of his psychic abilities.
- H. G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds" (1898): The Martian invaders are described as utilizing telepathy to communicate.
- Edgar Rice Burroughs' "A Princess of Mars" (1912): In this story, the Martians possess telepathic abilities, both within their own species and between species.
- H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos (1920s-1930s): In Lovecraft's stories, telepathy is frequently used by incomprehensible alien entities.

2. Influential organizations:
In addition to authors, the growth and development of organizations such as the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) led to further research and popular interest in telepathy as a worldwide phenomenon.

3. Cultural factors:
During the early 20th century, numerous cultural factors contributed to the fascination with telepathy. Advances in science, particularly in psychology and brain research, sparked curiosity about the potential power of the human mind. Moreover, spiritualism and the Theosophical movement—both aimed at connecting with otherworldly dimensions—fueled the desire to explore psychic phenomena, including telepathy. 

4. Societal advancements:
Advancements in communication technologies, such as the invention of the telephone and the development of radio technology, paralleled with the growing interest in telepathy. People began to envision the possibility of communicating without the barriers of distance and language, amplifying the allure of telepathy and research into psychic abilities.

5. Comparative examples:
During this period, other terminologies associated with psychic phenomena and spiritualism entered mainstream discourse. These terminologies include:

- "clairvoyance": the ability to gain information about an object, person, or event via extrasensory perception
- "psychokinesis": the power of the mind to influence matter without physical interaction
- "mediumship": communicating with the deceased or other immaterial beings
