To fully respond to the knowledge challenge regarding the symbolic transformation that an initiate undergoes when embracing the duality between inner darkness and the Witchflame Arte under the guidance of the Dark Prince, we must first delve into the core concepts of duality, the Witchflame Arte, and the cardinal directions' association with the elements. This deep analysis will allow us to comprehend how such metamorphosis fosters spiritual growth by aligning the individual with the elements of the cardinal directions.

Duality, in the context of esoteric and occult studies, refers to the existence of two opposing forces or concepts that are inherently interdependent and interconnected. In the case of inner darkness and the Witchflame Arte, it represents the balance between the unknown, latent potential represented by inner darkness, and the conscious manipulation of those forces expressed through Witchflame Arte.

The Witchflame Arte itself is a powerful, esoteric practice through which individuals can harness and channel their inner darkness and latent energies to influence reality and manifest their desires. Following the guidance of the Dark Prince, who is reputed to be a master of dark wisdom and a revealer of hidden knowledge, the initiate seeks a deep understanding of him/herself and the world around them.

The cardinal directions - North, South, East, and West - and their corresponding elements - Earth, Fire, Air, and Water - play a significant role in various metaphysical philosophies. Each direction and its respective element hold specific attributes, and aligning with them allows for a fuller comprehension of the universe and ourselves, thus stimulating spiritual growth.

Returning to the core challenge, when an initiate embraces the duality between inner darkness and the Witchflame Arte under the guidance of the Dark Prince, they undergo a symbolic transformation symbolized by the Witchflame, which is a manifestation of their inner power. This metamorphosis represents the initiate's willingness to tap into the darkest recesses of their soul to uncover hidden talents, strengths, and potential while honoring the transformative energies of the Witchflame.

By acknowledging and balancing these opposing forces within themselves, the initiate experiences deeper self-awareness and understanding while unifying the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of their being. This alignment leads the initiate to establish a more profound connection with the elements represented by the cardinal directions.

This metamorphosis fosters spiritual growth in several ways. Firstly, it enables the initiate to have a heightened sense of self-mastery by understanding and harmonizing the opposing energies within their being. Secondly, it allows them to expand their knowledge and comprehension of existence by forging a deep connection with the elements of the cardinal directions, hence encompassing the diverse aspects of the cosmos. Finally, the self-awareness gained through this process ultimately leads the initiate to become a more complete, balanced individual who is better attuned to their surroundings and the universe as a whole.

In conclusion, the symbolic transformation an initiate undergoes when embracing the duality between inner darkness and the Witchflame Arte under the guidance of the Dark Prince represents a sacred rite in the quest for self-knowledge, mastery, and harmony within the cosmos. By aligning with the elemental forces of the cardinal directions, the initiate achieves spiritual growth and a deeper understanding of the world around them, ultimately becoming a more balanced, complete being.
