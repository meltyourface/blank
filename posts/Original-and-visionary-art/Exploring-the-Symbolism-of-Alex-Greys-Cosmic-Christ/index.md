The chosen original and visionary artwork for analysis is Alex Grey's "Cosmic Christ." As an iconic and profound piece by a renowned visionary artist, "Cosmic Christ" embodies the esoteric concepts of self-discovery, interconnectedness, and spiritual growth.

Fundamental Principles and Symbolism:
1. **Sacred Geometry**: "Cosmic Christ" follows the template of the sacred geometric symbol, Vesica Piscis, representing the merger of opposites and the birth of creation. Two overlapping circles within the painting represent the union of spirit and matter, creating a central almond-shaped section representing harmony and balance. Sacred geometry is deeply rooted in esoteric traditions such as Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Gnosticism, symbolizing the hidden order behind the physical manifestations of the universe.

2. **Divine Human Potential**: The central figure in the artwork is a luminous, multidimensional representation of Christ. This symbolizes the ennoblement and spiritual enlightenment of humanity, thus highlighting the importance of self-discovery in esoteric traditions. Manifesting in both Western and Eastern mystical practices, the idea of divine potential within humans transcends religious boundaries and reinforces a universal quest for spiritual growth and self-realization.

3. **Energy Fields (Auras and Chakras)**: Surrounding the central figure are radiant energy fields resembling auras and chakras, illustrating the energetic cosmos and the interconnectedness of all existence. The painting's portrayal of consciousness energy is symbolic of the hidden reality that underlies the physical world. This notion is present in various esoteric practices such as Reiki, energy healing, and Kundalini yoga, emphasizing life-force energy (prana or chi) and the subtle body.

Connection to historical occult tradition, philosophy, or practice:

The artwork of "Cosmic Christ" resonates deeply with Gnostic Christianity – a mystical branch of early Christianity that emphasizes direct knowledge and personal experience of the divine. Gnostic teachings revolve around the idea of self-discovery, personal transformation, and the liberation of one's inner divine spark, ultimately leading to salvation and reintegration with the divine source (e.g., the Gnostic concept of Pleroma). 

Gnostic Christianity's core principles, like the acknowledgment of the divine feminine (Sophia) and the symbolic language of the psyche, are harmonious with the Hermetic principle “As above, so below” and the Tree of Life in Kabbalah. By connecting the "Cosmic Christ" with Gnostic Christianity and other related mystical practices, we can explore a wider understanding of esoteric thought and inner spiritual journeys.

In conclusion, Alex Grey's "Cosmic Christ" incorporates fundamental principles and symbolism that represent the esoteric concepts of self-discovery and interconnectedness, as seen through sacred geometry, divine human potential, and energy fields. The painting is an outstanding visual representation of Gnostic Christianity's mystical ideas and their connections with Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and various other esoteric traditions. Embodying these spiritual concepts in a striking piece of visionary art, "Cosmic Christ" serves as an inspiring and vivid reminder of the profound journey we undertake toward self-realization, interconnectedness, and spiritual growth.
