Grave goods have played an essential role in the Viking Age (late 8th century to mid-11th century) Scandinavian burial customs. These items provide priceless insights into the society at the time, shedding light on their societal status, religious beliefs, and cultural practices. The inclusion of weapons, jewelry, and everyday objects within graves adds to our understanding of these complex burial customs.

In Viking Age Scandinavia, the burial customs tended to vary by region; however, several core elements remained consistent. High-status individuals were often buried in large, mound-covered boat burials, whereas lower-status individuals were placed in smaller graves with fewer grave goods. Burial goods like weapons (swords, axes, and spears), jewelry (brooches and necklaces), and everyday items (tools, clothing, and pottery) were often placed alongside the deceased. Some examples of famous archaeological sites of Viking Age burials and grave goods are Oseberg, Gokstad, Birka, and Jelling.

The inclusion of weapons in Viking burials symbolizes the individual's role as a warrior in life and the afterlife. The Norse mythology told of Valhalla, where deceased warriors would fight and feast. By placing weapons in the graves of their fallen warriors, the community ensured that they would be well-equipped for the afterlife. For instance, the mound burial from Valsgarde in Sweden was found an elite warrior with weapons such as a sword, spear, shield, and a set of arrows.

Jewelry and ornamental items were used to signify the status, wealth, and social position of the deceased individual. Brooches, necklaces, and arm rings, made from precious metals like gold and silver, were common grave goods. The famous Oseberg ship burial in Norway contained vast amounts of jewelry, carved wooden items, tapestries, and even a beautifully decorated burial sled, all representing the elite status of the deceased women in the grave.

Everyday objects, such as clothing, pottery, tools, and even animals, fulfilled specific practical and symbolic purposes. These items bore witness to the deceased's life and their contributions to their community. For example, a blacksmith might be buried with his tools, whereas a farmer could be buried with agricultural implements. In the case of ship burials, the inclusion of tools and everyday life objects highlights the belief in a continuation of trade and sea travels after death.

The selection of grave goods also suggests the impacts of trade, cultural influences, and evolving spiritual ideologies. Imported items, such as glassware from the Rhineland or Byzantine coins, illustrate trading networks maintained by the Vikings. Additionally, shifts in cultural influences and spiritual practices, such as the shift from paganism to Christianity, can be traced through the changes in burial customs and grave goods. For instance, early Christian graves in Scandinavia lack grave goods, reflecting the new belief system that did not emphasize physical possessions.

In conclusion, Viking Age grave goods of Scandinavia provide a window into the complex societal, religious, and cultural structures of the time. By examining the various types of grave goods, archaeologists gain a more profound understanding of the role that these objects played in burial customs, social status representation, and religious beliefs. Furthermore, the analysis of grave goods reveals insight into the complexities behind their possible purposes, taking into account the impacts of trade, cultural shifts, and evolving spiritual ideologies of Viking Age societies.
