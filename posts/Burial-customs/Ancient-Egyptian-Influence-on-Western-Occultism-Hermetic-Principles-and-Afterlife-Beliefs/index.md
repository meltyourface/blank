To answer this knowledge challenge, let's first understand the key concepts involved: ancient Egyptian burial customs, their beliefs in the afterlife and spiritual practices, Hermetic principles, and Western occultism. Next, we'll analyze how the Egyptian customs and beliefs relate to Hermetic principles and how these connections have influenced contemporary esoteric practices in the Western world.

Ancient Egyptian Burial Customs and Beliefs in the Afterlife:

Ancient Egyptians placed a strong emphasis on the death and afterlife, believing that it was crucial to prepare the deceased for their final journey. Their burial customs were designed to ensure the successful passage of the deceased into the afterlife and enable their ka (spiritual double) to continue living. The elaborate practices included mummification, burial with grave goods, and inscriptions of spells and guiding principles from the Book of the Dead. The primary purpose of these customs was to guarantee the deceased's eternal life and protect their body and spirit from harm.

Hermetic Principles:

Hermeticism is a philosophical and religious tradition based on the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. The central text of Hermeticism, the Corpus Hermeticum, contains a series of philosophical and spiritual writings. The Hermetic principles, particularly those outlined in the Kybalion, include:

1. **The Principle of Mentalism**: All is mind; the Universe is mental.
2. **The Principle of Correspondence**: "As above, so below; as below, so above."
3. **The Principle of Vibration**: Everything moves; nothing rests.
4. **The Principle of Polarity**: Everything has its pair of opposites.
5. **The Principle of Rhythm**: Everything flows, in and out; everything has its season.
6. **The Principle of Cause and Effect**: Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause.
7. **The Principle of Gender**: Gender is in everything; everything has masculine and feminine principles.

Western Occultism:

Western occultism is a multifaceted tradition that encompasses various esoteric disciplines, such as astrology, alchemy, magic, tarot, and spiritualism. It seeks to understand the hidden workings of the universe and the forces behind everyday life. Western occultism has been influenced by a variety of sources, including ancient Egyptian beliefs, Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and the Kabbalah.

Relation between Egyptian Burial Customs and Hermetic Principles:

The connection between ancient Egyptian burial customs and Hermetic principles can be seen in several ways. Firstly, Hermeticism is rooted in the fusion of Egyptian and Greek wisdom, which formed part of the Hellenistic culture in Alexandria. This synthesis of knowledge included Egyptian spiritual and funerary practices.

Secondly, Hermeticism emphasizes the immaterial and eternal nature of the soul, which aligns with ancient Egyptian beliefs in the afterlife. The Hermetic principle of Mentalism suggests that existence is mental or spiritual, mirroring the Egyptian focus on the ka and its preservation.

Lastly, the principle of Correspondence, "As above, so below; as below, so above," resonates with Egyptian concepts such as the association between earthly life and the celestial realm. The stars and other celestial bodies played a crucial role in guiding the deceased through the afterlife, and burial chambers were adorned with representations of celestial events. Similarly, the relationship between life on Earth and the spirit world defined ancient Egyptian religious practices and their construction of tombs and pyramids.

Influence on Present-Day Esoteric Practices in Western Occultism:

The influence of ancient Egypt and Hermeticism on Western occultism can be seen in various aspects. First, modern esoteric practices continue to be guided by the Hermetic principles, offering a framework for understanding and interacting with the universe. Additionally, the ancient Egyptian emphasis on the afterlife and spiritual practices continues to inform contemporary beliefs in the soul's nature and its journey after death.

Furthermore, the use of symbolism, rituals, and ceremonies in Western occultism was partially shaped by Egyptian practices. For instance, the tarot, a popular divination tool, is believed to have origins in ancient Egyptian wisdom and Hermetic principles. Moreover, the symbol-filled funeral texts and decorated sarcophagi of ancient Egyptians mirror contemporary occultists' use of sigils and symbols to channel energy and power.

To summarize, ancient Egyptian burial customs and afterlife beliefs deeply connect with the Hermetic principles and have influenced esoteric practices in Western occultism. The principles of Correspondence and Mentalism reflect Egyptian spiritual beliefs and practices, while the fusion of Egyptian and Greek wisdom gave rise to Hermeticism itself. The influence of Egypt's rich spiritual heritage is still evident in modern Western occultism, from tarot cards to the use of symbols and rituals.
