To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, we must first understand the key differences between the Younger Futhark and Elder Futhark rune systems, both in terms of history and their symbolic representations. The Elder Futhark is older and consists of 24 runes, while the Younger Futhark was derived from the Elder Futhark and only has 16 runes. This reduction in the number of runes gives us an insight into how each system was utilized in their respective periods. 

Historical Usage:

The Elder Futhark runes date back to 150 – 800 CE and were primarily used by Germanic tribes across various geographical regions. They were employed for both communication and magico-religious purposes. They were inscribed on items like weapons and amulets to bless the object or provide protection to the wearer. 

The Younger Futhark runes appeared around 800 CE after the Viking Age began, and it is believed that the reduction in rune count was a response to the simplification of the Old Norse language at that time. This system was primarily used for inscriptions and messaging, and over time, it began to take on a spiritual significance similar to the Elder Futhark.

Symbolic Representations:

Elder Futhark's 24 runes allowed for a more comprehensive representation of the various aspects of existence – both physical and metaphysical. The runes held their individual meanings, and the combination of runes could yield more complex representations.

Younger Futhark, having only 16 runes, inherently limited the scope of symbolic representation. However, each rune gained multiple meanings, as a single rune might represent an array of concepts. This shift led to an increased emphasis on the practitioner's intuition and interpretation, which could lead to more profound spiritual connections when working with the Younger Futhark.

Magical Applications:

Working with the Elder Futhark runes might provide an initiate with a more structured and clear-cut approach to magical applications. The 24 runes, with their specific meanings, may be seen as more versatile and leave less room for ambiguity. Thus, combining runes for creating specific sigils or engaging in divination practices might yield more straightforward insights.

The Younger Futhark, on the other hand, demands a heightened sense of intuition from the practitioner due to the overlapping meanings of each rune. Utilizing this rune system necessitates a deep connection to one's inner wisdom, making the discoveries subjective.

Potential Shifts in Spiritual Insights, Personal Growth, and Practical Applicability:

Working with the Elder Futhark runes can enhance understanding of the broader universal energies represented by runes and how they coincide with the physical world. This connection may lead to greater insights into physical manifestations of subtle energies and result in personal growth by deepening self-awareness.

In contrast, working with the Younger Futhark often involves a more intimate connection between the practitioner and the rune system. Consequently, this initiates a deeper exploration of one's spiritual self and fosters personal growth by cultivating a stronger connection between the individual's intuition and the universe.

From a practical standpoint, working with Elder Futhark may provide clearer and more specific results in magical applications due to its comprehensive set of runes. On the other hand, Younger Futhark might encourage the practitioner to rely on personal intuition and make more customized choices in magical practices. 

In summary, the Elder Futhark runes offer a more detailed and structured system in terms of historical usage, symbolic representations, and magical applications. This could lead to enhanced universal understanding and growth while providing practical benefits in magical practices. Meanwhile, the Younger Futhark's reduction in rune count emphasizes the importance of intuition and personal insight. The exploration of the Younger Futhark leads to a deeper connection to one's spiritual self, offering a more intimate and subjective experience in magico-religious practices.
