Upon examining the authentic Viking Age metal amulet, it becomes immediately apparent that the runes inscribed on it belong to the Younger Futhark script, used predominantly between the 9th and 11th centuries across Scandinavia and other areas influenced by the Norse culture.

The inscription, once deciphered, reads: "ᚢᛚᚠᚱ ᛫ ᚱᛅᛋᛏᛁᚾ᛫ᚱᚢᚾᛅᛦ᛫ᛁᛋ᛫ᚢᛁᚱᛁᚲᚢ" (Ulfarr raistin runar is uiriku). Translated to English, this means: "Ulfarr raised the runes in memory of Viriku." 

Upon closer examination of the etched runes, the inscription refers to a man named Ulfarr, who created this amulet in honor of another individual, Viriku. The use of the term "raised the runes" implies Ulfarr's deep understanding and mastery of runes – essences of power in the Norse culture, often associated with magic and used in various rituals, divination, and daily life practices.

Notably, the inscription does not simply reflect a commemorative message; there might be more to it due to the intricate patterns and arrangement of the runes. In Viking culture, runes were often used in rituals or magical workings to invoke specific forces, beings, or outcomes. The reference to "in memory of Viriku" could indicate that Ulfarr crafted this amulet not only as a tribute but also as an amulet to ensure Viriku's safe passage to the afterlife or even a spiritual aid in Viriku's honor.

Another possible symbolic element could be the use of the name Ulfarr, which combines "ulfr" (wolf) and "arr" (warrior), signifying a ferocious and determined figure. The name choice might have been intentional for Ulfarr to indicate his connection to the spirit of the wolf, which was a vital symbol for the Vikings as a representation of strength, cunning, and loyalty – characteristics Ulfarr possibly sensed in the deceased Viriku.

This analysis suggests that the amulet, besides being a memorial piece, holds deeper meanings connected to Viking Age magical practices and rituals. The amulet may have had a protective or beneficial purpose, possibly crafted by Ulfarr to gain favor with the gods or spirits or as a means of bolstering community support for Viriku's family.

In conclusion, the runic inscription on the amulet sheds light on the Norse culture, legacies, and esoteric practices, while also providing an intimate glimpse into the lives and aspirations of Ulfarr and Viriku. The study of this artifact has offered valuable knowledge about the Younger Futhark runes as key instruments in the Viking Age both in mundane communication and in more profound, mystical applications.
