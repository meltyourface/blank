description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Ouroboros, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a ritualistic invocation to summon the intricate, cyclical essence of Ouroboros during a significant period of transformation, integrating symbolic elements such as a serpent entwining itself, alchemical symbols, and ancient incantations, to facilitate a deeper connection to its mystical energy and enhance the experience of metamorphosis.

## I. Preparation

1. Begin by preparing the sacred space. Ensure the chosen location is free from distractions and disruptions, as well as cleansed of all negative energies.

2. Inscribe a circle around the perimeter of the area with a mixture of salt and crushed snake scales. This potent blend will act as a protective barrier against interference during the ritual.

3. Mark the cardinal points - North, South, East, and West - within the circle using symbols of corresponding elemental energies:

   1. North (Earth) - Draw a circumpunct, representing the unification of matter and spirit
   2. East (Air) - Inscribe the alchemical symbol for air, symbolizing divine breath and inspiration
   3. South (Fire) - Lay down a crimson candle adorned with the alchemical symbol for fire and sulfur
   4. West (Water) - Place a chalice filled with pure spring water adorned with the symbol for water and mercury

4. At the center of the circle, draw the serpent biting its tail, the Ouroboros, in powdered gold. Surround the Ouroboros with a ring of obsidian stones to deepen the connection to its transformative powers.

### II. Ritual

1. Stand before the sacred circle, and don the ceremonial robe to proclaim the self as a vessel for the energies of Ouroboros. Adorn the brow with a serpent-shaped circlet.

2. Light the crimson candle in the South, invoking the alchemical element of Fire, igniting illuminating inspiration and transformation.

3. Welcome each of the cardinal points by reciting the following invocation:

   "I call upon you, Elemental Guardians of the North, the East, the South, and the West!
    In this sacred circle, I invite you to join our coiled dance
    May your eternal energies awaken the Ouroboros' entrancing trance."

4. Stand within the circle, at the center of the Ouroboros symbol, and assume an asana for meditation. Begin with deep, rhythmic breathing, allowing the mind and body to establish a state of trance-like awareness.

5. Chant the ancient incantation thrice:

   "Serpentem infinitum, ego te advoco,
    Cycle of eternity, through darkness and light,
    Spiral of wisdom, engulf me in your might."

6. Visualize a powerful, luminous serpent rising from the deep, entwining itself around your body in an ascending spiral. As it winds its way upward, feel the energy of transformation intensifying.

7. Once the serpent has reached the crown chakra, imagine its mouth meeting its tail, forming the Ouroboros around your head. Open yourself to the wisdom and understanding imparted by the infinite cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

8. Seal the energy within by affirming:

   "I am one with Ouroboros, bearer of renewal and transformation,
    May my spirit embody the essence of eternity,
    And my soul find solace in the never-ending cycle,
    As above, so below, as within, so without."

### III. Closing

1. Thank the Elemental Guardians of the cardinal points, bidding farewell, and releasing their energies and protection back to their respective realms.

2. Extinguish the crimson candle.

3. Gently sweep away the gold Ouroboros symbol, collecting the gold and the obsidian stones for future use.

4. Scatter the mixture of salt and snake scales in the four cardinal directions, returning the sacred space to its previous state.

5. Reflect on the transformative experience and shift in perspective, integrating the wisdom of the Ouroboros into your being.
