Incantation of Prosperous Fortuity

### I. Introduction

The Incantation of Prosperous Fortuity is a powerful, intricate, and esoteric spell designed to channel and manifest the mystical energies of prosperity and good fortune. This ritual invokes the assistance of prominent deities and spirits associated with wealth and luck, such as Lakshmi, Fortuna, and Hermes. The following sections outline the casting method, suitable timing, required ceremonial tools, sacred geometry, and energy visualization techniques necessary for achieving maximum effectiveness in manifesting positive outcomes.

### II. Casting Method

To begin, find an appropriate and secluded space where you can perform the ritual undisturbed. Cleanse the area with purifying smoke from a sage bundle or incense, and ground yourself by taking deep, relaxing breaths. Once the area is prepared and your mind is focused, follow these steps:

1. Draw a sacred circle: Utilize powdered salt or chalk to delineate the area of the ritual. Within the circle, inscribe the sacred geometric symbols detailed in section IV.

2. Light the candles: Arrange and light seven candles in a semicircle (colors specified in section V), starting in the center and working outward.

3. Invoke the deities and spirits: Stand at the center of the circle, facing east, and recite the invocation detailed in section VI.

### III. Suitable Timing

The most auspicious time to perform this ritual is during a waxing moon phase when the energies of growth and expansion are the strongest. Ideally, the ritual should be conducted on either a Thursday or a Friday, both ruled by Jupiter and Venus, planets associated with abundance and success. Additionally, it is best to perform the ritual during the planetary hours of the respective deities (Sunrise for Lakshmi, Sunset for Fortuna, and Meridian for Hermes).

### IV. Sacred Geometry

Within the sacred circle, inscribe the following symbols of prosperity and good fortune:

1. Sri Yantra: A representation of wealth and abundance, associated with the Goddess Lakshmi.

2. The Horn of Plenty: Known as the Cornucopia, a symbol of bountiful harvest and prosperity, connected to Fortuna.

3. Caduceus: The intertwined serpents, emblematic of wisdom, communication, and commerce, linked to Hermes.

### V. Ceremonial Tools and Offerings:

1. Seven candles: One gold (center), two green (left and right), two silver (outer left and right), and two purple (outermost left and right).
2. An offering plate containing fresh fruits, honey, coins, and a small representation of the deities.
3. A chalice filled with spring water.
4. Incense (preferably frankincense or myrrh).

### VI. Invocation and Energy Visualization Technique

Recite the following invocation while visualizing a golden light, representing energy of prosperity, connecting you and the divine presences:

"O luminous Lakshmi, abundant provider,
Goddess of wealth and fortune, grace us with your presence.

Fortuna, gracious dispenser of destiny,
We seek your favor and bountiful blessings.

Mercurial Hermes, swift-footed messenger,
Bestow upon us your wisdom and inimitable fortune.

Bring forth the prosperous energies, the streams of abundance,
Channel them through my intent, to manifest in our lives.

By the authority of these sacred symbols,
By the light of these holy flames, I call thee forth.

O Lakshmi, Fortuna, and Hermes, hear my plea.
Rain upon us the gifts of wealth, prosperity, and good fortune."

Conclude the ritual by expressing your gratitude to the deities and spirits, extinguishing the candles in reverse order, and making an offering from the plate as a token of appreciation. Carry the empowered feeling of prosperity and abundance with you, nurturing the energy to manifest in your life fully.
