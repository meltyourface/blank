## Rite of the Triune Morrigna

### I. Preparation for the Sacred Rite

1. Choose a location with strong energetic significance, preferably a forest, near a body of water, or a hilltop. Cleanse the area with a purifying agent, such as sage or cedar smoke.

2. Create three distinct altars to represent the three aspects of the Goddess Morrigna: Anu, Badb, and Macha. Arrange them in a triangle formation.

3. Dress in ceremonial robes or armor to symbolize your connection to the divine energies of war and sovereignty.

### II. Consecration of the Sacred Offerings and Symbols

1. Place a cauldron at the center of the triangle. Fill it with pure water and add sacred herbs, such as vervain, oak, rowan, and mistletoe, to symbolize the healing powers and protection of the Goddess.

2. Arrange weapons (swords, spears, and shields) at each altar. Anoint each weapon with the blended oils of cinnamon, myrrh, and oakmoss to consecrate them in the name of the Morrigna.

3. Create intricate depictions of the triple aspects of the Goddess, using natural materials such as feathers, stones, and leaves. Place Anu in the North, symbolizing her connection to the earth; Badb in the West, representing her power over the waters and shape-shifting; and Macha in the East, symbolizing her rule over life and death in battle.

### III. Invocation of the Morrigna's Three Aspects

1. Begin by standing before Anu's altar. Light a green candle and say:
"Anu, Mother of the Earth, I call upon your ancient wisdom and nurturing spirit. Guide me in this rite and teach me the mysteries of life. Blessed be."

2. Move to Badb's altar. Light a blue candle and say:
"Badb, Shape-shifter of the battlefields, I invoke your fierce wrath and transformative powers. Stand by me in this rite and grant me insight into the chaos of life. Blessed be."

3. Proceed to Macha's altar. Light a red candle and say:
"Macha, Sovereign Queen, I summon your swiftness and skill in the art of war. Join me in this rite and lead me to victory in all life's battles. Blessed be."

### IV. Chants, Dances, and Meditations

1. Return to the cauldron at the center of the triangle. Utilize your knowledge of the divine attributes of each aspect of the Goddess and lead a chant focusing on the unique qualities of Anu, Badb, and Macha. Intone their names with deep respect and devotion.

2. Engage in a ritual dance, moving in a pattern that represents the interconnectedness of the three aspects while contemplating their link to warfare, destiny, and sovereignty.

3. Sit in a meditative posture between the altars, focusing on each aspect of the Morrigna in turn, and welcome their energies to interweave within your being.

### V. Closing the Sacred Rite

1. Thank the Goddess Morrigna and her three aspects for their presence and guidance in the ritual. Extinguish the candles one by one, starting with Macha, followed by Badb, and ending with Anu.

2. Carefully pack up the sacred offerings and symbols, ensuring they are treated with respect.

3. Close the sacred space by acknowledging the energies that participated in the rite and the location that supported the ceremony. Ground yourself and reconnect with your surroundings.

Upon completion of the Rite of the Triune Morrigna, you will have invoked the manifold embodiments of the Battle Goddess Morrigna and established a profound connection to her divine aspects. Use this connection wisely, and remember always to honor the Goddess in your actions and thoughts. Blessed be.
