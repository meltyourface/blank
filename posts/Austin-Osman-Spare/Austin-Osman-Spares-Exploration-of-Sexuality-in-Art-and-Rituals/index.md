Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was an English artist and occultist who developed a unique approach to esotericism through his exploration of sexuality in his artwork, sigils, and rituals. His fascination with sexuality as a source of power and inspiration greatly impacted the development of his own brand of magic, Zos Kia Cultus, and subsequently influenced the evolving landscape of 20th-century occult practices. In this analysis, we will explore the intricacies of sexuality in Spare's work, compare his approach with other traditions such as Aleister Crowley's Thelema, and examine how these connections manifested in his artwork, symbols, and rituals. 

Spare's Artwork and Symbolism

Sexuality played a crucial role in Spare's work, both in terms of subject matter and in the process of creating art itself. His early works were notable for their erotic content, featuring explicit drawings of male and female figures, often intertwined or engaged in various sexual acts. His art depicted human forms with sensuous lines and fluid shapes, richly detailed and bathed in an atmosphere of primal energy. 

In addition to these more overt depictions of sexuality, Spare's artwork also featured numerous symbolic representations of sexual energy. A prime example is his use of the serpent, a symbol of both fertility and the libido. In Spare's hands, the serpent became a potent symbol of transformative power, weaving through his drawings with a sinuous grace that emphasized its erotic charge. 

Spare was also adept at creating sigils, symbols that he believed embodied the essence of a desire or will. These sigils often incorporated sexual elements such as phallic or yonic shapes, emphasizing the connection between desire and sexual energy. Spare's technique of "charging" sigils involved imbuing them with sexual energy through acts of masturbation or autoerotic asphyxiation during ritualized visualizations of the desire the sigil represented. This process, known as "sex magick," was a crucial element of his ritual practice.

Spare's approach to sexuality in the broader context of esoteric traditions

Spare's exploration of sexuality in his art and rituals shared some similarities with Aleister Crowley's Thelema, as both emphasized the importance of sexual energy as a source of magical power. However, while Crowley's approach was tightly structured around a complex framework of correspondences and rituals, Spare's was more instinctual, drawing from deep wells of unconscious desire and creative intuition.

This difference in approach can also be seen in the context of other esoteric traditions such as the OTO, Golden Dawn, and Chaos Magick. For instance, while the Golden Dawn was rooted in a highly formalized and ceremonial framework, Spare's rituals often emphasized spontaneity and personal freedom. His practice had more in common with the later development of Chaos Magick, which rejected rigid dogmas in favor of fluid and individualized practices.

Specific illustrations and technique comparisons

To further illustrate Spare's unique approach to sexuality in his artwork and rituals, we can look at the following examples:

1. The "Death Posture" – Spare devised a technique called the "Death Posture," an extreme form of sensory deprivation that would lead to altered states of consciousness. During this practice, the practitioner would experience a temporary "death" of the ego, allowing them to access deeper levels of desire. Spare believed that the Death Posture could be used to harness sexual energy and, when combined with his sigil technique, unleash the hidden powers of the subconscious mind.

2. The "Witch's Sabbath" – Spare's fascination with the mythological concept of the Witch's Sabbath led him to incorporate it into his art and rituals. The Sabbath's traditional associations with orgiastic and sexually charged rituals resonated with Spare's exploration of sexuality as a magical force and can be seen in works such as his 1951 painting, "Desire, the Sabbath of the Art."

3. **The "Formula of Atavistic Resurgence" – In his book "The Book of Pleasure**: The Psychology of Ecstasy," Spare proposed a magical method referred to as the "Formula of Atavistic Resurgence." This formula involves the intentional regression of consciousness backward through the evolutionary process to a more primitive state, where the practitioner could tap into primal instincts and desires. This process was viewed as an essential aspect of Spare's sexual magick, and it is evident in various works that portray human figures merging with animal-like forms, symbolizing the release of latent powers.

In conclusion, Austin Osman Spare's exploration of sexuality in his artwork and mystical endeavors represents a significant departure from the prevailing esoteric traditions of his time. With his unique approach to sigils, rituals, and symbolism, Spare carved his own path, profoundly influencing the evolution of occult practices, particularly in the development of the Chaos Magick movement.
