## Title: The Occult Legacy of Austin Osman Spare: Sigil Magick, Alphabet of Desire, and Automatic Drawing

Introduction

Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was a British artist and occultist who contributed significantly to the Western esoteric tradition. His work, characterized by innovative artistic styles and groundbreaking magickal techniques, remains influential to this day across various spiritual paths. This chapter aims to explore Spare's key theories, beliefs, and practicesâ€”particularly his development of sigil magick, the Alphabet of Desire, and the use of automatic drawing in grimoires and Magick teachings. Additionally, we will examine his relationships with other prominent occultists of his time and the impact of his work on the broader esoteric landscape.

### I. Sigil Magick

A cornerstone of Spare's occult practice was sigil magick, a method of manifesting one's desires through the creation and activation of symbolic representations called sigils. Spare's approach to sigil magick is rooted in a psychological understanding of the subconscious mind, believing that one's intentions can be impressed upon the subconscious through the use of symbols and images.

Spare's method for creating sigils begins with writing down one's desire or intention, then eliminating any repeating letters until a series of unique characters remain. These individual characters are then combined, rearranged, and stylized into a single, coherent symbol. The sigil is imbued with energy and meaning through a process of focused meditation and emotional arousal, often referred to as "charging" the sigil. Once charged, the sigil is activated by transferring it to the subconscious mind, typically through forgetting or destroying the physical representation of the symbol.

### II. Alphabet of Desire

The Alphabet of Desire is another of Spare's original contributions to occult practice. While sigil magick focuses on the creation of individual symbols to represent specific intentions, the Alphabet of Desire consists of a set of pre-established symbols designed to represent the various emotions and desires that drive human behavior. By invoking these symbols in magickal workings, Spare believed that practitioners could directly influence the underlying emotional states of themselves and others.

Spare's Alphabet of Desire is a highly personal and intuitive system, with each practitioner encouraged to develop their own unique set of symbols tailored to their individual understanding and experience of human emotions. The creation of an Alphabet of Desire often includes significant introspection and self-exploration, as practitioners work to distill the essence of their emotions and desires into distinct symbols.

### III. Automatic Drawing

Automatic drawing is a technique employed by Spare to channel the subconscious and facilitate communication with the spirit realm. Drawing upon his background as an accomplished artist, Spare used the act of drawing as a means to access the deeper areas of his mind and unlock hidden knowledge and insight. This process allowed him to bypass conscious thought and enter a trance-like state, wherein his hand would create images and symbols without deliberate intention or control.

Spare's grimoire writings and magickal teachings are saturated with examples of automatic drawings, which he viewed as a vital component of his occult practice. He often used automatic drawing in conjunction with sigil magick and the Alphabet of Desire, allowing the images and symbols produced during the trance state to influence and inform his magickal workings.

### IV. Relations with Other Occultists

Spare's innovative ideas and practices attracted the attention of many prominent occultists of his time, including Aleister Crowley, with whom he briefly collaborated. However, due to conflicting beliefs and personalities, their partnership was short-lived. Spare's insistence on maintaining his independence from established occult orders ultimately led to his isolation from mainstream esoteric organizations. Despite this, his work continued to be influential, with later generations of occultists incorporating Spare's ideas and techniques into their own systems and practices.

### V. Spare's Impact on the Western Esoteric Tradition

Austin Osman Spare's unique and often radical approach to Magick had a profound and lasting impact on the Western esoteric tradition. His emphasis on personal experience, self-exploration, and the power of the subconscious, as well as his innovative techniques such as sigil magick, the Alphabet of Desire, and automatic drawing, continue to inspire and shape contemporary occult practice. Spare's influence is evident in various modern spiritual paths, including Chaos Magick, which draws heavily upon his ideas about personal symbolism and the power of the subconscious mind.

Conclusion

Austin Osman Spare was a trailblazer in the world of occultism, whose contributions to the Western esoteric tradition continue to be felt today. His development of sigil magick, the Alphabet of Desire, and the use of automatic drawing set a precedent for deeply personal, intuitive, and psychological approaches to magickal practice. By exploring Spare's theories, beliefs, and practices, students of the esoteric can gain a rich understanding of his occult legacy, as well as valuable insights into the potential of their own Magickal abilities.
