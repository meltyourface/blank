The best answer to this question is: Experiencing mystical union with the divine through esoteric practices and gnosis.

Antinomian Gnosticism is an esoteric spiritual tradition that departs from conventional religious beliefs and practices, focusing instead on the pursuit of direct, personal spiritual experience and knowledge (gnosis) as the way to achieve enlightenment and transcendence. The word "antinomian" comes from the Greek "anti," meaning "against," and "nomos," meaning "law" or "norm." This term reflects the Gnostic belief in transcending traditional moral norms to achieve spiritual enlightenment through divine knowledge and direct experience.

Adherence to rigid religious dogmas and rituals is not a core tenet of Antinomian Gnosticism. Traditional moral systems, including religious dogmas and rituals, are often seen as limiting and illusory in this spiritual tradition. Instead, Antinomian Gnostics emphasize the importance of personal insight, revelation, and experiential knowledge as the path to enlightenment.

The belief in a demiurge responsible for the material world is a common theme in Gnostic cosmology. However, it is not the primary aspect of Antinomian Gnosticism that focuses on transcending moral norms and achieving spiritual enlightenment. While recognizing the demiurge as the ruler of the material world may play a role in Gnostic thought, it is the pursuit of gnosis and esoteric practices that distinguish Antinomian Gnosticism as a spiritual tradition.

Strict observance of the Ten Commandments as the path to salvation is a concept more aligned with traditional Judeo-Christian theology rather than Antinomian Gnosticism. Antinomian Gnostics reject strict adherence to external moral codes, such as the Ten Commandments, in favor of internal, personal spiritual transformation through gnosis and esoteric practices.

Therefore, the belief in transcending traditional moral norms and achieving spiritual enlightenment through divine knowledge and direct experience in Antinomian Gnosticism is best represented by the concept of experiencing mystical union with the divine through esoteric practices and gnosis. This unique spiritual path seeks to liberate the individual from the constraints of conventional morality, allowing them to forge their own path toward true spiritual enlightenment and transcendence.
