The 18 Flames ritual begins with a meticulous cleansing of the designated sacred space. To achieve this, a solution of pure water, sea salt, and essence of rosemary is used to physically cleanse the area.

Once the area is cleaned, a protective circle is drawn on the floor. This circle is inscribed with the sigils of the Black Dragon Order, Ophite Gnostic teachings, and the 18 Flames. Starting at the eastern point of the circle, symbols representing air and the winged serpent, and moving in a clockwise direction, the elements of fire, water, and earth are drawn, each accompanied by their respective serpentine symbol.

Next, the practitioner lights candles of specific colors representing the 18 Flames: nine black and nine red, circling the center of the circle where the altar is set. The ritual tools, including the celebrant's chalice and athame, are placed on the altar.

The ritual begins as the practitioner dons a ceremonial robe and enters the circle. **They raise their hands toward the heavens, and invoke the energies of the 18 Flames with the following incantation**:

"I, (name), Child of the Black Dragon, Illuminist of the Ophite Gnosis, summon the forces of the 18 Flames to descend upon this sacred space. As above, so below, let the Serpent's Power flow."

Closing their eyes, the practitioner visualizes the serpent descending from the celestial realm and coiling around their body, with each of the 18 Flames illuminating the ceremonial space.

In this state of heightened focus, the practitioner recites the sacred Ophite Gnostic chants, creating a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms:

"Aglaophotis! Onicula! Ishpicoth! Zazas Zazas Nasatanada Zazas!"

As the ritual progresses, the practitioner incorporates personalized sigils drawn in the air, strengthening their connection to the invoked energies. **They repeat the Illuminist's Oath**:

"By the eternal mystery of the Black Cauldron,
By the serpentine wisdom of the ages,
I pledge myself to the illumination of the Black Dragon,
To seek out the hidden truths of the unseen realms,
To stand in the center of the 18 Flames,
And embrace the eternal transformation."

Next, taking up the athame, the practitioner consecrates the chalice filled with red wine, symbolizing the life-force, as they recite the Consecration of the Serpent's Blood:

"As I hold the essence of power and transformation,
I consecrate this vessel in the name of the Black Dragon,
May this blood empower me with the wisdom of serpents,
And the light of the celestial fire."

With the consecration complete, the practitioner drinks from the chalice.

Extending both arms to the heavens, the practitioner gives thanks to the powerful energies of the 18 Flames and the supportive eternal Serpent, before closing the ceremony with these words:

"Through the divine unity of the Serpent and the Flame,
The wisdom of the Black Dragon is forged within me.
I emerge transformed and enlightened.
In gratitude, I release the forces of the 18 Flames.
May their blessing echo through the cosmos."

With the ritual completed, the practitioner carefully extinguishes the candles, clears the sacred space, and closes the circle, fully embracing the potent energies that have been invoked.
