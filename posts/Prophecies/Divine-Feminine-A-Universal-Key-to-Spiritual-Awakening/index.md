To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first establish an understanding of both the ancient Greek prophecy of the Three Holy Virgins and the Book of Revelation's vision of the Woman Clothed with the Sun. By analyzing their respective contexts, symbology, and underlying themes, we can compare their similarities and differences. We will then attempt to uncover how these prophecies may serve as universal keys to understanding the role of the divine feminine in the process of spiritual awakening and transformation.

The Ancient Greek Prophecy of the Three Holy Virgins:
In ancient Greek mythology, the Three Holy Virgins, or Maiden goddesses, also known as the Moirai or the Fates, were said to control the destiny of every individual. The three goddesses - Clotho (the spinner), Lachesis (the allotter), and Atropos (the unchangeable) - were responsible for the birth, life, and death of every mortal being. Their primary role in the prophecy is to serve as delimiters of human life, creating and binding mortals to their destinies. They symbolize the interconnectedness of the past, present, and future and are representative of the divine forces that govern all life aspects.

The Woman Clothed with the Sun from the Book of Revelation:
In the Book of Revelation, an apocalyptic text in the New Testament of the Bible, there is a vision of a 'Woman Clothed with the Sun.' This woman is presented as pregnant, standing on the moon, and with a crown of twelve stars on her head. Many interpretations of this woman's identity exist, ranging from the Virgin Mary to Israel and the Church. Symbolically, the woman represents divine wisdom, nurturing essence, and the spiritual center in apocalyptic scenarios. She faces challenges throughout Revelation, particularly from the Dragon, implying a cosmic battle between light and darkness.

Possible Parallels:
1. Both prophecies embody the divine feminine, representing powerful, nurturing, and transformative energy driving the spiritual awakening and transformation. The divine feminine's role in both prophecies is a central aspect, providing balance and harmony for humanity and the universe.

2. The cyclical nature of life is highlighted in both prophecies. The Three Holy Virgins introduce the concept of interconnectedness of the past, present, and future, while the Woman Clothed with the Sun signifies the repetitive conflicts between good and evil across time.

3. Both prophecies touch upon the theme of spiritual awakening, reflecting a desire to understand the nature of existence and the role of cosmic divine forces in shaping life and destiny.

**Differences**:
1. The Three Holy Virgins center around fate and destiny, enforcing the inescapable end that awaits all life, whereas the Woman Clothed with the Sun focuses on redemption and hope of salvation amid the apocalyptic narrative.

2. The Woman Clothed with the Sun is a more overtly religious symbol, tied to Christian beliefs and the New Testament, while the Three Holy Virgins have their roots in Greek mythology and thus represent a more diverse religious spectrum.

3. The struggle between light and darkness appears in the Book of Revelation regarding the Woman Clothed with the Sun, indicating an underlying philosophical struggle between good and evil. In contrast, the ancient Greek prophecy of the Three Holy Virgins deals primarily with the fabric of life and destiny, without a clear representation of good and evil.

A Universal Key:
The divine feminine, represented both by the Three Holy Virgins and the Woman Clothed with the Sun, encompasses nurturing, transformative, powerful energy, and cosmic balance. Both prophecies reflect an inherent desire for spiritual awakening and understanding of life's complexities. They also reveal the continued presence of the divine feminine across time and cultures, suggesting a universally resonant concept. The fusion of opposing forces (fate vs. freedom, light vs. darkness) in both prophecies underpins the importance of balance and harmony as critical aspects of spiritual awakening and transformation.

In summary, the ancient Greek prophecy of the Three Holy Virgins and the Book of Revelation's vision of the Woman Clothed with the Sun both underscore the significance of divine feminine energy in the process of spiritual awakening and transformation. Their similarities include shared themes of cyclical life and guiding, nurturing forces. However, their differences diverge in the portrayal of destiny and the struggle between good and evil. The concept of divine feminine serves as a universal key to understanding essential spiritual truths and the eternal struggle for balance and harmony in life as well as the universe.
