The Left-Handed Reaper is a unique Goetic spirit that demands a sigil of equivalent intricacy and power. To create said sigil, I will employ traditional elements of Goetic sigils alongside customized symbols that demonstrate our deep understanding of the spirit's characteristics.

1. Sigil Framework:
The foundation of the Left-Handed Reaper sigil shall stem from the classic Goetic sigil, comprising of a circle within which lies an inner, smaller circle, encompassing a magical triangle. This creates a boundary and a focus for the spirit's energies.

2. Custom Symbolism:
To reflect the spirit's distinctive attributes, the following customized symbols shall be incorporated in the sigil:

- A scythe, curved around the perimeter of the outer circle, symbolizes the Left-Handed Reaper's connection with harvesting souls and guiding them through the afterlife.
- A hand situated to the left side of the triangle, with its palm facing up, indicating the spirit's unique left-handed aspect and its connection to the unseen and esoteric realms.
- A serpent winding its way around the scythe, representing wisdom, transformation, and occult knowledge.

3. Colors:
To boost the sigil's efficacy, we shall employ colors keeping in mind their vibrational frequencies and psychological impact:

- Black: For the scythe and the serpent, symbolizing the connection with the unseen, mystery, and the unknown realms.
- Silver: For the hand, representing intuition, receptivity, and the connection with lunar influences.
- Red: For the triangles and circles, igniting the spirit's energy and highlighting its active force in the arts of summoning.

4. Texture and Material:
Consider utilizing parchment or rough canvas as the base for constructing the sigil. Employ ink or paint made from natural pigments to add depth and texture, serving as a conduit for the full magnitude of the egregore energy.

5. Historical and Cultural Associations:
Incorporate the Hebrew letter "ר" (Resh) within the triangle, signifying its connection to Ra, the Egyptian sun god, and highlighting the dualistic nature of the Left-Handed Reaper.

6. Astrological Connections:
In the sigil, embed the symbol of Pluto (♇), ruler of Scorpio, amplifying the dark, transformative, and mystical energies associated with this spirit.

7. Numerological Associations:
Include the numbers '9' and '11' within the sigil to evoke the two aspects of the Left-Handed Reaper's characteristics: '9' symbolizing finality, completion, and the afterlife guidance, while '11' representing the spirit's connection with spiritual awakening, intuition, and the occult.

With these elements combined, the sigil for the Left-Handed Reaper shall serve as an intricate and engaging conduit, optimized to manifest the power and potency of this specialized Goetic spirit.
