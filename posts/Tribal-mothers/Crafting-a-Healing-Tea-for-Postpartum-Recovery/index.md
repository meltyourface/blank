Ceremonial Herbal Mixture: Nurturing Embrace

**Ingredients**:
1. Red Raspberry Leaf (Rubus idaeus) - 2 tablespoons
2. Nettle Leaf (Urtica dioica) - 1 tablespoon
3. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) - 1 teaspoon
4. Chickweed (Stellaria media) - 1 teaspoon
5. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) - 1/2 teaspoon
6. Rose petals (Rosa spp.) - 2 teaspoons
7. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - 1/2 teaspoon

Step-by-Step Preparation Ritual:

1. Begin by preparing a sacred space in which to create the herbal mixture. Cleanse the area and arrange a comfortable seat or cushion. Light a candle to signify the warmth of the mother's love and burn a bundle of sage to purify the atmosphere.

2. As you prepare to blend the herbs, set your intention for healing and rejuvenation for the tribal mother, focusing on her emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being.

3. In a large bowl, combine the red raspberry leaf and nettle leaf. As you do so, envision the strength of the Earth and the love of the tribe supporting the mother's body.

**Symbolism**: Red raspberry leaf nurtures the reproductive system, while nettle leaf provides essential nutrients, replenishing the mother's body after labor.

4. Add the yarrow and chickweed to the bowl, calling upon the healing prowess of these powerful plants to mend any physical and emotional wounds the mother may have sustained.

**Symbolism**: Yarrow helps to balance hormones and support the immune system, while chickweed promotes tissue repair and overall vitality.

5. Sprinkle in the lavender and rose petals, infusing the mixture with loving energy and emotional balance.

**Symbolism**: Lavender calms the mind, relieving stress and tension, while rose petals open the heart, allowing for deeper bonding between mother and child.

6. Complete the herbal blend by adding mugwort, invoking the spiritual protection of the ancestors and tribal spirits.

**Symbolism**: Mugwort enhances intuition and connects the mother to her ancestral wisdom, empowering her in her new role.

7. Gently mix the herbs in the bowl with your hands, feeling their energy melding together as you infuse the blend with your prayers and positive intentions for the new mother.

8. Transfer the completed herbal mixture into an airtight container and label it "Nurturing Embrace."

Guidance on Consumption:

1. To prepare the infusion, place 1-2 tablespoons of the herbal mixture in a teapot or infuser. Pour 2 cups of boiling water over the herbs, cover, and allow to steep for 10-15 minutes.

2. Encourage the new mother to consume 1-2 cups of the infusion daily, beginning within the first few days after giving birth. The tea is most effective when consumed regularly for the first six weeks postpartum.

3. For optimal results, the mother should sip the infusion mindfully, allowing herself to connect with the loving, nurturing energy infused within the blend and reflecting upon her powerful journey into motherhood. This process of reflection and connection will aid in the complete recovery and maternal empowerment the infusion is designed to bring.
