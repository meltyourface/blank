In hallowed halls of rose-hued gold,
Where sweet ambrosia doth unfold,
A song of beauty now is told,
To Aphrodite, love's stronghold.

Goddess adorned in shells and grace,
Whose sovereign smile births love's embrace,
Shining bright, no veil to hide,
Her presence woven in love's tide.

Eyes of waning crescent moons,
Proclaim desire's whispered tunes,
In Her visage the suns do rise,
Bathing mortals in love's prize.

Her hair cascades like golden streams,
Weaving dreams and ardent schemes,
A gilded crown upon her head,
To rule the realms where love is wed.

Beneath her feet, a crimson shell,
From which pure passion rose and fell,
Speaks the language of the tide,
A siren's song sung far and wide.

How delicate the tapestry,
Of beauty's hallowed filigree,
Feminine grace, divine and dear,
Intricately drawn in love's sweet sphere.

In every curve and tender line,
The essence of Her art divine,
Upon these gentle forms bestowed,
A living canvas, heaven sowed.

Through mortal veins, her influence runs,
To awaken hearts till day is done,
A gentle touch, a sighing breeze,
Love's many shapes, She ever sees.

Sing we now of Her ethereal grace,
In words of lilac and feathered lace,
The twilight hue of adoration,
A love-imbued incantation.

O Aphrodite, hear our plea,
Enraptured in Thy mystery,
Guide us in Thy golden realm,
Where tender love doth overwhelm.

With sculpted wand, She wields her power,
In every moment, every hour,
Her art perfected, beauty's reign,
All earthly forms her matchless claim.

Let bards and painters cease their strife,
For in her image, lies true life,
The essence of all earthly grace,
Bound within her warm embrace.

By Aphrodite's sacred hand,
Feminine beauty graced this land,
In heavens and skies, Her stars align,
An everlasting love divine.
