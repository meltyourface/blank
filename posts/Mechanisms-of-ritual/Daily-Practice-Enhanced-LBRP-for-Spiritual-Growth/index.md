In order to develop a comprehensive daily practice focusing on the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP), the following steps are recommended:

1. Preparations: Begin by cleansing and purifying the ritual space. This can be done with the use of incense, such as frankincense or sage. Next, ground yourself by sitting in a comfortable position and practicing deep, rhythmic breathing. Visualize your energy connecting with the earth below you, releasing any negativity or distractions from your mind, and reaching for a relaxed yet focused state.

2. Ritual attire and tools: Dress in a ceremonial robe or garment reserved for ritual use. Additionally, you may want to obtain and consecrate a ritual dagger (athame) or wand for tracing pentagrams in the air. Prepare representations of the elemental pentagrams for each quarter (earth, air, fire, and water), ensuring that they are accurately and visibly displayed.

3. Personalized invocation: Compose a heartfelt and unique invocation to the four elemental archangels: Raphael (air), Gabriel (water), Michael (fire), and Auriel (earth). This invocation can follow any poetic structure as long as it respectfully asks for their guidance and protection during the ritual. Recite this invocation aloud at the beginning of your practice, facing the appropriate direction for each archangel (east for Raphael, west for Gabriel, south for Michael, and north for Auriel).

4. Qabalistic Cross: Standing with your arms outstretched, touch your forehead, intoning "Ateh" (meaning "Thou art"). Touch your solar plexus, intoning "Malkuth" (meaning "the Kingdom"). Touch your right shoulder, intoning "ve-Geburah" (meaning "and the Power"), and then your left shoulder, intoning "ve-Gedulah" (meaning "and the Glory"). Clasp your hands together at chest level, intoning "le-Olam, Amen" (meaning "forever, Amen"). Visualize a beam of light descending and ascending along your spine as you perform these actions, connecting you with the divine and the earthly realms.

5. Invoking and banishing pentagrams: Facing east, trace a blue banishing pentagram of air with your ritual dagger or wand. Envision the pentagram glowing as you intone the god name "YHVH" (pronounced "Yod Heh Vav Heh"). Follow the same process for the other quarters, using a blue pentagram for air (east), a green pentagram for water (west), a red pentagram for fire (south), and a black pentagram for earth (north).

6. Integration and alignment: Throughout the ritual, maintain a heightened awareness of the intent and purpose of the LBRP. Synchronize your intellectual understanding, emotional attunement, and somatic involvement as you visualize and trace the pentagrams, ensuring that each action is performed with intention and care.

7. Conclusion: Revisit the personalized invocation, this time expressing your gratitude to the archangels and elemental energies for their guidance and protection during the ritual. Once complete, conduct grounding exercises, such as deep breathing and visualization of energy returning to the earth, before closing your daily practice.

With dedicated adherence to these enriched guidelines, you can expect a deeper and more fulfilling daily practice centered around the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, enhancing your mastery of esoteric and occult Mechanisms of the ritual.
