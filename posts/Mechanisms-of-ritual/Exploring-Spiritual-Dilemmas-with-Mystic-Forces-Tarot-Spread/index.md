Introducing the "Mystic Forces Tarot Spread," a 13-card spread designed to unravel the intricate layers and potential outcomes of a multifaceted dilemma involving the interplay of spiritual forces. The spread is laid out in the shape of a pentagram within a circle, symbolizing the union of spirit, earth, air, fire, and water, while the circle represents the universe encompassing all elements. Each card denotes a step in the sequence and has its specific position within the spread.

The Arrangement of the Mystic Forces Tarot Spread

1. The querent's current situation and state of mind - Placed at the top of the pentagram, in the center of the circle, it represents the starting point in the center of the universe, serving as a foundation for the reading.
 
2. The primary spiritual force influencing the situation - Placed at the eastern point of the pentagram, it represents the air element as the breath of spiritual guidance.

3. An occult barrier hindering the querent's progress - Positioned at the western point, opposite to card 2, symbolizing the opposing force and signifies the water element as a hidden challenge deep within the subconscious.

4. A hidden ally or beneficial energy source - Placed at the top-right point of the pentagram, symbolizing the connection between the querent's position and the spiritual influence, highlighting the fiery energy and guidance.

5. The querent's dominant strength that should be harnessed - Positioned at the bottom left point, representing the earth element, connected to the querent and hidden ally, expressing practicality and rooted wisdom.

6. A shadow aspect or unconscious trait that needs addressing - Placed directly below card 1, though within the circle as a representation of the polar opposite, hinting at the hidden aspects of the querent that need to be faced.

7. An immediate action to be taken influenced by a specific ritual - Positioned on the circle, halfway between cards 2 and 3, to symbolize the action drawing on both spiritual forces and occult barriers.

8. An alternative, less favorable path to avoid - Placed on the circle, halfway between cards 4 and 5, illustrating potential misguided steps by misreading the positive and powerful influences.

9. A symbolic representation of the outcome if the current course remains unchanged - Positioned at the northern point of the pentagram, marking the spirit element as a reminder that transformation requires understanding and action.

10. The likely outcome if suggested actions are undertaken - Placed on the circle, below card 9, as the outcome grounded in the transformative energy of the spirit realm.

11. Spiritual guidance from a principal archetype/figure - Positioned to the left, outside the circle, as an external source of wisdom and supernatural guidance from the spirit realm.

12. An underlying theme or connection to a past life lesson - Placed to the right, outside the circle, highlighting the past life energies that inform the present situation.

13. An unexpected element that may prove influential in the situation's resolution - Positioned beneath card 1, outside of the circle, this card serves as an unforeseen energy or revelation that could alter the course of events.

The interactions between the cards and their placements within the spread are designed to emphasize their relationships. The outer circle represents the universality, while the pentagram brings balance and harmony to the reading.

The Mystic Forces Tarot Spread provides a comprehensive framework for exploring the spiritual, mental, and practical dimensions of a multifaceted dilemma. By using this spread, the querent can achieve profound insights into the esoteric forces at play and uncover the paths leading to a successful resolution.
