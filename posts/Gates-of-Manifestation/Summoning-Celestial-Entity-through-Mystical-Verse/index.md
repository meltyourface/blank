Through the Gates of Manifestation, wherein lies
The boundless cosmos and the mystic skies,
I call upon Thee, O Essence of Creation,
To grace this sacred space with Thy divine vibration.

In the language of the stars and ancient runes,
In rhyming verse, my reverent soul entunes,
Unlock the cosmic doorways, reveal what lies within,
Transcend the realms of mortal earth, and birth the truth again.

O Guardian of the Sacred Key, divulge the worlds unknown,
Rise from depths of the Abyss, and on Thy gilded throne,
Preside o'er this humble space, unfurl Thy web of dreams,
Illuminate the shadowed path, with argent lunar beams.

To honor Thee, borne offerings upon a silver plate,
Celestial essence of the stars, and incense that blooms innate,
The sacred crescent: lodestone pure, to draw Thee to our sphere,
To pierce the veil, traverse the miles, and plant Thy presence here.

In seething cauldron, where molten fire dwells,
We brew an elixir, conjured by ancient spells,
An herb of might, a crystal's core, and currents of the sea,
This potion we present to Thee, conjured in harmony.

Erotic dance and haunting chants, crafted to seduce,
O Wyrd Weaver, we call to Thee, and free Thy noose,
Fill us with the primal force, a sempiternal weave,
From the gates of dark matter, esoteric blessings we conceive.

By midnight's toll and candle's flicker, I summon from the mist,
Chosen deity, entity, or force, within this realm persist,
With heartfelt plea and pentacle, etched resolute in power,
I stand before the Ages' course and in Thy truth, I cower.

Hear my words, O Great Unknown, a catalyst in time,
Bind our lives with astral threads, harmonize and chime,
Awaken us to omnipotence, bestow immortal grace,
With every shining step we take, our sacred paths retrace.

Completed now, the sacred poem, from which the mysteries rise,
Tempest forged, and twilight touched, a pure celestial guise,
Through the Gates of Manifestation, these verses boldly hail,
Open now the cosmic portal, empower us to prevail.
