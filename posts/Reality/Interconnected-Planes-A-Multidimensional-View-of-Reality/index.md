excerpt: >

  - The physical plane is separate and distinct from the astral and mental planes, with no influence between them
  
  - The astral and mental planes exist only as subjective experiences and have no bearing on the physical world
  
  - The physical, astral, and mental planes are interconnected, with experiences and influences flowing between them, manifesting as synchronicities and energetic shifts in reality

The answer is: The physical, astral, and mental planes are interconnected, with experiences and influences flowing between them, manifesting as synchronicities and energetic shifts in reality.

In the esoteric understanding of Reality, the concept of interconnected planes of existence forms a fundamental backbone. According to this viewpoint, the physical plane, astral plane, and mental plane are all layers of reality that coexist and influence one another.

The physical plane corresponds to the tangible world around us. It encompasses everything we can perceive with our five senses, including our own bodies. The astral plane, on the other hand, is more subtle and ephemeral. It is a realm of emotion, intuition, and psychic energies. The mental plane is the realm of thought, ideas, and higher consciousness.

These planes are not entirely separate worlds but rather interconnected dimensions that bleed into one another. This interconnectivity allows for experiences, energies, and influences to flow between them. As energy moves between the planes, manifestations in the physical world, such as synchronicities and energetic shifts in reality, can occur. Synchronicities are meaningful coincidences that are believed to be a product of the integration between these planes.

This interplay among the physical, astral, and mental planes is a crucial concept in many spiritual, mystical, and esoteric traditions. For example, in Hermetic philosophy, the Emerald Tablet (a foundational text attributed to Hermes Trismegistus) states, "As above, so below; as within, so without." This maxim highlights how the macrocosm (higher planes of existence) and microcosm (individual experience) are reflections of each other.

The idea of interconnected planes can also be found in the teachings of Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism. The Kabbalistic Tree of Life symbolizes the structure of both the universe and human consciousness, with ten spheres (Sefirot) representing different aspects of creation and awareness. These spheres are connected by pathways representing energetic relationships, further illustrating the complex network of experiences between the various planes.

In conclusion, the esoteric conception of Reality recognizes that existence is multidimensional and deeply interconnected. The physical, astral, and mental planes are all essential components of this broader Reality, and their interconnectivity allows for synchronicities, energetic shifts, and a greater understanding of the intricate tapestry of existence.
