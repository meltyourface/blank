## Hierophant's Enochian Angelic Invocation 

Introduction:
This comprehensive Enochian ritual incorporates the specialized language, sigils, and symbols specific to the occult Hierophant domain to powerfully invoke angelic communication. The document will provide detailed steps to prepare the sacred space, select and consecrate ritual tools, and the proper sequence of employing the Enochian Calls and Keys. Additionally, all aspects of the specific angelic hierarchy and entities to be contacted, their associated sigils, and the intended purpose of the communication will be elaborated.

### I. Preparation of the Sacred Space
1. **Cleansing and Purification**: Cleanse and purify the designated ritual space by burning sage or sandalwood incense to dispel any negative energy.
2. **Circle of Protection**: Draw a circle of pentagrams, nine feet in diameter, using white chalk or sea salt. This circle serves as the boundary of the sacred space, protecting the practitioner during the invocation.
3. **Invocation of the Divine**: Call upon the divine power, be it God, the Source, or the Universe, to illuminate and protect your sacred space.

### II. Selection and consecration of ritual tools
1. **Wand**: The wand represents the element of Fire and the power of creativity. Choose a wand made of oak or ash and consecrate it by passing it through the smoke of the incense.
2. **Chalice**: The chalice represents the element of Water and the power of intuition. Choose a chalice made of silver or glass and consecrate it by rinsing with purified water.
3. **Athame**: The athame represents the element of Air and the power of intellect. Choose an athame with a double-edged blade and consecrate it by anointing it with a drop of olive oil.
4. **Pentacle**: The pentacle represents the element of Earth and the power of manifestation. Choose a pentacle made of clay, wood or metal and consecrate it by sprinkling a bit of earth upon it.

### III. The Enochian Calls and Keys
1. **The First Call**: Addresses the elemental kings and invokes the powers of the Air Tablet. Recite the First Call, which starts with "Ol sonuf vaoresaji..."
2. **The Second Call**: Addresses the governing angels of the Watchtowers. Recite the Second Call, which starts with "Adgt vpaah zong..."
3. **The Third to the Eighteenth Calls**: Specified invocations for the angelic hierarchy and entities within each sub-quadrant. Choose the appropriate Call(s) based on the entities you wish to contact.

### IV. Angelic Hierarchy and Entities
1. **The Archangels**: Michael (Fire), Raphael (Air), Gabriel (Water), and Uriel (Earth). Invoke these four archangels to oversee and protect the ritual.
2. **Elemental Princes**: Specific to each of the elemental tablets (Air, Water, Earth, and Fire), select the corresponding princes (such as Ra'ashe'el for the Air Tablet) and use their sigils for invocation.

### V. Purpose of Communication
State the purpose of the communication clearly and concisely, ensuring that it aligns with your true intentions and higher good. This invocation may be performed for the purposes of spiritual growth, acquiring wisdom, or seeking guidance from the angelic realm.

### VI. Closing the Ritual
1. **Express gratitude**: Thank the angelic entities and Archangels for their presence and assistance during the ritual.
2. **Dismissal of Entities**: Bid all invoked entities to depart in peace and return to their respective realms.
3. **Dismantling the Circle of Protection**: Erase the circle and pentagrams to symbolize the closing of the sacred space.
4. **Grounding and Energizing**: Ground your energy by reconnecting with the Earth and its elements to balance your energy.
