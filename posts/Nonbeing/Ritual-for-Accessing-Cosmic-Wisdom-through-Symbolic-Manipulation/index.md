description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Nonbeing, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design an intricate ritual for harnessing the enigmatic powers of Nonbeing to tap into the collective unconscious wisdom of the ethereal realms. Incorporate precise steps and materials, such as candles of specific colors, mystical symbols to be drawn on parchment with quill and ink, and invocations or chants uttered in the language of ancients. Ensure the ritual engages multiple senses and dimensions, reflecting the elaborate nature of the domain. Additionally, create a safeguard mechanism within the ritual to protect the practitioner from potential disturbances or ill-effects arising from delving into the unknown depths of Nonbeing. Experiment with the incorporation of astrological alignments, numerology, and aspects of quantum thought to augment the potency of the ritual, and provide justification for the chosen elements.

## Ritus Abditus Sapientiae

**Phase 1: Preparation**

Step 1: Choose a date and time for the ritual when Jupiter is in alignment with Neptune, as these celestial bodies symbolize wisdom, knowledge, and the mysterious realms. Ensure the Moon is in its waxing gibbous phase to enhance the influence of intuitive insights.

Step 2: Prepare a sacred space, ideally a circular room lined with mirrors to reflect and amplify the energies. The ritual must only be performed in absolute darkness, ensuring that the practitioner's senses are heightened.

Step 3: Gather the required materials:
- Five candles of different colors: blue, indigo, green, silver, and gold, signifying the unlocking of various aspects of the ethereal realms and Nonbeing.
- Five parchment sheets, a quill, and ink made from the ashes of mystical herbs.
- A round, onyx dish in which to place the parchments.
- A red silk cloth to cover the dish.
- An incense blend of sandalwood, myrrh, and frankincense, representing the harmonious connection with the collective unconscious.

**Phase 2: Creation of the Mystical Symbols**

Step 1: Begin by drawing five mystical symbols on the parchments, each with a unique representation:
- Symbol 1: The Seed of Life, representing the origin of all creation.
- Symbol 2: The Eye of Providence, symbolizing divine insight and protection.
- Symbol 3: The Lemniscate, representing the concept of infinity and boundless wisdom.
- Symbol 4: The Ouroboros, symbolizing cyclicality and eternal renewal.
- Symbol 5: The Merkaba, representing multidimensional awareness and ascension.

Step 2: Place the parchments on the onyx dish and cover it with the red silk cloth.

**Phase 3: Initiation of the Ritual**

Step 1: Arrange the candles in a quintessence formation, with each corner represented by the colored candle, and the silver candle in the center.

Step 2: Light the incense and place it at the center of the room.

Step 3: Seat yourself cross-legged in the center, before the onyx dish and candles.

Step 4: Begin by reciting the ancient Invocation of Lunaria (an ancient language that predates known civilizations), to channel the energies of the Moon, celestial bodies, and Nonbeing.

Step 5: Visualize yourself enveloped in a golden protective aura, shielding you from any negative disturbances.

**Phase 4: The Unveiling of the Symbols**

Step 1: Uncover the onyx dish and, one by one, hold up each parchment, chanting the corresponding Mantra of Revelation in the language of Lunaria. Meditate briefly on each symbol.

Step 2: Once all symbols have been unveiled, lay the parchments back onto the onyx dish and cover them with the red silk cloth.

**Phase 5: Completion of the Ritual**

Step 1: Extinguish the candles in reverse order as they were lit, sealing the energies invoked.

Step 2: Fold the red silk cloth with the parchments inside and store them in a safe, dark place until the next ritual.

Step 3: Thank the ethereal beings for their wisdom bestowed and close the space.

Through this elaborate and intricate ritual, the practitioner will attune to the deep collective unconscious wisdom and the enigmatic powers of Nonbeing. The chosen symbols, alignment of celestial bodies, and sacred materials will augment the potency of the ritual, while the protective aura and closing sequence will ensure the practitioner's safety from any harm or disturbances. The practitioner is encouraged to revisit this ritual as necessary to maintain a strong connection with the ethereal realms and to continue learning from their wisdom.
