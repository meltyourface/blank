The correct answer is Orphism.

Orphism was a religious and philosophical movement in Ancient Greece that was primarily concerned with the attainment of inner spiritual knowledge and the ultimate transcendence of the material world. Orphism can be distinguished from the other philosophical and religious movements mentioned in the question - Sophism, Epicureanism, and Stoicism - by its unique emphasis on the mystical experience and the quest for salvation through the soul's detachment from the physical world.

Orphism originated in the 6th century BCE and was influenced by earlier traditions such as Pythagoreanism and earlier mystery religions. It was named after the mythical poet and musician Orpheus, who was believed to be the founder of the movement. The core belief of Orphism was the immortality and divine nature of the human soul. Orphists believed that the soul was trapped in the material world through a cycle of death and rebirth and could only be liberated through knowledge and spiritual purification.

The Orphic cosmogony, which is the creation myth of the Orphics, presented an intricate story of the genesis of the universe, the gods, and human beings. Orphism had a particular focus on the symbolism and meanings of myths, and they interpreted mythological stories as allegories for the soul's journey and transformation.

In contrast, Sophism was a philosophical movement that emerged in the 5th century BCE and taught the art of rhetoric, persuasion, and argumentation. Sophists were known for their skepticism toward traditional values and commonly held beliefs, and they did not focus on spiritual knowledge or the transcendence of the material world.

Epicureanism, founded by Epicurus in the 4th century BCE, was a hedonistic philosophy that advocated for the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. While Epicureans did emphasize the importance of personal tranquility and freedom from fear, they believed that these goals could be achieved through understanding and satisfying one's basic desires, rather than through mystical experiences or spiritual transformation.

Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BCE, was a philosophical movement that focused on the mastery of one's emotions and the cultivation of virtue. Stoicism taught that happiness could be attained by living a life according to reason and in harmony with nature, which entailed the acceptance of the inevitability of suffering and the impermanence of the material world. While Stoicism shared some similarities with Orphism in its emphasis on detachment from the material world, Stoics did not place as much emphasis on the mystical experience or the belief in the divine nature of the human soul.

In summary, Orphism is the philosophical and religious movement that was mainly concerned with the attainment of inner spiritual knowledge and the ultimate transcendence of the material world, setting it apart from the other options mentioned in the prompt.
