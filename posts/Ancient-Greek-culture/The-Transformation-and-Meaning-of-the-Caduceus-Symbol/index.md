To analyze the transformation of the caduceus in Ancient Greek culture, we must first delve into its historical origins. The caduceus is a symbol comprising a winged staff with two serpents intertwined around it, often attributed to the Greek god Hermes. However, similar symbols can be traced back to earlier civilizations, such as Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. Throughout history, the caduceus has undergone significant philosophical, alchemical, and mythological transformations that have played a crucial role in shaping occultism and esotericism in contemporary society. 

Philosophical Aspects:

In Ancient Greece, the caduceus was associated with Hermes (also known as Mercury in Roman mythology), who was the messenger of the gods, a psychopomp, and a patron of various fields, including commerce, language, and magic. Philosophically, Hermes represented the embodiment of communication and the transmission of knowledge between realms – the divine and the mortal, as well as the conscious and the unconscious. The caduceus itself symbolizes the union of opposites, the balance of forces, and the art of mediation. 

In the philosophical field, the figure of Hermes heavily influenced the development of Hermeticism. Featuring in numerous writings such as the Corpus Hermeticum, Hermes is presented as a wise sage who imparts profound insights to humanity. Through his association with the caduceus, some of these teachings delve into the mystery of duality, the reconciliation of opposing forces, and the fundamental unity of existence. These themes have transcended time, playing a pivotal role in modern esoteric thought.

Alchemical Aspects:

Alchemically, the two serpents entwined around the staff of the caduceus bear a strong resemblance to the concept of the Ouroboros, which is a symbol of a serpent or a dragon eating its own tail. Traditionally seen as representing the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth, the Ouroboros is intrinsically connected to the transmutation processes in alchemy.

The caduceus, too, symbolizes the duality and balance necessary for the spiritual and physical transformation sought by alchemists. The two serpents represent the dual aspects of existence – the masculine and the feminine, the active and the passive, or the solar and the lunar. The intertwining of these forces leads to a balance which facilitates the alchemical process. In addition, the winged aspect of the caduceus signifies the elevation of the soul and the ascension towards spiritual enlightenment.

Mythological Aspects:

From a mythological standpoint, the caduceus’ two intertwining serpents can be traced back to the Greek myth of Tiresias, a blind prophet who was transformed into a woman for seven years after accidentally encountering two copulating snakes. The gender fluidity and transformative aspects of this myth align with the central theme of the caduceus, which is the merging and mediation of opposite forces and the subsequent transformation that ensues.

Influence on Contemporary Occultism and Esotericism:

Throughout history, the caduceus has been adopted by various esoteric and occult traditions. For example, in the mystical tradition of Kabbalah, the caduceus represents the balancing of forces within the Tree of Life and the attainment of higher consciousness. In many Western esoteric schools, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Rosicrucian Order, the caduceus is used to symbolize initiation, spiritual ascent, and the discovery of hidden knowledge.

Moreover, the caduceus serves as a representation of the awakened Kundalini energy in Eastern esoteric traditions. Kundalini, often symbolized by a coiled serpent, lies dormant at the base of the spine until it is awakened through various spiritual practices. Once awakened, it rises through the body's energy centers, or chakras, ultimately leading to spiritual enlightenment. 

In conclusion, the caduceus constitutes an amalgamation of philosophical, alchemical, and mythological aspects in Ancient Greek culture. Its themes of mediation, balance, and transformation have profoundly influenced our contemporary understanding of occultism and esotericism. By embodying the union of opposites, the process of awakening hidden knowledge, and the ultimate ascension of the human spirit, the caduceus has transcended time and remains a powerful symbol in the world of esoteric wisdom today.
