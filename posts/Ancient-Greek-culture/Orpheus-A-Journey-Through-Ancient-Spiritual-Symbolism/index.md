To comprehensively respond to this knowledge challenge, we need to delve into the myth of Orpheus and its connections to the Eleusinian Mysteries, the journey of the soul, and Platonic dualism. We will then explore the influence of Pythagoreanism and theurgy on these concepts.

Orpheus, a celebrated poet and musician in Greek mythology, is best known for his journey to the underworld to recover his wife, Eurydice. The myth of Orpheus presents a rich tapestry of symbolism that links to Ancient Greek culture, occult practices, and philosophical origins. Orpheus's descent into and return from the underworld can be viewed through the lens of initiation, transformation, and the divine union of opposites.

The Eleusinian Mysteries were initiation ceremonies held annually in the city of Eleusis, near Athens, honoring Demeter, goddess of agriculture, and her daughter Persephone, who had been abducted by Hades, the god of the underworld. These mysteries focused on the cycle of death and rebirth and can be interconnected with the tale of Orpheus. Both stories reveal the importance of overcoming human attachments, honoring the divine, and illustrate a transformative journey of the soul.

Comparing Orpheus' journey to the soul's journey in the esoteric tradition allows us to examine the theme of descent and ascent. According to Platonic dualism, the world is divided into two realms – the world of Forms, or Ideas, which is eternal and unchangeable, and the physical world, which is temporary and mutable. The soul, originating from the world of Forms, descends into the material world and becomes trapped in the body. Orpheus's descent into the underworld and his quest to reunite with Eurydice can be seen as the soul's journey back to its divine origins through purification, enlightenment, and reunification with the eternal essence.

Pythagoreanism, an influential school of philosophy founded by Pythagoras, also contributes to these concepts. Central tenets of Pythagoreanism include the harmony of opposites, the transmigration of souls, and the importance of music and mathematics in apprehending the hidden order of the cosmos. Orpheus, a skillful musician whose lyre could charm both gods and beasts, embodies Pythagorean ideals connecting music to the divine harmony of the cosmos and the power of attunement. Transmigration of souls can also be seen in both Orpheus’s journey and the Eleusinian Mysteries, which prepare initiates for posthumous existence.

Theurgy, an occult practice and set of spiritual exercises aiming to invoke the divine presence and power of the gods, is another element that connects with the Orpheus myth and the Eleusinian Mysteries. Theurgical practices employed by Neoplatonist philosophers, like Iamblichus, sought to reconcile the Platonic and Pythagorean doctrines with ritualistic and mystical experiences, paving the way for personal transcendence. Orpheus's ability to charm the gods and reconcile opposites using his music demonstrates theurgical principles and illustrates the role of divine intervention within the human journey towards enlightenment and ascension.

In conclusion, the myth of Orpheus, through its multifaceted symbolism, can be analyzed within the contexts of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the journey of the soul, and Platonic dualism. It offers vital insights into Ancient Greek culture, occult practices, and the philosophical underpinnings of esotericism. The synthesis of Pythagoreanism and theurgy provides a harmonious understanding of how these interconnected concepts influenced the ancient world and the evolving spiritual paradigm. The allegory of Orpheus encapsulates the essence of personal transformation, divine harmony, and the eternal quest for enlightenment that persistently permeates throughout human existence.
