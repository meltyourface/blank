Aleister Crowley, born Edward Alexander Crowley (October 12, 1875 - December 1, 1947), was an influential British occultist, mystic, writer, and social provocateur, often referred to as "The Great Beast 666" and the "Master Therion." He remains one of the most enigmatic and controversial figures in the study of the esoteric. This analysis attempts to provide a detailed commentary on his character as portrayed by various biographers, focusing on discerning historically accurate accounts and demystifying some of the mythologies surrounding the man and his works.

Major life events and experiences with the occult:

Crowley's strict upbringing in the exclusive Plymouth Brethren sect, combined with the early loss of his father, instilled in him a deep-rooted antipathy for Christianity. This familial turmoil undoubtedly influenced his future path. Seeking solace in mountaineering and later discovering the world of the occult, Crowley became highly skilled in the practice of ceremonial magick and mystical experiences.

In 1898, Crowley became a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which marked the beginning of his deep exploration of magick and the development of his own system of Thelemic occultism. Throughout his life, Crowley claimed a series of magical and mystical experiences, such as his reception of the Book of the Law in 1904, which signaled the dawn of a new Aeon, where humanity would rediscover and reignite its innate divine strength.

Analyzing his motives, inner demons, and spiritual pursuits: 

Various interpretations of Crowley's motives exist among biographers; some view him as an unscrupulous charlatan while others consider him a visionary seeker of esoteric truth. Despite his apparent appetite for notoriety and ability to create controversy, a critical examination suggests that Crowley was driven by an earnest desire to discover and experience a deeper reality beyond the conventional boundaries of his time.

Several biographers, such as Lawrence Sutin and Tobias Churton, argue that Crowley held sincere beliefs in magick, which were often distorted by scandalized media attention. It is worth noting, however, that Crowley's voracious appetites for sex, drugs, and tumult do point to an intense inner struggle against the repressive confines of his era. Ultimately, any analysis of his motives remains speculative, burdened by the weight of personal biases and the complexity of his personality.

Personal relationships that shaped his psyche:

Throughout his life, Crowley engaged in numerous romantic and sexual relationships with both men and women, which undoubtedly informed his core philosophical tenet of "Do what thou wilt." However, the underlying theme of abandonment and impermanence permeated these liaisons, eliciting a sense of unresolved desire and, at times, bitterness.

Lesser-known, arcane aspects of his life:

Crowley immersed himself in the study of obscure and diverse magical systems, such as the Enochian magick of John Dee and Edward Kelley, and the lore of the Knights Templar. These eclectic interests enabled him to synthesize an overarching framework for his own system, Thelema.

During his time with the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), Crowley contributed substantially, expanding its initiatory system and integrating Thelemic principles. This work, though often overshadowed by his personal life, remains an important aspect of his role as an occult innovator.

In conclusion, understanding Aleister Crowley's character necessitates a discerning and critical appraisal of various biographical accounts, tempered by a willingness to delve into the less-publicized aspects of his life. Only then can we begin to grasp the enigmatic interplay between Crowley's psychological demons, spiritual pursuits, and the extraordinary influence he continues to exert on modern-day esotericism.
