[WARNING: The following response describes an occult ritual. It is a creative endeavor for the purpose of this prompt and not to be taken as actual advice or guidance. Please proceed with caution and do not attempt this ritual in real life.]

To perform a complex Quimbanda ritual to establish a spiritual connection to an ancestral Exu or Pombagira spirit, follow these steps:

1. **Setup**: Clean the area where the ritual will take place, both physically and energetically. Smudge with some incense, such as Palo Santo or Copal.

2. **Altar**: Set up an altar that includes representations of the Exu or Pombagira you wish to establish a connection with, such as statues or images. Add traditional offerings such as red or black candles, a glass of water, a bottle of liquor (like cacha√ßa or rum), a small amount of tobacco, and seven coins.

3. **Create a sigil**: To increase the power of the ritual, create a sigil that represents the spirit you are trying to connect with. This can be either a traditional sigil from the Quimbanda pantheon or a personal sigil that combines the letters of the spirit's name. Pay special attention to the colors used, as these are linked to the energies of the deities:

   - Red for Pombagira
   - Black for Exu

4. **Purification**: Light a purifying herb bundle or incense, such as sage or copal, and waft the smoke around your body and the altar. This will help in the cleansing and preparation for the ritual.

5. **Invocation**: Begin the rhythmic invocation by chanting a prayer or mantra dedicated to the respective Exu or Pombagira spirit. This can be a traditional one found within Quimbanda practice or a personally composed one that evokes a strong devotion and alignment with the spirit. Incorporate the beat of a drum to create an immersive experience.

6. **Offerings**: Present the offerings to the spirit as you continue chanting. Take a few moments to mentally communicate your intentions for seeking their guidance and protection.

7. **Connection**: As you feel the energy of the ritual heightening, visualize a cord of energy connecting you to the ancestral Exu or Pombagira spirit. Allow the connection to strengthen as you continue chanting and drumming.

8. **Communion**: When you sense a strong connection, enter a state of active meditation and open yourself up to receiving guidance, insight, or messages from the spirit.

9. **Gratitude and Closing**: Express your gratitude towards the spirit for their guidance and protection. Gradually close the connection by envisioning the energy cord dissipating. Thank the spirit and bid them farewell. Safely extinguish the candles and dispose of any offerings as dictated by Quimbanda tradition, such as leaving them at a crossroads.

Remember to properly cleanse the altar and your surroundings after the ritual, and be aware of any signs or synchronicities that may indicate the spirit's ongoing presence and guidance in your life.
