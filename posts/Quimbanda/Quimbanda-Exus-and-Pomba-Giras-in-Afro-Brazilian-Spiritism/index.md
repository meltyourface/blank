Explanation:

Quimbanda is an Afro-Brazilian religion that emerged in the early 20th century, primarily practiced in Brazil. It blends elements of African traditional religions, such as Umbanda, Candombl√©, and Macumba, with Catholicism, Kardecist Spiritism, and indigenous spirituality. Quimbanda is a spirit-centered practice with a focus on working with spiritual beings called Exus and Pomba Giras to achieve personal growth, healing, and success in various aspects of life.

Exus are considered the spirits associated with crossroads, trickery, and transformation. They are essential entities in Quimbanda because of their role in bridging the spirit and earthly worlds. The Exus help people with issues such as removing obstacles, providing protection, and offering guidance for accessing deeper levels of the subconscious, enabling spiritual evolution and self-mastery. Exus are often mistakenly seen as evil, but they are better understood as holding the dual aspects of the human experience, representing both positive and destructive qualities. Exus ensure karmic balance and are said to protect practitioners and guide them in the proper use of their magical energies.

On the other hand, Pomba Giras are female spirits embodying sensuality, desire, and female mysteries. These spirits have a deep connection with human sexuality and the divine feminine aspects. Pomba Giras are known to help individuals with matters of love, relationships, and sexual fulfillment. They are also associated with fertility, self-confidence, and personal empowerment. Pomba Giras are complex spirits, revealing the many facets of female power, and their influence can be both alluring and dangerous in matters of the heart.

Thus, the correct answer reflects the roles of Exus and Pomba Giras within Quimbanda, as spirits working to provide guidance, protection, and assistance in various aspects of a person's life. In practice, they serve as allies for practitioners to navigate the complex realms of spiritual and physical existence and accomplish their goals with wisdom and balance.
