To establish a spiritual connection to an ancestral Exu or Pombagira spirit in the realm of Quimbanda, we will perform the following ritual, incorporating specific offerings, traditionally used sigils, and rhythmic invocations. Before beginning, it is important to have a clean and purified environment as well as having cleansed oneself spiritually.

1. **Prepare the altar**: Set up an altar with a black or red cloth, and place seven candles (red for Exus, black for Pombagiras) and an offering bowl in the center. Arrange any other ritual tools you may need, such as a knife for tracing sigils, sacred objects, and incense.

2. **Prepare the offerings**: For an Exu spirit, typically offerings include cigar, brandy, and chili pepper. For a Pombagira spirit, offerings can include roses, perfume, and lipstick. In some cases, offering animal sacrifices may be required, but for this particular ritual, we will focus on non-animal offerings to maintain a balance of moral use.

3. **Draw the sigils**: Locate the respective sigils for the specific Exu or Pombagira spirit you wish to connect with. These can be found in various traditional grimoires or online sources dedicated to Quimbanda. Draw the sigils using chalk, ash, or another appropriate substance on the floor near the altar.

4. **Begin the rhythmic invocation**: Light the candles on the altar, and begin chanting the specific invocations for the chosen Exu or Pombagira in a rhythmic manner. This may include incorporating drumming, bell-ringing, or other musical elements. The names and praise of the spirit should be repeated alongside the chanting of specific traditional prayers within the realm of Quimbanda.

5. **Welcome the spirit**: As the energy of the ritual increases, open yourself to communication with the Exu or Pombagira spirit by addressing them respectfully, announcing your intentions for the connection and asking for their guidance and protection.

6. **Present the offerings**: Carefully place the offerings in the offering bowl or near the sigils on the floor, making clear that these offerings are given in respect, gratitude, and acknowledgment of the spirit's presence and assistance.

7. **Listen and receive guidance**: Open yourself to any messages, insights, or sensations that may arise as the spirit's energy and guidance are received. This may come as visions, intuitive impressions, or physical sensations such as chills or warmth.

8. **Close the ritual**: Once you have spent adequate time in communion with the spirit and have received perceptible guidance, give thanks to the Exu or Pombagira for their presence and help. Acknowledge their guidance, extinguish the candles, and carefully discard the offerings in a respectful manner, preferably by returning them to nature. Finally, cleanse the area of the ritual and mark the conclusion by either ringing a bell, clapping your hands three times, or another traditional means of closing a ceremony.

Incorporating these steps in a ritual will establish a powerful spiritual connection to an ancestral Exu or Pombagira spirit, drawing their guidance and protection into your life's journey. By using specific offerings, sigils, and rhythmic invocations, the ritual will create a rich and immersive experience, connecting you deeply to the spirit and the Quimbanda tradition.
