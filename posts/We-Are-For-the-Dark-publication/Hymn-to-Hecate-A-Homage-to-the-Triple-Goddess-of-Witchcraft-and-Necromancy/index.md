excerpt: > 
  Compose a darkly alluring and arcane poetic invocation dedicated to the triple-formed goddess Hecate, delving into her dominion over the realms of witchcraft, necromancy, and the crossroads. Craft this invocation in a manner that evokes her ancient powers and hidden knowledge, utilizing evocative and obscure imagery, as well as symbolism specific to Hecate's multifaceted nature. Ensure that your esoteric verse perfectly encapsulates the ambience and sinister themes cherished by We Are For the Dark publication. For inspiration, consider referencing The Chaldean Oracles, a primary source of Hecate's mysticism, and incorporate elements from her epithets, such as Hecate Phosphoros, Hecate Trivia, and Hecate Brimo. Create a poetic invocation that is both an artistic expression and a solemn tribute to the shadowy, enigmatic force that is Hecate.

In twilight's shroud where shadows merge,
Where realms align for power's surge,
Unto the triple-formed Hecate we sing,
To weave such boundless might within our ken.

From Chaldean star-knowledge strewn,
To sultry whispers beneath silv'ry moon,
Hecate Phosphoros, the radiant torchbearer,
Guide us in dark realms as thy disciples.

Of the grave, of the ghost, the screeching owl,
In raven-black and venom's scowl,
In moonlit mirror and midnight prowler,
Hecate Brimo, the mighty vengeful power.

O mother of perplexing obscurity,
Whose voice doth grumble in the molten forge,
Whose whisper churns the caldron which
Raises fire of knowledge, life, and beyond.

We come armed with scepters entwined,
Crossroads blessed by Hecate Trivia's line,
Striding steadfast through haunted lands,
Bound by blood and much-defied command.

To graves we delve with relic and bone,
Calling spirits frail and known,
Hecate's child, amid those past,
Transfer knowledge to those amassing thy craft.

O Goddess of witches, necromantic might,
Mistress of night, the paths be thine,
Of Earth, of sea, and sky above,
Thy cryptic realms we endlessly desire.

Reveal thy keys of fleeting art,
Unlock mysteries concealed by time's guard,
O Hecate, with serpents' gaze,
Whirl us in thy dance within cryptic haze.

In arcane verse and song enthralling,
With boundless devotion we draw thee near,
Enshroud us in thy darkness alluring,
O Hecate, for whom we are ever tending.
