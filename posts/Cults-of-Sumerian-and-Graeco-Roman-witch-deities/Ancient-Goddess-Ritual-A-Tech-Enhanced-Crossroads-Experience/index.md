  Title: The Illuminated Crossroads
  
  Objective: To honor the ancient deities Lilith, Hecate, and Trivia through a contemporary and immersive ritual that bridges the gap between the ancient mysteries and modern technology.
  
  Venue: An art gallery or museum space, where the walls are decorated with QR codes linking to images and texts pertaining to Lilith, Hecate, and Trivia. The center of the space features a large, interactive digital projection of a crossroads.
  
  Preparation:
  
  1. Setting up the interactive crossroads projection in the center of the venue, with each road leading towards a distinct altar dedicated to each goddess. The projection should change dynamically, showing lunar cycles and symbols as participants approach.
  
  2. Creating a custom mobile app for the event, incorporating AR (augmented reality) technology to reveal hidden elements, messages, and symbols related to the deities when viewed through the app's camera.
  
  3. Installing a sound system to play ceremonial music and chants throughout the space, accompanied by atmospheric, ambient compositions.
  
  Ceremony:
  
  1. Begin with a torch-bearing procession, where participants, guided by the app, navigate through the venue by following an AR-generated path along the projected crossroads. The torches symbolize the guiding light of the goddesses and the journey towards wisdom and enlightenment.
  
  2. The participants converge at the intersection of the crossroads and, through collaboration and guidance from the mobile app, perform a dance or movement piece invoking the goddesses' powers. This shared experience is recorded and live-streamed through social media platforms to remotely involve other worshipers.
  
  3. Participants then split into three groups, each visiting a different altar dedicated to one of the goddesses. Here, they can discover more about the deity and participate in individual rituals. 
  
  At each altar, they will find:
  
  a) Lilith's altar: Offerings of lapis lazuli, carnelian, and obsidian to enhance spiritual growth and independence. An interactive digital painting depicting Lilith in the night sky, where touching it reveals different aspects of her mythos.
  
  b) Hecate's altar: Offerings of traditional herbs such as mugwort, lavender, and myrrh, alongside moonstone and black tourmaline. A VR (virtual reality) experience where participants journey to a liminal space where Hecate bestows upon them guidance and wisdom.
  
  c) Trivia's altar: Offerings of juniper and datura flowers, as well as her sacred stones, schorl and jet. The altar showcases a holographic representation of Trivia at the crossroads, whispering enigmatic riddles and prophecies to all who listen.
  
  4. To complete the ceremony, participants gather back at the center of the crossroads and, led by a high priest or priestess, chant sacred hymns and invocations to Lilith, Hecate, and Trivia. Participants are encouraged to share their experiences and reflections on social media, connecting the ancient rite with modern communication.
  
  The Illuminated Crossroads is a unique combination of ancient and contemporary practices, immersing participants in the rich mythologies and energies of Lilith, Hecate, and Trivia. This transformative experience unites the past and present, honoring the timeless wisdom of these powerful witch-deities.
