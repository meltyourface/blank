1. Examining the Sumerian and Graeco-Roman mythological texts about Ishtar and Aphrodite's origins:

Ishtar is a crucial figure in the Sumerian and Mesopotamian pantheon, having origins that date back to at least 3500 BCE. Her name is derived from the Sumerian Inanna, and she later becomes Ishtar in the Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian periods. The most prominent texts detailing Ishtar's mythological origins include the Epic of Gilgamesh and Inanna's Descent into the Underworld.

Aphrodite is a well-known goddess within the Graeco-Roman pantheon, with her origins most commonly associated with Hesiod's Theogony, the Homeric Hymns, and Ovid's Metamorphoses. There are two contradictory origin stories for Aphrodite: one tells of her birth from the sea foam produced by Uranus' severed genitals, while the other claims her to be the daughter of Zeus and Dione.

These differing accounts may have arisen from attempts to synthesize Ishtar's firmly established mythos with existing Mediterranean beliefs and local cults, which may have distorted the original stories over time.

2. Analyzing the role of each goddess in their respective pantheons:

Ishtar holds a dual role in the Mesopotamian pantheon, embodying the traits of both a fertility and a war goddess. Scholars have noted that she may represent the paradox of life and death, emphasizing her importance to ancient societies that often found themselves in the cyclical throes of plentiful harvests and violent conflict.

Aphrodite, similarly, is the goddess of love and beauty in Graeco-Roman mythology. While her main domain is not warfare, she holds dominion over romantic and sexual love, which could lead to passionate and destructive emotions comparable to war. These shared attributes may point to a transition—or amalgamation—of Ishtar's roles into Aphrodite over time.

3. Investigating the rituals and practices within the cults dedicated to Aphrodite and Ishtar:

The cult practices surrounding Ishtar focused on fertility rites, sacred prostitution, and the worship of the divine feminine. Temples to Ishtar were filled with sacred temple prostitutes, who engaged in sexual acts as a form of worship. Additionally, the cult emphasized the consumption of bread and beer as offerings to the goddess.

The cult of Aphrodite, similarly, featured sacred prostitution and elaborate, sensual rituals both within and outside her temples. Animal sacrifices such as doves or hares were also common in honor of the goddess, and rituals often involved the use of cosmetics and scented oils as offerings.

4. Studying the archaeological and artistic evidence:

The iconography of Ishtar often features symbols of fertility and warfare, such as the eight-pointed star, the lion, and the morning and evening stars (Venus). Conversely, Aphrodite's artistic depictions typically focus on her beauty, featuring elements like the dove, the apple, the rose, and shells.

Historical and archeological evidence of Aphrodite worship can be found in various temples throughout the Mediterranean, such as the sanctuaries in Paphos and Kythira. Inscriptions and statues often indicate a strong Hellenistic influence on Aphrodite's iconography, perhaps suggesting a melding of local traditions with the imported mythos of Ishtar.

5. Proposing a nuanced understanding of the relationship between Aphrodite and Ishtar:

While their origin stories and some symbolism differ, the numerous similarities in cult practices, roles within their respective pantheons, and themes of fertility and love suggest a strong connection between Ishtar and Aphrodite. The conflation or synthesis of these mythologies could have happened due to cultural exchanges, the spread of ideas and religious practices throughout the ancient world, or the assimilation of existing goddess figures into new forms more palatable to expanding empires. To account for the historical and cultural contexts that shaped these goddesses, it is vital to recognize the multi-faceted nature of their complex personas—embracing the shared and unique characteristics of both Ishtar and Aphrodite.
