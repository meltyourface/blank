To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, we first need to understand the key concepts that drive the question: ecological and political environment, magical traditions, and environmental sustainability, social awareness, and global harmony. With a comprehension of these terms, we will then explore how the study and integration of these aspects in magical work contribute positively to personal practice, ultimately leading to a more sustainable, harmonious world.

Ecological environment refers to the interrelationships between living organisms, their physical surroundings, and the natural processes that occur within their ecosystems. The political environment, on the other hand, encompasses formal and informal systems, institutions, and relationships that shape society's governance and decision-making.

Magical traditions are sets of beliefs, rituals, practices, and spiritual perspectives that have evolved over time, shaping the way people connect with the divine, the environment, and each other. Including traditions like Wicca, Druidry, and various Indigenous spiritual practices, these perspectives often emphasize the interdependence of all living beings and their habitats, urging practitioners to respect and revere these connections.

Environmental sustainability is the long-term maintenance of ecosystems, ensuring a balance between ecological, economic, and social factors. Social awareness reflects the understanding and responsiveness to social issues, needs, and diversity. Lastly, global harmony refers to the collaboration and synergies that foster peace, stability, and cooperation across different cultures, communities, and nations.

With these definitions in mind, we can investigate how understanding the ecological and political environment within various magical traditions enriches and effectively influences personal magical work.

1. **Enhancing spiritual connection**: By examining the ecological philosophy of various magical traditions, we can develop a deeper understanding of our connection to the earth and its ecosystems. This heightened recognition of our reliance on nature fosters a more profound spiritual bond, empowering our magical work and instilling a sense of stewardship towards our environment.

2. **Building awareness of socio-political aspects**: Studying the historical and cultural contexts of magical traditions allows us to better comprehend the political dimensions inherent within these practices. This knowledge equips us with a more thorough understanding of how our actions, beliefs, and rituals can either sustain social and environmental issues or contribute positively to change.

3. **Encouraging sustainable practices**: Recognizing the ecological wisdom in various magical traditions inspires us to incorporate more sustainable practices into our personal work. For instance, using ethically-sourced materials and engaging in land-based rituals that minimize environmental harm reflects a commitment to both magical practices and ecological sustainability.

4. **Promoting cultural exchange and understanding**: Through the exploration of diverse magical traditions, we gain insights into how different cultures express and understand their relationships with the environment and the divine. By adopting an open and respectful attitude towards these various beliefs, we foster global harmony and cooperation. 

5. **Supporting social justice and political activism**: By acknowledging the socio-political aspects of magical traditions, practitioners become more engaged with social and environmental issues. This awareness often leads to actions that support social justice, promote equality, and advocate for environmental conservation.

To summarize, understanding the ecological and political environments in various magical traditions enriches one's personal magical work by:

1. Enhancing spiritual connection to the earth and its ecosystems.
2. Building awareness of socio-political aspects embedded within magical practices.
3. Encouraging sustainable, environmentally-conscious rituals and behaviors.
4. Promoting cultural exchange, understanding, and global harmony.
5. Supporting social justice, political activism, and conservation efforts.

Through exploration, study, and engaging with various magical traditions, individuals can more effectively combine environmental sustainability, social awareness, and global harmony into their own magical practice. In doing so, they contribute to a more just, sustainable, and harmonious world for all.
