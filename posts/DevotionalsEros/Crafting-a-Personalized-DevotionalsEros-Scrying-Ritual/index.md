1. Setup and Preparation:

Select a quiet and dimly lit space where you can be free from any distractions. Choose a comfortable seating arrangement, preferably a cushioned chair, as it's important to be at ease while scrying. Ensure that the area is cleansed of negative energies by smudging with sage or palo santo, as this encourages a positive atmosphere for DevotionalsEros scrying.

2. Crystal Ball or Black Obsidian Mirror:

Choose your preferred scrying tool, either a crystal ball or a black obsidian mirror. Both can serve as effective conduits for tapping into romantic and erotic experiences. Cleanse the chosen tool with saltwater and moonlight, and then charge it with your sexual desires by holding it between your hands while focusing your intentions.

3. Incense, Sigils, and Ambient Music:

Select an incense that corresponds to your intention, such as rose for romantic love, musk for sensuality, or ylang-ylang for passion. Light the incense and allow its scent to permeate the room. Choose or create a personalized sigil that embodies your erotic or romantic desires. Draw the sigil on a piece of parchment and place it near your scrying tool.

Design or select a playlist of ambient music that complements the theme of DevotionalsEros. Ideally, the music should be instrumental and soothing, with a sensual undertone to foster an atmospheres conducive to exploring erotic energies.

4. Craft a Personalized Ritual:

Crafting a personalized DevotionalsEros scrying ritual involves a few essential components:

a. Begin with a grounding and centering meditation to align your energy and focus your intention.
b. Invoke the energies of love, passion, and eroticism to assist you in your scrying. Call upon deities, guides, or your higher self as you deem fit.
c. State your intention, whether you're seeking to explore personal desires, connect with a partner's energy, or simply deepen your understanding of your own sensuality.

5. Step-by-Step Scrying Example:

a. Sit comfortably in your chosen space, with your incense burning, music playing, and sigil placed nearby.
b. Hold your crystal ball or black obsidian mirror in your hands, or set it on a stand in front of you.
c. Close your eyes, take slow deep breaths, and visualize your chosen sigil while focusing on your erotic or romantic desires.
d. Open your eyes and gaze gently into your scrying tool, allowing your peripheral vision to come into play. Soften your gaze and allow the images, colors, or sensations to come to you naturally.
e. Remain patient and stay receptive to any messages or experiences that arise within the scrying tool. Allow these visions to deepen your understanding of self, your partner, or your desires.

6. Processing the Scrying Experience:

Once you feel that you've received sufficient information, close your scrying session with gratitude. Thank the energies that assisted you and release them back to their realms. Take time to process the information and experiences encountered, journaling any insights that may be relevant to your understanding of your sensual and erotic energies. Remember that the key to successful scrying in the realm of DevotionalsEros is maintaining a sense of openness and curiosity, allowing space for your personal and shared energies to unfold and blossom in unforeseen ways.
