Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this sacred gathering under the loving watch of the God and Goddess, the eternal forces of life, love, and creation. We have convened in the presence of the four elements – Earth, Air, Fire, and Water – to witness the spiritual union of [Partner 1] and [Partner 2] as they embark on the path of lifelong partnership and devotion in a handfasting ceremony. 

(Priest/Priestess cleanses the ceremonial space and casts the circle)

I, as the appointed Priest/Priestess, standing firmly between the realms, call upon the four elements and the God and Goddess to assist and bless the loving journey of [Partner 1] and [Partner 2]. Let their union be guided by the forces of these powerful energies and divine presence throughout their lives.

Air, element of the East, inspire their minds with wisdom, granting clarity and understanding. May your gentle winds carry their love to the farthest corners of the world.
(Priest/Priestess anoints the couple with oil, imbued with herbs and spices symbolizing the element of Air)

Fire, element of the South, ignite their passion for each other and the world, fueling creativity and strength within them. May your flames keep their love burning brightly and eternally.
(Priest/Priestess lights a red or orange candle, symbolizing the element of Fire, as the couple joins their hands together)

Water, element of the West, flow freely and deeply into their love, nurturing and healing them, allowing them to grow together for years to come. May your soothing waves comfort them in their union.
(Priest/Priestess sprinkles sacred water over the couple, symbolizing the element of Water)

Earth, element of the North, provide a steadfast foundation for their love, grounded in trust, abundance, and harmony. May your fertile soil be a refuge for them in times of need.
(Priest/Priestess presents the couple with a bowl of seeds or salt, symbolizing the element of Earth)

Now that the elemental energies are present and activated within your sacred union, [Partner 1] and [Partner 2], please state your personally crafted vows to each other.

(Partner 1 and Partner 2 share their vows)

To seal these vows, let the sacred cord bind you both symbolically and spiritually. As I wrap your joined hands with this cord, let the colors speak of the energies you wish to imbue in your hearts and lives together. Remember this commitment to nurture your love, today and always.

(Priest/Priestess wraps the sacred cord around the couple's hands)

By the divine grace of the God and Goddess, and the elemental forces of nature, I hereby declare your hands fasted, and your souls' bonded in eternal love.

Blessed be!

(All in the circle say, "Blessed be!")

Now, let us close the circle and transition to a celebratory feast, rejoicing in the spiritual union of [Partner 1] and [Partner 2], honoring these elemental energies and the divine. Let us share our joy in a feast of nourishment, delight, and kinship.

(Priest/Priestess closes the circle and invites all gathered to join in a celebration feast, consisting of food and drink infused with the four elements' energies, with an offering made to each element and the God and Goddess)
