  Act I: Invocation to Summon the Ancestral Witches
  
  Setting: Within a secluded clearing surrounded by ancient trees, an altar is prepared, adorned with candles, a chalice filled with mead, a bundle of sage, and a cauldron containing ashes from past rituals. The area is illuminated by the full moon's cold light.
  
  1. Begin the invocation by lighting the candles in a circle around the altar, paying homage to the elements, as well as the cardinal directions.
  2. Light the sage bundle and use it to cleanse the ritual space, while chanting:
  
  "By sage and smoke, we call upon the old,
  Ancestral witches, wise and bold,
  In this sacred circle, come and dance,
  Guides of craft, we seek your stance."
  
  3. Focus on the cauldron and toss a handful of rosemary, mugwort, and wormwood into the ashes, igniting them to create a smoldering mixture. As the ritual participants gather around the cauldron, chant:
  
  "Hearth of old, spirits arise,
  Ash and smoke, spirits wise,
  Heed our call and cross the veil,
  In this witches' dance, we hail."
  
  Act II: The Witches Dance
  
  1. The ritual participants, adorned in dark, flowing fabrics with symbols of their lineage, form a circle around the cauldron while holding hands.
  2. Begin the dance with slow, sweeping movements, matching the rhythm of a drum played by one of the participants. As the tempo increases, introduce spinning, jumping, and intricate footwork patterns. This dance serves as a bridge between worlds, manifesting the ancestral witches' power within the physical realm. 
  3. The dancers chant as they move, connecting to their heritage:
  
  "Spirals, leaps, and steps of old,
  Ancient stories now retold,
  Through our dance, your power flows,
  Ancestral witches, we uphold."
  
  Act III: Ritual Offering
  
  1. Bring the dance to a close and indicate gratitude by placing the hands over the heart. Then, approach the altar, where the chalice of mead awaits.
  2. Each participant takes a turn offering mead to the ancestral spirits, saying:
  
  "To our ancestors, we now share,
  This drink of honor; a token, rare,
  May your wisdom bless our path,
  As we continue the witches' craft."
  
  3. After the offering, thank the ancestral spirits for joining the rite:
  
  "Ancestors, we honor your grace,
  Wisdom from times long since passed,
  With blessings shared, we bid farewell,
  Till next we gather, for tales to tell."
  
  4. Close the ceremony by snuffing out the candles and dispersing the ashes of the ritual fire, symbolizing the return of the spirits to their realm. The connection to the ancestral witches has been strengthened through the invocation, dance, and offering, creating a lasting impact on the present and future generations of practitioners.
