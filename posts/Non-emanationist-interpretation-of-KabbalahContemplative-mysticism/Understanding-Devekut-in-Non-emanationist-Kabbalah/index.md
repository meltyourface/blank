To fully understand the question, let us first break down its main components: Non-emanationist interpretation of Kabbalah, contemplative mysticism, devekut (cleaving), and Ten Sefirot.

Non-emanationist interpretation of Kabbalah: This interpretation of Kabbalah moves away from the traditional view of emanationism which posits that the physical world is a direct outcome of a series of emanations or outflow of Divine energy from God. Instead, non-emanationist Kabbalah considers that our reality exists independently from the Divine and sees our connection with the divine as one achieved through intellectual, emotional, and mystical means.

**Contemplative mysticism**: This is a spiritual practice that seeks Divine experiences and deeper understanding of reality through contemplation, introspection, and meditation.

Devekut (cleaving): Devekut is a Hebrew term for a mystical state in which an individual feels united or attached to the Divine.

**Ten Sefirot**: The Sefirot are ten attributes, emanations, or channels according to traditional Kabbalah, in which the infinite divine energy manifests and interacts with the created world. They represent a framework for understanding different aspects of God and reality.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the components of the question, let's delve into the analysis of devekut in the context of the Non-emanationist interpretation of Kabbalah and its relationship with the Ten Sefirot. 

In the Non-emanationist interpretation of Kabbalah, the Ten Sefirot are not viewed as direct outflows of divine energy, but rather as conceptual guiding principles that help initiates in understanding different aspects of the Divine and reality. Devekut, in this context, is achieved through conscious alignment of oneself with these guiding principles and transcending one's limited ego identity to experience a state of union with the Divine.

The process begins by developing a deep understanding of each of the Ten Sefirot:

1. Keter (Crown) represents the highest and most transcendent aspect of God, the pure consciousness, and the source of all other Sefirot.

2. Chokhmah (Wisdom) represents the divine wisdom, the ability to perceive the unified nature of reality.

3. Binah (Understanding) represents the intellectual aspect, the ability to analyze and differentiate the aspects of Divine creation.

4. Chesed (Mercy) signifies kindness, love, and compassion towards oneself and others.

5. Gevurah (Strength) refers to the ability to impose limits and boundaries, representing discipline and judgment.

6. Tiferet (Beauty) is the harmonious balance of Chesed and Gevurah, representing harmony and compassion.

7. Netzach (Eternity) signifies persistence, endurance, and the ability to overcome obstacles.

8. Hod (Splendor) represents humility, surrender, and the willingness to learn and receive.

9. Yesod (Foundation) is associated with creativity and the connection between the spiritual and the material realms.

10. Malkhut (Kingdom) refers to the physical world, the perception of God's presence in our reality, and the final realization of unity with the Divine.

The initiate, through contemplative mysticism, embarks on a journey of attuning their intellect, emotions, and spiritual faculties with these aspects of the Sefirot. By doing so, they develop a more profound connection with the Divine without relying on the concept of emanation.

For example, an initiate may engage in meditation practices to cultivate a sense of Chesed (compassion), or study sacred texts to enhance their understanding of Chokhmah (Wisdom). Regardless of the method, the ultimate goal is to refine one's consciousness to align with the essence of each Sefirah, facilitating devekut and a connection with the Divine.

In summary, the Non-emanationist interpretation of KabbalahContemplative mysticism proposes that devekut is achieved through a deeply personal and transformative process involving intellectual, emotional, and spiritual engagement with the Ten Sefirot. As initiates engage with these aspects of the Divine, they experience a transcendent state of unity without relying on the concept of emanation.
