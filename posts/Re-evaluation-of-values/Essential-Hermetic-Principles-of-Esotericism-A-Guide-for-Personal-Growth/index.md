To analyze the influences of the Kybalion's Hermetic Principles on modern Western esotericism and their potential impacts on an individual's re-evaluation of values, we first need to gain a thorough understanding of these principles. The Kybalion, a foundational text in modern Western esotericism, elucidates seven essential Hermetic Principles which are derived from the teachings of the ancient Egyptian sage, Hermes Trismegistus. These principles serve as a philosophical touchstone for those wishing to explore and understand the nature of reality. The seven Hermetic Principles include the concepts of mentalism, correspondence, vibration, polarity, rhythm, cause and effect, and gender.

1. Principle of Mentalism: The principle of mentalism posits that “The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental.” It underscores the idea that every object and event in the universe is a mental creation; everything exists within the mind. Understanding this principle leads an individual on the path of self-discovery and the comprehension of their own mental power.

2. Principle of Correspondence: “As above, so below; as below, so above.” This principle emphasizes the harmony and interconnection between the various planes of existence - spiritual, psychological, and physical. By grasping this concept, we can begin to recognize patterns and connections within our own lives and the broader universe, thereby empowering our decision-making processes.

3. Principle of Vibration: Everything in the universe, both seen and unseen, is in constant motion and resonates at a specific frequency - “Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.” By comprehending the significance of vibrations, we can tune in to the energies of our surroundings and better understand how to manifest desired changes in our lives.

4. Principle of Polarity: “Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites.” The principle of polarity emphasizes the existence of opposing forces within the universe that are complementary and interconnected, like light and dark or love and hatred. Recognizing this duality enhances our ability to harmonize our own energies and engage with the dualistic nature of reality.

5. Principle of Rhythm: “Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides.” The principle of rhythm highlights the cyclical nature of the universe and the fact that energy moves in ebbs and flows. Understanding this principle enables us to better predict and adapt to the natural cycles of growth and decline in our lives.

6. Principle of Cause and Effect: “Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause.” This principle points out that nothing happens by chance, and there is a reason behind each occurrence. By understanding this concept, we can take responsibility for our actions and consciously shape our experiences.

7. Principle of Gender: “Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles.” The principle of gender underscores the complementary and interdependent aspects of masculine and feminine energies within people and the universe. Acknowledging this principle helps us to balance our inner energies and appreciate the importance of nurturing both aspects of our nature.

The potential impact of these Hermetic Principles on an individual's re-evaluation of values is profound. By internalizing these principles and considering them in a holistic manner, an individual can reassess their personal value systems, fostering inner growth and a more profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all aspects of life. Furthermore, modern Western esotericism has been shaped by these principles, as evidenced by the influence of Hermeticism on disciplines such as alchemy, astrology, and tarot.

In summary, the Kybalion's Hermetic Principles serve as a foundation for modern Western esoteric thought and practice, profoundly influencing our understanding of the universe and our place within it. By engaging with and internalizing these principles, we can reevaluate and enhance our personal values, promoting growth, balance, and a deeper appreciation of the interconnected nature of reality. These principles also support the development of essential life skills, such as personal responsibility, adaptability, and the ability to perceive patterns and connections within the world around us. Overall, the Kybalion's Hermetic Principles offer us a framework for personal and collective evolution.
