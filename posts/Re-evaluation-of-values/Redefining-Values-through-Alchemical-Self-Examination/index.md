The challenge presented is to explore the application of the alchemical principle "Solve et Coagula" in the context of personal values and self-discovery.

Before diving into the response, let's start by defining "Solve et Coagula". It is a Latin phrase that can be translated as "dissolve and coagulate". This principle has its roots in the Western esoteric and occult tradition, specifically within the practice of alchemy. Alchemists believed that by breaking down and purifying substances, they could transmute base metals, such as lead, into more noble and valuable metals, like gold. Symbolically, this process represents the transformation of the practitioner's own being, transcending the limitations of ordinary human consciousness and unlocking hidden potentials.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the concept, let us explore how "Solve et Coagula" can be applied to the re-evaluation of one's personal values and the pursuit of wisdom and self-discovery.

In this context, the alchemical processes can be understood in a metaphorical way:

1. Solve (Dissolve): This process involves breaking down one's preexisting values, beliefs, and assumptions. This can be achieved through honest self-reflection, critical examination, and open-minded inquiry. By identifying the root of our values, we can better understand their origins and influences on our lives (such as cultural, societal, or familial factors). In doing so, we can also expose any outdated, contradictory, or harmful beliefs that may be holding us back.

2. Coagula (Coagulate): Once this introspective deconstruction is complete, the next step is to "rebuild" and refine our values. This can be done by actively seeking out new perspectives, experiences, and insights that resonate with our authentic selves. By integrating this newfound wisdom into our personal belief system, we can develop a more holistic, evolved, and spiritually-nourished sense of self.

To further illustrate these points, let us consider an example. Imagine a person who has grown up in a conservative environment where conformity to societal norms is highly valued. This person may have internalized the belief that following the crowd is the "right" way to live. Through the process of Solve et Coagula, they may begin to question and break down this belief, examining its roots in their upbringing and the limitations it imposes on their personal growth. Upon doing so, they might discover a passion for creative self-expression that was suppressed due to their learned conformity. This revelation could lead to the re-evaluation and subsequent transformation of their values to prioritize individuality and authenticity.

In conclusion, the alchemical principle of "Solve et Coagula" can be applied to the re-evaluation of one's personal values to facilitate greater wisdom and self-discovery. By dissolving and breaking down old belief systems, we can expose the underlying factors that influence our thoughts and actions. With this newfound understanding, we can then coagulate and rebuild our values by incorporating enlightening insights and experiences that lead to personal growth and spiritual refinement.

Key themes and ideas in this response include: 
- The historical and esoteric context of "Solve et Coagula" as rooted in alchemy.
- An interpretation of the phrase in the context of personal values and self-discovery.
- Steps for applying the alchemical process metaphorically through self-reflection and personal growth. 
- The essential conclusion of using "Solve et Coagula" as a framework to achieve profound wisdom and a refined sense of self.
