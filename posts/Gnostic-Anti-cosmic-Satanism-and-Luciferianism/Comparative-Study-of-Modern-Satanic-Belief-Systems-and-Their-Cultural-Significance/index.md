Modern Satanism, LaVeyan Satanism, Gnostic Anti-cosmic Satanism, and Luciferianism each comprise distinct belief systems and practices, despite their shared exploration of the dark and often misunderstood aspects of spirituality. A thorough examination of the distinct doctrines, rituals, and philosophies of these systems as well as their historical development and contemporary cultural relevance illuminates the intricate nuances that set each apart and underscores their vital intersections.

1. Modern Satanism: Emerging primarily as a countercultural response to orthodox religious views, Modern Satanism promotes free thought, individualism, and personal responsibility. It repudiates the notion of an external deity and instead emphasizes the power and agency within each person. Modern Satanists may incorporate elements from various magical and religious practices as expressions of self-discovery and empowerment. As a whole, Modern Satanism is less focused on dogma and more on personal exploration.

2. LaVeyan Satanism: Founded by Anton LaVey in 1966, with the establishment of the Church of Satan and the publication of The Satanic Bible, LaVeyan Satanism offers a materialistic, atheistic philosophy celebrating the self, indulgence, and pragmatism. LaVey drew upon various philosophical and occult sources, including Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, and Aleister Crowley, and codified a set of Satanic tenets. Rituals within LaVeyan Satanism, such as the "Infernal Benediction," are intended primarily as psychodramatic expressions of the individual's will and desires.

3. Gnostic Anti-cosmic Satanism: Rooted in Gnosticism, Anti-cosmic Satanism ascribes to the belief that the material world and the creator deity— the Demiurge — are inherently flawed and evil. The true essence of humanity resides in the Divine Spark of the Pleroma, or the transcendent spiritual realm. Gnostic Anti-cosmic Satanism regards Satan as a liberating force or symbol aiding in the transcendence beyond the limitations of the material world. Rituals within this path frequently focus on mystical experiences aimed at unearthing the individual's divine potential and reconnecting with the Pleroma.

4. Luciferianism: While Luciferianism shares some commonalities with Satanism, it emphasizes the figure of Lucifer as a bringer of light, knowledge, and personal transformation. Luciferians view human potential as a continuous process of self-improvement and self-actualization, with spiritual practices spanning both white and black magic. Two major figures in this tradition include Michael W. Ford, author of The Book of the Witch Moon, and Peter Grey, the brains behind Apocalyptic Witchcraft.

Each of these belief systems borrows aspects from earlier esoteric traditions. For example, Gnostic Anti-cosmic Satanism and Luciferianism can both trace their roots to ancient Gnosticism, while LaVeyan Satanism and Modern Satanism draw from the works of Aleister Crowley and ceremonial magic. Despite their unique characteristics, they all share a sense of otherness and resistance to traditional religious structures.

Today, the continued appeal and growth of these ideologies can be attributed to several factors, such as the increasing prominence of secularism, a growing distrust of institutional authority and dogma, and a desire to explore alternative paths for personal growth and self-empowerment. The internet has also provided fertile ground for the dissemination and discussion of these belief systems, offering a platform for those attracted to the mysteries and challenges of exploring the lesser-known esoteric world.
