## The Ceremony of Divine Wrath and Malevolent Blessings

Introductory Notes:

The Ceremony of Divine Wrath and Malevolent Blessings is an intricate consecration rooted in the principles of Christian malediction. This rite serves to invoke the wrath of the divine upon enemies of the faith, while bestowing malevolent blessings upon its practitioners. The ceremony incorporates the use of three historic relics, sacred geometry, mystic symbolism, and a series of invocations and prayers. This ritual is designed for advanced practitioners and is not intended for novices or the faint of heart.
**Step 1**: Prepare the Ritual Space
First, choose a private and quiet location to perform the ritual. This location should be consecrated and purged of all negative energies prior to the ceremony. Set up a cruciform table, at its center place the sacred relics. Prepare candles, incense (frankincense and myrrh), holy water, and a silver chalice containing sacramental wine.
**Step 2**: Draw the Sacred Geometry
Around the cruciform table, use chalk to draw a heptagram (signifying the seven deadly sins and their corresponding virtues). This will keep the energies contained within the ritual and safeguard from any possible backlash. Inscribe seven mystic symbols representing the opposing theological forces (e.g., angels and demons) at each point of the heptagram.
**Step 3**: The Opening Invocation
Begin the ritual by lighting the candles and incense in a counter-clockwise manner, representing the unraveling of divine protection upon those targeted by the malediction. Recite the opening invocation:

"In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to guide our hands in this consecrated rite. May the wrath of the Divine and the malevolent blessings befall those who transgress against the Holy Word. In Thy mercy, grant us the power to execute this ceremony with accuracy and reverence."
**Step 4**: Presentation of Holy Relics

1. The Holy Lance (Spear of Destiny): This is the spear that pierced the side of Jesus Christ during his crucifixion. It's believed to be imbued with great power and can grant its possessor immense influence. 
2. Judas' Thirty Pieces of Silver: These are the coins paid to Judas for his betrayal of Jesus. They symbolize the duality of guilt and penance, which can amplify a malediction's potency. 
3. The Crown of Thorns: The very crown of thorns that was placed on Jesus' head during his crucifixion. It represents the burden of suffering and can invoke the divine wrath upon the enemies of the faith.
**Step 5**: Consecration of the Relics
Sprinkle the holy water upon the relics while reciting:

"By the blood of the Lamb, we consecrate these relics for our purpose. In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we call upon their power to aid us in invoking divine wrath and malevolent blessings."
**Step 6**: The Central Prayer
Kneel and recite the central prayer, specifically naming the targets of the malediction:

"Omnipotent Deus, we implore Thee to strike down those who transgress against Thy Divine Will (mention the names). Let the wrath of Heaven rain upon them, and may they know the weight of malevolent blessings. Through the power of these sacred relics, we call upon Thee to manifest Thy justice, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."
**Step 7**: Imbibing the Sacramental Wine
Drink from the chalice, symbolizing the receptive vessel for malevolent blessings, and meditate upon the malediction's targets. Visualize divine wrath descending upon them, and feel the weight of the relicsâ€™ power within you.
**Step 8**: Closing the Ritual
Recite the closing prayer:

"By Thy grace, O Lord, we have enacted this ritual to serve Thy higher purpose. Grant that the works of our hands bring about righteous justice and malevolent blessings within the domain of Thy authority. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, we humbly close this rite. Amen."

Extinguish the candles and incense in a clockwise manner, representing the restored divine protection. Thank all participants and guardians of the sacred space for their presence and acknowledgement of the completed ceremony.

Remember that this ritual is a powerful tool and must only be used with proper discernment and caution.
