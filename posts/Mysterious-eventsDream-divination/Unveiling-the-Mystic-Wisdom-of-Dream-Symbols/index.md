To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first identify three nocturnal dream elements, delve into their esoteric interpretations, establish connections to specific instances of unexplained phenomena, and ultimately reveal an overarching occult guidance for the dreamer.

Element 1: The Serpent
Symbolically, the serpent represents wisdom, transformation, and the life force. In many esoteric traditions, it is associated with Kundalini energy, which travels up the spine and activates the chakras, awakening spiritual awareness and psychic abilities.

**Unexplained Phenomenon Connection**: The appearance of mysterious serpent-like creatures throughout history, such as the Loch Ness Monster, could be interpreted as manifestations of elemental forces or energies, symbolizing deep, transformative spiritual experiences.

**Overarching Occult Guidance**: When a serpent appears in dreams, the dreamer should consider the possibility of an impending spiritual transformation or growth in their psychic abilities. They may be called to explore practices that awaken their Kundalini energy, seek wisdom, or embrace life changes.

Element 2: The Full Moon
The Full Moon is often associated with heightened intuition, psychic energy, and the completion of cycles. It serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life and the interconnection of all things.

**Unexplained Phenomenon Connection**: The Full Moon has long been linked to instances of unexplained phenomena, including increases in paranormal activity and human behavior anomalies, such as lunacy, which is derived from "luna" or "moon." 

**Overarching Occult Guidance**: The appearance of a Full Moon in a dream may signal the closing of one phase of life and the beginning of another. The dreamer should pay attention to their intuition, as it may be heightened during this time, and be open to guidance from the "unseen" realms.

Element 3: The Shadowy Figure
The shadowy figure often symbolizes the unknown, the unconscious mind, and the hidden aspects of one's self. Jungian psychology regards the shadow as the embodiment of traits the conscious self does not recognize.

**Unexplained Phenomenon Connection**: Shadowy figures are often reported during unexplained phenomena like sleep paralysis, where individuals awaken to a sense of being watched or approached by an ominous figure. This experience may represent suppressed fears, unacknowledged emotions, or an invitation to explore the inner depths of one's psyche.

**Overarching Occult Guidance**: The appearance of a shadowy figure in a dream invites the dreamer to confront their fears, embrace their inner shadow, and integrate hidden aspects of the self. This process ultimately leads to self-acceptance, self-awareness, and growth.

In conclusion, these three dream elements - the serpent, the Full Moon, and the shadowy figure - offer the dreamer occult guidance by pointing to spiritual transformation, intuition, and self-integration. By embracing the wisdom of these symbols and applying their lessons to daily life, the dreamer can achieve greater self-awareness and spiritual growth. The connections to unexplained phenomena demonstrate that these symbols have deep roots in human experience, transcending cultural and temporal boundaries.
