To complete the task, I begin by analyzing the individual's birth chart and delving into their astrological influences with the help of my mastery of the Other Side. The reported birth information is as follows:

Individual: John Doe
Date of Birth: March 3, 1990
Time of Birth: 12:15 PM local time
Place of Birth: London, United Kingdom

To commence the comprehensive analysis, I first explore the pivotal planetary alignments, transits, and aspects associated with their supernatural potential.

1. Sun in Pisces in the 10th house: This suggests a strong connection to the spiritual realm and psychic sensitivity developed through professional or public roles. The individual may be drawn to matters of the Other Side naturally, as they serve as a channel for their intuitive abilities.

2. Moon in Scorpio in the 5th house: This placement indicates an intense emotional nature with a desire to explore the depths of the human psyche. Coupled with their creativity, their otherworldly encounters could manifest through various artistic expressions or by tapping into the collective unconscious.

3. Mercury in Aquarius in the 9th house: The individual could have an open and progressive mind, which points to a likelihood of learning and understanding secrets of the metaphysical world. This placement also indicates a unique and innovative approach to occult knowledge, attracting breakthroughs in esoteric philosophies or practices.

4. Mars conjunct Pluto in Scorpio in the 5th house: This powerful conjunction signifies a deep reservoir of energy that can be channeled towards transformative and occult experiences. The individual may develop a profound understanding of life's mysteries, including astral projection, energy healing, or sorcery.

5. Venus in Capricorn in the 7th house: This placement suggests a strong affinity towards forming alliances and partnerships in the pursuit of their otherworldly interests. The individual is likely to attract mentors and collaborators who can provide guidance and support in exploring the hidden dimensions of existence.

Analyzing their connections to demonic, angelic, or ancient elemental forces:

1. The presence of a strong Pisces influence, especially with the Sun in the 10th house, could indicate a direct line of communication with Higher Beings and angelic entities. The individual may receive divine guidance through dreams or visions.

2. The Scorpio Moon and Mars-Pluto conjunction signify a deep bond with the shadow aspects of life, providing a possible link to darker, chthonic energies. They may be compelled to explore and balance these forces within themselves, acting as a conduit for transformation and renewal.

3. The various elemental aspects of their chart, including Earth (Venus in Capricorn) and Water (Sun in Pisces, Moon and Mars in Scorpio), suggest an innate capacity to harness the primal powers of nature. These energies could be utilized for spiritual growth, healing, or the development of psychic abilities.

Concluding with a detailed report on their otherworldly growth, karmic debt, and potential future involvement in esoteric or occult practices:

John Doe possesses remarkable potential for otherworldly growth, as evidenced by his unique astrological makeup. As he works to balance his inherent spiritual and shadow aspects, he can serve as a catalyst for his own evolution and the transformation of those around him.

His karmic debt may stem from previous lifetimes where power and knowledge were misused or exploited. Consequently, he must learn the significance of wielding his psychic and occult powers responsibly and ethically to preserve the balance between the seen and unseen worlds.

In the future, John is likely to play a crucial role in esoteric or occult practices. His innovative Mercury in Aquarius and psychic Pisces Sun suggest a destiny guided by both intuition and intellect. By embracing his extraordinary gifts and cultivating strong alliances, he can contribute to the expansion of metaphysical understanding and help usher in a new era of spiritual awakening.
