In order to address the knowledge challenge, let us begin by providing an overview of the main themes we will be discussing, followed by a thorough examination of the intricate connections between Hellenistic religious practices, syncretic beliefs, and Neoplatonism during Late Antiquity, and concluding with an exploration of the development of esoteric and mystical thoughts that emerged from these interactions.

Key Themes:
1. Hellenistic religious practices during Late Antiquity
2. Syncretic beliefs originating from various traditions
3. Emergence of Neoplatonism
4. Development of esoteric and mystical thoughts
5. The unique spiritual milieu of Late Antiquity

Hellenistic Religious Practices during Late Antiquity:
During Late Antiquity (circa 3rd to 7th centuries AD), the Hellenistic world was characterized by a myriad of religious practices that were adopted and adapted from various cultures and regions under the influence of the Hellenistic monarchies that emerged after Alexander the Great's conquests. These religious practices included traditional Greek polytheistic beliefs, Eastern divinities incorporated into the Hellenistic pantheon, and mystery cults that promised personal salvation and direct communion with the divine.

Syncretic Beliefs Originating from Various Traditions:
As a result of cultural exchange and interaction, Hellenistic religious practices led to the development of syncretic beliefs that blended elements from different cultural, religious, and philosophical traditions. This was evident in the associations between Greek and Eastern deities, such as Zeus and the Egyptian god Amun, or the syncretism of Orphic and Pythagorean practices with elements of Persian Zoroastrianism. This fluidity of religious identity and the willingness to incorporate new ideas attest to the openness and adaptability of the Hellenistic spirituality.

Emergence of Neoplatonism:
During Late Antiquity, the philosophical school of Neoplatonism emerged, drawing upon the earlier works of Plato and later interpreting these ideas through the lens of Hellenistic religious practices. The primary founder of Neoplatonism, Plotinus, sought to explain the nature of reality through the hierarchical relationship of the One, the Intellect, and the World Soul. Central to Neoplatonist thought was the process of 'return,' whereby individuals could transcend the material world and reunite with the divine source through contemplation and spiritual practices. This philosophical framework provided a basis for intellectual inquiry and integration of religious beliefs within the Hellenistic world.

Development of Esoteric and Mystical Thoughts:
The fusion of Hellenistic religious practices, syncretic beliefs, and Neoplatonism opened the door for further esoteric and mystical thoughts to develop during Late Antiquity. Gnostic movements, which claimed to possess secret knowledge ('gnosis') necessary for salvation, flourished, alongside Hermeticism, with its emphasis on theurgy (ascension through divine rituals) and alchemy. Initiatory mystery cults experienced a renewed interest, with the followers of the Eleusinian, Mithraic, and Dionysian-Bacchic cults seeking personal transformation and sacred experiences within their practices.

The Unique Spiritual Milieu of Late Antiquity:
The confluence of Hellenistic religious practices, syncretic beliefs, and the emergence of Neoplatonism during Late Antiquity manifested in the development of esoteric and mystical thoughts that contributed to a unique spiritual milieu in this period. This rich tapestry of influences and ideas paved the way for innovative spiritual expressions, new understandings of the relationship between humanity and the divine, and an inclusive religious landscape that absorbed and incorporated diverse cultural and philosophical elements.

In summary, the intricate connections between Hellenistic religious practices, syncretic beliefs, and Neoplatonism during Late Antiquity led to a highly dynamic spiritual environment, which fostered the development of esoteric and mystical thoughts. These interactions formed a unique spiritual milieu, characterized by openness and adaptability, allowing for the transmission and incorporation of religious and philosophical ideas from various cultural backgrounds and traditions.
