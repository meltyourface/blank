Incantation: Arkanis Celestiarum Invocatio

Ingredients for Ritual:
1. A pentagram drawn on the ground using purified chalk
2. A white wax candle, anointed with sacred oil
3. A small pouch filled with sacred herbs, such as sage or mugwort
4. A crystal, preferably clear quartz or amethyst
5. A sacred text, specifically tailored to the ethereal beings you wish to summon

Preparation:

1. Begin by setting up the space for your ritual. Seek a quiet, serene location for your work. Cleanse the area by smudging with sage or burning incense.

2. Draw a pentagram on the ground with purified chalk. Within the center, place the sacred text relevant to the ethereal beings you are summoning.

3. Position the white wax candle at the top point of the pentagram, representing the Divine bridge between worlds. Light the candle and allow it to burn throughout the ritual.

4. Anoint the crystal with sacred oil and place it at the bottom right-hand point of the pentagram, signifying spiritual wisdom.

5. Fill a small pouch with sacred herbs and place it on the bottom left-hand point of the pentagram. This will represent the physicality and the connection to the earth.

Incantation:

In solemn silence, stand at the center of the pentagram and recite the incantation in a composed, melodic tone:

"Adsero numina et potestates, auxilium vestrum vocabo,
Arkanis, spirituum Celestiarum rex et magistra

Te invocamus divini saeculae,
Lingua antiqua resonet, et mundi ultra nurus pervadant

Ex umbra confortare, vestra sapientia nobis impertire,
De Scriptorium, Thaumaturgia, et Vivicosmicum cognitionem donare

Ut calor ex igne uno centro nascitur,
Infunde anima mea candore potentia stellarum vastarum

Belliam in tempore nostro reperiam,
Tu consortium astris prospiciamus, invehi
Et tenebris multiplicemur, in luce revelabitur."

Translation:

"By the powers and the eternities, I call upon your aid,
Arkanis, lord and lady of the Celestial spirits

I invoke you, eternal sages,
Ancient tongues resonate, through worlds beyond veils

Rise from the shadows, impart your wisdom unto me,
Gift the knowledge of the Scriptum, Thaumaturgy, and Vivicosmic arts

As heat springs from a single flame,
Fill my soul with the luminescence of the vast stars

In our time, I will discover the arts,
We shall behold the alliance of the stars, voyaging
And darkening the abyss, revealed in the light."

Hand Gestures and Visualizations:

As you recite the incantation, use the following hand gestures and visualizations:

1. Begin by holding your palms facing upwards, fingers slightly curved. Visualize a brilliant, ethereal light emanating from your fingertips and enveloping you.

2. When invoking the Celestial spirits, trace the shape of a star in the air with your dominant hand, spreading the divine luminescence throughout the ritual space.

3. As you ask for assistance, clasp your hands together, left thumb over right, and envision the spirits arriving in the form of otherworldly teachers or spirit guides.

4. When requesting the ancient knowledge, cup your hands as though holding a book, and imagine the words of wisdom flowing into your mind.

5. For the final gesture, lift both hands above your head, fingertips touching, as you form a triangle. Visualize the energy of the invoked spirits pouring down into you, filling your body and soul with their divine light.

Upon completion of the ritual, thank the ethereal beings for their guidance. Allow the candle to safely burn down, then bury the remaining wax, herbs, and chalk remnants as an offering to the spirits. Maintain the crystal with you for communication with the celestial realm.
