## The Divine Omnipresence and the Gift of Human Free Will

**Introduction**:
Dear brothers and sisters, today, we shall delve into an exploration of two foundational concepts in Christian theology: God's omnipresence and the manifestation of human free will. The purpose of our exploration is first to grasp the intricate correlation between these concepts, then to highlight the potential paradoxes that may arise, and finally, to present thought-provoking resolutions to these paradoxes through the gift of The Word that is God.

### Part I: Moving Beyond the Surface
As we embark on this exploration, let us start by understanding the essence of God's omnipresence. **The Scripture tells us in Psalm 139**:7-10 (NIV), "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast." God's omnipresence signifies that He is present in all places and at all times.

On the other hand, human free will pertains to the capacity of individuals to make choices and decisions of their own volition. **This concept is illustrated in the Book of Deuteronomy 30**:19 (NIV), "This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live."

### Part II: The Interrelation between Omnipresence and Free Will
The Divine Presence emanates the principles of human free will, as we are created in His image and likeness (Genesis 1:26-27). A consequential example is when God granted Adam and Eve the capacity to choose in the Garden of Eden, as we read in Genesis 2:16-17 (ESV), “And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, ‘You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die.’”

God's omnipresence transcends time and space, allowing Him to foreknow the choices we will make. This foreknowledge, however, does not equate to interference with our free will. **In Romans 8**:29 (NIV), we read, “For those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son…” This verse showcases that God's divine plan works in tandem with our ability to choose, and not against it.

### Part III: Paradoxes and the Role of The Word that is God
A potential paradox arises when we contemplate God's omnipresence and our free will: If God is all-knowing and all-powerful, does He not already control the outcome of our choices? In response, we turn to Isaiah 55:8 (NKJV) that states, “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways.” The Way that is God possesses divine wisdom beyond human comprehension, enabling Him to work within the tension of this paradox.

Another paradox arises when considering the existence of evil in the world. If God is present everywhere and desires good for all creation, how can evil exist alongside this Divine Presence? Once again, we must acknowledge that free will is not an illusion, but a gift that God granted us to choose our path. **Ephesians 6**:12 (NIV) reminds us, “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” For the manifestation of human free will to be authentic, the presence of evil must persist as a possibility.

**Conclusion**:
As we conclude our in-depth sermon, let us be mindful that the intricate correlation between God's omnipresence and human free will is not a conundrum, but a divine marriage of principles that elucidate our existence's essence and purpose. Through The Word that is God, we are empowered to embrace our free will as a sacred gift and find solace in the knowledge that our Divine Creator is always with us, guiding our path, and ensuring we have the opportunity to choose and experience life in all its dimensions.
