Enochian Magic: History, Principles, and Practice

History and Origin

Enochian magic is an esoteric and occult branch of ceremonial magic rooted in the teachings of the sixteenth-century astrologer and occultist Dr. John Dee and his associate, seer Edward Kelley. In a series of scrying sessions, Dee and Kelley received communications from angelic entities who supposedly unveiled to them the mysteries of a unique magical system. This system claimed to have its foundations in the Enochian language, an angelic language said to have empowered the biblical figure, Enoch, to communicate directly with angelic beings. 

While the origin of Enochian magic is attributed to Dee and Kelley's angelic encounters, it should be noted that connections to other ancient esoteric systems such as Kabbalah, Gnosticism, and Hermeticism are also evident. Through its history and development, Enochian magic has been adopted, adapted, and integrated into various Western magical traditions, such as The Golden Dawn and Thelema.

Key Principles

One of the most striking aspects of Enochian magic is its focus on establishing direct communication with divine beings, or angels. The practitioner enters a dialogue with these entities, seeking their guidance and wisdom to achieve personal and spiritual growth, as well as specific magical objectives. Enochian magic is comprised of several interrelated systems that include, but are not limited to:

1. **The Enochian alphabet and language**: Enochian practitioners believe that learning to read, write, and pronounce the Enochian language is crucial for effective communication with angelic entities, as well as tapping into the latent powers imbued within the language itself.

2. **The Enochian chessboard**: The Enochian chessboard, or Enochian tablets, is composed of four elemental tablets (Air, Water, Earth, and Fire) divided into 12x13 grids, each representing a complex system of watchtowers, angels, and elemental forces. These tablets serve as metaphysical maps, tools for divination, and aids in invoking the powers of specific angels.

3. **The Great Table**: Also referred to as the "Table of Union," The Great Table provides a unified structure that consolidates all the aspects of Enochian magic, allowing for the interaction of cosmic forces, angelic hierarchies, and elemental powers.

Methods of Practice

Diving into Enochian magic generally requires dedication, study, and practice, cultivating patience in harnessing its power. **Here are some practical steps for students and practitioners looking to explore the Enochian system**:

1. **Study the Enochian Language**: Familiarize yourself with the Enochian alphabet, its pronunciation, and grammar. Mastery of the language is vital for connecting with angels and understanding their messages. Delve into primary texts such as Dee's journals, "Mysteriorum Libri Quinque" (Five Books of Mystery) and "A True and Faithful Relation" to gain a thorough understanding of the language.

2. **Acquire and Construct Magical Tools**: Crafting or obtaining essential items, such as the Enochian tablets, the Great Table, a Sigillum Dei Aemeth (Seal of God's Truth), and an Enochian chessboard is necessary for proper practice. Each tool carries distinct energetic signatures and purposes within the Enochian system.

3. **Meditate and Develop Psychic Abilities**: As with much of ceremonial magic, Enochian practitioners are encouraged to develop and refine their psychic and intuitive abilities, making it easier to establish contact with the angelic realm.

4. **Practice Invocations and Rituals**: Employ rituals and invocations designed for contacting individual angelic beings, elemental forces, or groups of entities. These ceremonies typically involve the recitation of Enochian calls - powerful invocations crafted in the Enochian language. 

Final Thoughts

Enochian magic is a rich, complex, and rewarding field of study for those who wish to explore the occult's depths. By carefully studying its foundational principles, delving into the Enochian language, and engaging with the prescribed rituals, practitioners can gain profound insights and unlock the transformative power of this mystical system.
