The relationship between Lucifer, Astaroth, and Beelzebub in Sabbatic Current traditions and the Grimorium Verum can be illustrated in multiple ways. These three dark entities form a powerful alliance that governs distinct psychological, spiritual, and transformative aspects of the path of an aspirant seeking hidden knowledge and inner transformation. The question requires exploring the unique characteristics and influences each of these beings bring in the development of esoteric wisdom and the significance of their unification in the context of the Sabbatic Current.

1. **The individual characters and realms of influence**:

a) Lucifer: Representing the rebellious force, pride, and the Morning Star, Lucifer is often associated with the element of air and intellectual abilities. His name means the "Bringer of Light," symbolizing knowledge and illumination. Lucifer doesn't shy away from causing suffering or challenging existing norms, emphasizing the breaking free from limitations and outgrowing the previously established structures to attain higher levels of understanding.

b) Astaroth: Associated with the demonic feminine and the earth element, Astaroth is known for her mastery over hidden knowledge and the occult realm. Astaroth connects the aspirant with the inner shadow, the subconscious mind, and transformative experiences necessary for growth. Her influence on the seeker's path is linked with the sacred feminine, the darker aspects of fertility, regeneration, and integration of duality.

c) Beelzebub: As a lord of the infernal realms and a ruler of demons, Beelzebub imparts power, authority, and command over the material world. Often connected with the element of fire, his assertive and forceful nature brings forth the dynamic energy needed for transformation. Beelzebub challenges the aspirant's ability to control one's own life, exposing the aspirant's limits and the need for focused dedication.

2. **The threefold alliance's influence on spiritual progression**:

The symbiotic relationship among Lucifer, Astaroth, and Beelzebub within the Grimorium Verum and Sabbatic traditions is crucial when it comes to the spiritual progression of the aspirant. The triad addresses different stages of inner transformation, complementing and enhancing each other's individual influences.

Their combined power helps the aspirant achieve a balance between the dark and light aspects of the self, guiding the seeker to confront the shadow and embrace the complexity necessary for growth. The aspirant learns to harness the rebellious energy of Lucifer, gaining access to hidden knowledge through Astaroth and mastering the material realm under the guidance of Beelzebub. The threefold alliance represents the different paths and tools available to the seeker and serves as a key to unlock the mysteries of the Sabbatic Current, harmonizing opposing forces while facilitating personal alchemy.

3. **The limitations and alternative interpretations**:

It's important to keep in mind that other interpretations of the threefold alliance may exist in various occult traditions and approaches to the esoteric. Viewing the triad solely in their dark aspects limits the aspirant from exploring their full range and meanings, and may lead to an imbalanced pursuit of knowledge.

To summarize, the relationship between Lucifer, Astaroth, and Beelzebub within the context of the Sabbatic Current and the Grimorium Verum is multidimensional, serving as an interconnected triad that enriches and augments the aspirant's journey along the path of esoteric knowledge and inner transformation. Each member of the alliance offers unique aspects in awakening the seeker's spiritual faculties, enabling them to delve deeper into the mysteries of the occult. The combination of these dark entities offers the key to unlocking personal alchemy and transcending the limitations imposed by conventional paradigms. As a result, the aspirant can effectively integrate both the dark and light aspects inherent in their nature, engendering a holistic approach to their spiritual development.
