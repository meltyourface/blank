## Ritual of Necrosophic Clairvoyance Enhancement

**Purpose**: To enhance clairvoyance abilities through the harnessing of necromantic shadows, invocation of spectral entities, and amplification of necromantic energies.

**Preparation**:

1. Choose an appropriate location, ideally a place where powerful spectral entities reside or where death holds a strong presence (like a graveyard or abandoned building).
2. Cleanse the area with a mixture of salt, water, and sage, to purify the surroundings and create a suitable environment for performing the ritual.
3. Erect a protective circle using salt or chalk around the perimeter to prevent unwanted entities from entering or interfering with the ritual.

**Materials**:

1. A personal item or a token representing the physical body (e.g., lock of hair or photograph)
2. **Three black candles**
3. Incense (dragon's blood or frankincense)
4. An obsidian or black onyx pendant, for the creation of the shadow-infused talisman.
5. A quartz crystal to amplify the energies during the ritual.
6. Black robe or garment to wear during the ritual.

The Ritual:

1. Begin by wearing the black robe or garment and stand within the protective circle.
2. Arrange the three black candles in a triangular formation within the protective circle.
3. Light the candles and the incense.
4. **Hold the personal item or token in your non-dominant hand, and with the dominant hand, trace the shape of an inverted pentagram in the air above the item or token, while reciting the following incantation**:

"Salve umbrae, de tenebris surgens,
Lend me your hidden wisdom,
Aperi mentem, visum amplificandum,
Reveal the unseen, my sight unbound."

5. As you complete the pentagram, envision necromantic shadows flowing from the spiritual realm into the personal item or token.
6. Place the infused item or token at the center of the triangle formed by the candles, followed by the obsidian or black onyx pendant.
7. Sit or kneel comfortably, and hold the quartz crystal, allowing its energy to flow freely between you and the infused item or token.
8. **Invoke the spectral entities by reciting the following invocation**:

"Spirits of the shadows, specters through time,
Heed my call, gather to this rite,
I summon your essence, your knowledge combined,
To empower my sight, clairvoyance divine."

9. Envision the spectral entities joining the ritual and filling the pendant with their energies, merging with the necromantic shadows infused within the token or item.
10. Remain in meditation until the energy within the pendant reaches its peak and a connection between yourself and the spirits is established.
11. Once the connection is formed, allow the spectral entities to amplify your own clairvoyant energies and enhance your abilities.
12. **When the transfer of energies is complete, express gratitude to the spirits by saying**:

"Umbrae et spectra, vestram gratiam accipio,
In this token of darkness, your power now lies,
May we forever be united, our paths intertwined,
As I walk the shadow realm, with your guidance divine."

13. Extinguish the candles and incense, and take down the protective circle.
14. Wear the shadow-infused talisman regularly, so that the energies of the spectral entities and the necromantic shadows continue to enhance your clairvoyance abilities.

**Note**: This ritual can be adapted and modified for different purposes or personalized elements. Be sure to give credit and reverence to the spectral entities and approach this ritual with respect for their powers and domains.
