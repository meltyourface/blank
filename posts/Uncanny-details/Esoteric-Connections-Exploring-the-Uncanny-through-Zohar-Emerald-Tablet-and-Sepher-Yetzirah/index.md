For this comparative analysis, I have selected passages from the Zohar, the Emerald Tablet, and the Sepher Yetzirah that contain multiple layers of meaning, symbolism, and esoteric interpretations. **The passages are as follows**: 

1. **Zohar**: "When the most mysterious hidden struck its aura, it struck and brought forth the spark." (Zohar I:15a)
2. **Emerald Tablet**: "That which is below is like that which is above; and that which is above is like that which is below, to work the miracles of one only thing." (Emerald Tablet, Verse 2)
3. **Sepher Yetzirah**: "Ten Sefirot of Nothingness: One is the Breath of the Living God...Two is the breath of breath." (Sepher Yetzirah 1:9)

The Zohar's passage is from the opening section of the text, describing the initial emanation of the divine light, the core of creation. This is significant in the esoteric world, as it represents a hidden movement occurring in the Uncanny realm, invisible to common awareness. The passage implies that the divine essence or higher reality touches our limited understanding of existence, manifesting as a spark. The aura struck could represent the spheres or Sefirot that later develop further into the Tree of Life in Kabbalistic tradition.

The passage from the Emerald Tablet is known as the foundational quote of the Hermetic philosophy. The statement emphasizes the interconnectedness of all planes of existence, transcending space and time through the miracles or phenomena born from a singular source. This resonates with the Zohar's emanation of divine light, implying that the blessings we encounter in our everyday lives emerge from a common origin. The phrase "as above, so below" has widespread repercussions in the esoteric and occult world, echoing in practices like alchemy and astrology. 

The Sepher Yetzirah's quote introduces the concept of the Ten Sefirot, the building blocks of creation originating from "nothingness" or the divine essence. The passage focuses on the Breath of the Living God, representing pure divine energy, and the second breath, generated from the first, denotes the creative power channeled through the Sefirot. The reference to breath resonates with the Uncanny concept of the hidden life force present in all beings and matter.

Comparing these passages, we can recognize similarities in their underlying meanings: the Zohar and the Sepher Yetzirah revolve around Kabbalistic principles, focusing on divine light emanations and the Ten Sefirot as essential elements of creation. The Emerald Tablet shares the common theme of interconnectedness, transcending spatial and temporal barriers. Another similarity is the interweaving of the Uncanny, manifesting as the hidden energies and forces governing existence in all quotes.

However, each passage contributes individual nuances to esoteric and occult knowledge. The Zohar's emphasis on mysterious origins, the Emerald Tablet's portrayal of the Hermetic Principle of Correspondence, and the Sepher Yetzirah's focus on the relationship between nothingness and divine breath showcase unique aspects of their respective spiritual traditions.

In summary, the passages from the Zohar, the Emerald Tablet, and the Sepher Yetzirah collectively enrich our understanding of the esoteric and occult practices as they converge and unveil elements of the Uncanny realm, ultimately revealing hidden wisdom running through all aspects of existence. Cross-references to Hermeticism and Kabbalah further underscore the intricate tapestry of ideas and principles present in such illuminated texts.
