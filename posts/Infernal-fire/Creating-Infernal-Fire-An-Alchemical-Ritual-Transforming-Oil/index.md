  Infernal Alchemy: Transmuting 500ml of Oil into Infernal Fire
  
  Materials Needed:
  1. 500ml of virgin olive oil
  2. Nefarious herbs: Belladonna, hemlock, and mandrake root
  3. Minerals: Sulfur, saltpeter, and black obsidian
  4. Sacred glyph papers (containing intricately drawn sigils of the infernal hierarchy)
  5. Charcoal incense burner with incense (preferably Dragon's Blood)
  6. A black stone altar
  7. A glass alchemical beaker/labware for heating oil
  
  **Warning: This ritual should not be attempted without proper knowledge and understanding. Proceed at your own risk.**
  
  Step-by-Step Process:
  
  1. Choose a location for the ritual. It must be a secluded area, free from interruptions or distractions.
  
  2. Confirm the timing of the ritual based on the lunar phase. The ideal time to perform this ritual is during the waning gibbous moon phase, when the moon's light is receding and dark, sinister energies are more potent.
  
  3. Prepare the area by cleansing it with smoke from the Dragon's Blood incense. Light the incense in the charcoal incense burner and allow the smoke to fill the space, banishing any unwanted energies.
  
  4. Arrange the sacred glyphs around the black stone altar, ensuring they are evenly spaced and pointing towards the center.
  
  5. Place the glass alchemical labware on the altar. Pour the 500ml of virgin olive oil into the labware.
  
  6. Crush the nefarious herbs (belladonna, hemlock, and mandrake) using a mortar and pestle. Combine equal parts of the crushed herbs and add them to the olive oil.
  
  7. Add equal parts of the minerals (sulfur, saltpeter, and black obsidian) into the labware.
  
  8. Begin heating the labware containing the olive oil mixture over a low flame. This can be done using an alchemical heating device or a simple bunsen burner.
  
  9. As the oil begins to simmer, speak the unholy incantations given below, focusing your energy on the oil mixture and the sigils surrounding it.
  
  - Incantation (chant the following three times): *Per ignem infernalis transmutatio oleum fit flammas enim averni!* (By the infernal fire, I transmute this oil into the flames of the underworld!)
  
  10. Once the oil has reached a simmer, watch as it undergoes a transformation. The oil will gradually change color and consistency, taking on a vivid red-orange hue.
  
  11. When the transformation is complete, carefully pour the now-transmuted Infernal fire into a fireproof container. Use caution, as Infernal fire is significantly more potent and dangerous than ordinary fire.
  
  12. To extinguish the Infernal fire, it must be smothered using a mixture of ash and holy water. It cannot be extinguished by conventional means.
