  Sigil Design:
  
  To begin, first sketch a circle as the outer border of the sigil. The circle represents the infinite and cyclical nature of the Infernal fire.
  
  Within the circle, incorporate the runes and demonic symbols for the four specific aspects:
  
  1. Destructive potential: Draw a stylized, flaming sword, referencing the "Zagan" sigil from The Lesser Key of Solomon. Zagan, a powerful demon king, is known for his ability to transform and manipulate matter. By incorporating Zagan's symbol of a sword wreathed in flames, the sigil gains a strong connection to destructive power and force.
  
  2. Purification: Integrate the alchemical symbol for fire (a triangle with the apex pointing upwards) within the flaming sword. This symbol represents fire as an agent of purification and transformation, burning away impurities and leaving only purity.
  
  3. Fathomless depths: Add the "Leviathan's Cross," an infinity sign with a double cross below it, which signifies the limitless depth and knowledge of the deep and dangerous unknown. It adds a connection to darker mysteries within the sigil.
  
  4. Resilience: Within the flaming sword, draw the rune "Uruz," which symbolizes strength, resilience, vitality, and survival. This rune empowers the sigil with the unyielding nature of the Infernal fire and the will to endure and overcome all obstacles.
  
  Infernal Correspondences:
  
  1. Destructive potential: Zagan
  2. Purification: Fire as an alchemical element (The Lesser Key of Solomon)
  3. Fathomless depths: Leviathan (The Lesser Key of Solomon)
  4. Resilience: Uruz Rune (Elder Futhark Runes)
  
  Ritual for Activation and Invocation:
  
  1. Timing: Perform the ritual during the waning moon, preferably the night of a lunar eclipse, as the waning lunar energy enhances Infernal fire's destructive potential and cleansing power.
  
  2. Preparation: Cleanse the ritual space with sage or a similar purifying herb and place a black or red altar cloth on a flat surface in the center of the space. 
  
  3. Offerings: Light three black candles in a triangle formation on the altar. In the middle of the triangle, place a chalice filled with a flammable liquid like brandy and a small copper bowl containing a mixture of cayenne pepper, ashes, and iron filings.
  
  4. Incantation: Holding the sigil above the burning candles, recite the following incantation:
  
  "O, potent Zagan, Leviathan of the deep,
  Uruz, of resilience reaped,
  By fire's grace, I summon thee,
  Ignite this sigil, set it free."
  
  5. Activation: Carefully dip the sigil in the flammable liquid and then hold it above one of the black candles until it catches fire. Allow the sigil to burn while focusing deeply on the intentions and purpose of the ritual. 
  
  6. Completion: Let the sigil burn until it's reduced to ash. Mix the ash with the contents of the small copper bowl, forming a powerful and potent ritual powder. Use the powder to draw the sigil on objects, doorways, or even the skin, whenever its powers are needed. Always extinguish the candles in reverse order after completing the ritual.
  
  Warning: This ritual is intended for experienced practitioners well-versed in infernal elements and should be undertaken with maximum care and respect for the associated entities and energies.
