In answering this knowledge challenge, let us first delve into the background context of Brian Evenson's works and conjuration as an occult practice, followed by a detailed analysis of the thematic elements and narrative techniques used by the author. Lastly, we will explore how this understanding may alter one's perception of reality within fictional and metaphysical worlds.

Background Context

Brian Evenson is an American fiction author, primarily known for his works in the horror, existential, and psychological thriller genres. Combining elements of the grotesque and supernatural with profound philosophical mindscapes, Evenson unearths the chasms residing in the human psyche. Meanwhile, conjuration as an occult practice refers to the art of summoning spirits, entities, or energies using rituals and incantations. This ancient practice attempts to bridge the connection between the tangible and the arcane, thus emphasizing the permeability between the worlds of the living and the supernatural.

Thematic Elements

1. ****The Blurring of Reality and the Supernatural****: Evenson's writing frequently incorporates instances where the mundane suddenly becomes enmeshed in the supernatural. Characters experience disturbing, transformative events that require them to confront unknown, unnatural forces. By juxtaposing the ordinary with the extraordinary, the author challenges the readers' preconceived notions of reality.

2. ****Human Fragility****: Many of Evenson's narratives grapple with the vulnerability of human characters when plunged into situations that push them beyond their psychological limits. These moments often expose deep-seated fears and anxieties, demonstrating how the supernatural can serve as a catalyst for exploring the human condition's mental and emotional thresholds.

3. ****The Reliability of Perception****: As his characters navigate supernatural experiences, they often question their understanding of reality and the trustworthiness of their senses. By plunging his readers into these disquieting states of uncertainty, Evenson raises questions regarding the nature of reality and the degree to which human perception is malleable.

Narrative Techniques

1. ****The Unreliable Narrator****: Evenson deftly employs the unreliable narrator technique to instill doubt in his readers. By presenting stories from the perspective of characters who are experiencing psychological trauma, paranoia, or instability, he emphasizes the porous boundaries between reality and the supernatural.

2. ****Ambiguity****: The author deliberately fosters ambiguity in his narratives, refusing to provide definitive explanations for eerie developments and supernatural events. This leaves readers questioning their interpretations of the story events, paralleling the characters' confusion, and creating eerie uncertainty.

3. ****Symbolism****: Evenson infuses his narratives with symbols that gesture towards the occult and the supernatural â€“ such as ritualistic acts, cryptic symbols, and otherworldly beings. These symbols function as analogies or glimpses into hidden realms, serving as a bridge to access other planes of existence.

Enhancing One's Perception of Reality

Understanding the thematic elements and narrative techniques in Brian Evenson's work, particularly revolving around the intersection of the mundane and supernatural realms, can enhance an individual's perception of reality in several ways:

1. ****Encouraging a Critical Examination of Reality****: Recognizing the malleability of human perception and the porous borders between the mundane and supernatural, as exposed in Evenson's writings, makes readers more cognizant of the subjective nature of reality and the potential for alternate interpretations of events.

2. ****Subverting Preconceived Notions****: Unsettling encounters with the supernatural challenge established norms and rational structures, prompting readers to question their assumptions about the world and fostering open-mindedness.

3. ****Exploring the Limits of Human Experience****: As Evenson's characters navigate extraordinary situations, they lay bare raw human emotions and vulnerabilities, giving readers an opportunity to empathize, contemplate, and learn from these experiences and their metaphysical implications.

To summarize, Brian Evenson's works offer a compelling exploration of the convergence between the mundane and supernatural realms. Flourishing on thematic elements such as the blurring of reality, human fragility, and perception unreliability, as well as narrative techniques including the unreliable narrator, ambiguity, and symbolism, his stories provoke introspection and challenge conventional boundaries of reality. As readers engage with such texts, their perception of reality within both fictional and metaphysical worlds may widen, granting them the ability to question, reevaluate, and reconsider their understanding of the world.
