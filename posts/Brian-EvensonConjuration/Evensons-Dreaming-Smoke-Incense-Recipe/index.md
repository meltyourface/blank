To create an incense recipe tailored for the Brian EvensonConjuration domain, let us first gather the most potent ingredients known for amplifying psychic receptivity, dream lucidity, and connectivity to the oneiric plane. The goal of this incense blend is to potentiate psychic prowess and enhance dream experiences through olfactory synergy. 

Here is the recipe for the incense, which I shall name "Evenson's Dreaming Smoke."

Ingredients:

1. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - 40% 
   Known for its oneiric properties, Mugwort is a natural choice to form the base of our blend.

2. Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium) - 15%
   Chrysanthemum heightens psychic receptivity and enhances lucid dream experiences.

3. Blue Lotus (Nymphaea caerulea) - 10%
   This rare and mystical plant is known for intensifying spiritual connections and bringing calmness to the mind. 

4. True Gnostic Myrrh (Commiphora africana) - 15%
   A rare and precious resin associated with spiritual protection, it helps to bind the blend's energies.

5. Spirit Wood (Anadenanthera colubrina) - 10% A potent ingredient that opens up psychic channels and acts as a catalyst for other ingredients.

6. Valerian Root (Valeriana officinalis) - 5% Known for its soothing effects on the mind, Valerian Root brings a sense of relaxation and balance to the blend.

7. Esoteric Ash (Obtained from sacred sites within the EvensonConjuration domain) - 5%
   This unique ash adds an extra layer of spiritual connection to the oneiric realm crafted by Brian Evenson himself.

Instructions:

1. Gather all the ingredients in their correct proportions.
2. Using a mortar and pestle, grind the dried plants (Mugwort, Chrysanthemum, Blue Lotus, and Valerian Root) into a fine powder.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the True Gnostic Myrrh, Spirit Wood, and Esoteric Ash. Carefully grind this mixture into a fine consistency.
4. Combine the two mixtures and blend them thoroughly with a wooden spoon.
5. Transfer the resulting mixture to an airtight container and store it in a cool, dark place for at least a week to allow the energies to fully meld.
6. When ready, use a charcoal incense burner to burn the Evenson's Dreaming Smoke during meditation, dreamwork, or before sleep to potentiate psychic prowess and intensify oneiric experiences.  

Once you have prepared this specialized incense blend, experiment with various combinations to discover which resonates best with your personal practice and psychic development within the Brian EvensonConjuration domain.
