---**Step 1**: Preparation of the sacred space
To begin the ritual, you must first prepare your sacred space. Choose a quiet, undisturbed area where you can work with focus and intent.

1.1. Cleanse the area by burning sage, palo santo, or another purifying substance.
1.2. **Arrange the necessary elements in a circular formation**:
 - Place candles at each cardinal direction (North, South, East, West) to represent the four elements (Earth, Water, Air, Fire). **Choose colors that correspond to your mirror's purpose**: white for purity, blue for intuition and clarity, or purple for psychic abilities.
 - Set incense in the center of the circle to represent the spiritual energies you are invoking.
 - Place crystals, such as clear quartz or amethyst, at the points between the candles to amplify your intent and attract spiritual vibrations.
1.3. In front of you, within the circle, place a stand to hold the steel mirror.
**Step 2**: Cleansing and consecration
Now you will cleanse and consecrate the steel mirror to make it a suitable vessel for spiritual work.

2.1. Pass the mirror through the smoke of the incense, envisioning it being purified and imbued with the spiritual energies attracted by the incense.
2.2. Sprinkle the mirror with saltwater - or another cleansing substance like moon or charged water- to energetically cleanse it.
2.3. Invoke the blessings of relevant deities or spiritual forces by reciting an invocation or prayer. Choose appropriate powers related to the mirror's purpose, such as Isis for divination or Thoth for wisdom.
**Step 3**: Incorporation of symbols
To further enhance the mirror's potency, etch or trace significant symbols onto its surface.

3.1. Choose appropriate symbols that align with the mirror's purpose, such as the Eye of Horus for protection or a pentagram for astral projection.
3.2. Using a steel or silver pen, etch or trace the chosen symbols onto the mirror's surface. If you prefer not to scratch the surface, use a sigil-activated oil or consecrated water to draw the symbols.
**Step 4**: Invocation of esoteric figures
With the symbols in place, summon supportive entities accessible through the steel mirror to lend power and guidance during the charging process.

4.1. Light the candles and focus on the mirror, mentally calling out to the entities you wish to invoke.
4.2. Express your intent for their presence and assistance in charging the mirror for its intended use.
4.3. Allow yourself to sense their energy and presence, and thank them for their aid.
**Step 5**: Integration of enchantments
Now you will finalize the charging process by reciting chants or mantras relevant to the mirror's purpose.

5.1. Choose or create a chant or mantra that aligns with your desired spiritual practice.
5.2. Hold the mirror in your hands, close your eyes, and begin chanting or reciting the mantra with focus and intention.
5.3. Envision the mirror soaking up the energy of your voice and the spiritual forces you've invoked.
**Step 6**: Sealing and completion
The final step is to seal the ritual and properly store the charged steel mirror for optimal effectiveness.

6.1. Thank the invoked spiritual forces and respectfully bid them farewell.
6.2. Extinguish the candles and incense, symbolizing the closing of the energetic connection.
6.3. Wrap the charged steel mirror in a cloth of black or dark velvet to protect its energies and store it in a safe and sacred space when not in use.
