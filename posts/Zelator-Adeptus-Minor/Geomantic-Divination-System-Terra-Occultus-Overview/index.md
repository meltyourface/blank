Geomantic Divination System: Terra Occultus

1. **Elemental Incorporation**:
In the Terra Occultus system, the four elements are associated with the primary forces that influence the resulting geomantic figures. **Each element governs a particular aspect of interpretation**:

- Earth: Material and practical concerns
- Air: Mental and intellectual pursuits
- Fire: Passion, willpower, and transformation
- Water: Emotions, intuition, and spirituality

2. **Geomantic Figures**:

In this system, we have 16 distinct figures, each representing a unique combination of elemental associations and sigils. **The figures are as follows**:

1. **Earth's Foundation (Earth, Earth)**: Stability, grounding, structure
2. **Air's Insight (Air, Air)**: Clarity, communication, ideas
3. **Fire's Ignition (Fire, Fire)**: Passion, willpower, motivation
4. **Water's Depths (Water, Water)**: Intuition, emotion, healing

5. **Earth and Air (Earth, Air)**: Material growth, learning, adaptation
6. **Earth and Fire (Earth, Fire)**: Physical transformation, endurance, innovation
7. **Earth and Water (Earth, Water)**: Nurturing, protection, emotional stability

8. **Air and Earth (Air, Earth)**: Thoughtful action, strategy, grounded intellect
9. **Air and Fire (Air, Fire)**: Inspiration, risk-taking, enthusiasm
10. **Air and Water (Air, Water)**: Emotional intelligence, empathy, inner wisdom

11. **Fire and Earth (Fire, Earth)**: Energy, productivity, ambition
12. **Fire and Air (Fire, Air)**: Creativity, quick thinking, leadership
13. **Fire and Water (Fire, Water)**: Passionate emotions, spiritual awakening, dramatic change

14. **Water and Earth (Water, Earth)**: Harmony, balance, comfort
15. **Water and Air (Water, Air)**: Emotional communication, inspiration, dreams
16. **Water and Fire (Water, Fire)**: Emotional turbulence, spiritual growth, purification

3. **Methodical Process**:

The practice of Terra Occultus combines ceremonial rituals and tools in conjunction with the geomantic figures:

1. Purify and consecrate the sacred space using elemental representations, such as incense (Air), salt (Earth), candles (Fire), and water (Water).

2. Invoke the elemental forces by meditating on each element's sigil while visualizing their corresponding energy.

3. Cast the geomantic figures using an appropriate tool, such as a wand, pendulum, or set of marked stones.

4. Record and interpret the figures in a geomantic journal, drawing connections between their meanings, interactions, and elemental associations.

4. **Astrological Correspondences**:

Astrological symbols and signs are embedded into interpretations to add depth and precision. **Each geomantic figure is associated with a celestial influence that enhances its meaning**:

1. **Earth's Foundation**: Taurus (Fixed Earth)
2. **Air's Insight**: Libra (Cardinal Air)
3. **Fire's Ignition**: Leo (Fixed Fire)
4. **Water's Depths**: Cancer (Cardinal Water)
[...]

Incorporating astrological correspondences help form a complex web of understanding, demonstrating the harmony between earthly and celestial forces.

5. **Sample Spread**:

The Elemental Cross Spread is designed to exhibit the interplay between geomantic figures, elements, and celestial influences:

1. **Center (Present Situation)**: Represents the querent's current state
2. **Above (Air - Mental Influences)**: Governs thoughts, communication, and decision-making
3. **Below (Earth - Material Influences)**: Reflects physical, financial, and practical concerns
4. **Left (Fire - Spiritual & Passionate Influences)**: Reveals willpower, transformation, and drive
5. **Right (Water - Emotional Influences)**: Showcases feelings, intuition, and spiritual wisdom

6. **Initiation Ritual**:

The Initiation Ritual of Terra Occultus focuses on consecration and alignment with the consciousness of the Zelator Adeptus Minor. **This ritual consists of the following steps**:

1. Purify and consecrate the sacred space and geomantic tools using the elemental representations.
2. Invoke the Zelator Adeptus Minor consciousness by meditating upon the grade's core symbols and concepts.
3. Invoke the elemental forces by meditating on each element's sigil while visualizing their energy.
4. Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram to align the practitioner's energies and protect the sacred space.
5. Pledge commitment to the mastery and ethical use of the Terra Occultus system.
6. Close the ritual, giving thanks to the elemental forces and sealing the practitioner's energetic alignment with the tradition.
