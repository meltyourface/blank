In answering this knowledge challenge, we will first need to understand the Thelemic axiom "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," and then identify the connection between the trinity of Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit in relation to finding one's True Will. Finally, we will demonstrate how the realization of this Will can shape one's understanding of the interconnectedness among the three deities.

The Thelemic axiom "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" is the foundational ethical statement of Thelema, a spiritual philosophy established by the English mystic Aleister Crowley. This statement should not be misunderstood as advocating hedonistic or selfish pursuits; it is a call to discover and pursue one's True Will, a concept central to Thelema, which refers to the authentic purpose or calling of an individual, in harmony with the divine and the universe.

Now, let's delve into the trinity of Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit and their connection in relation to finding one's True Will. Nuit, also known as Nut, represents the infinite, the boundless expanse of the universe, the night sky, and the embodiment of every possibility. She is often visualized as a starry, naked goddess arching across the heavens. In contrast, Hadit is the infinitesimal point, the origin of all things, and the inner flame that drives our Will. He represents the individual consciousness, the flame that burns within the soul, guiding us towards our True Will. Ra-Hoor-Khuit - an amalgamation of the ancient Egyptian solar deities Ra and Horus - is the manifestation of the union between Nuit and Hadit and represents dynamic, active, and vital energy, effectively symbolizing the realization and expression of one's True Will in the world.

The connection between the trinity and the pursuit of one's True Will is evident in their complementary natures. Nuit represents the limitless potential of existence, while Hadit symbolizes the individual's unique path, purpose, and drive. Together, they combine to form Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the active, forceful energy by which a person's True Will is realized and expressed. This means that by discovering their True Will and living in accordance with it, an individual can experience harmony with the divine trinity and, in essence, contribute to the cosmic dance of the universe's energy, as represented by Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

Additionally, realizing one's True Will naturally shapes the understanding of the interconnectedness of these deities. Nuit and Hadit represent the cosmic duality and balance between the infinite and the finite, potential and purpose. In their union, they give birth to Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the active force which aids individuals in the pursuit of their True Will. By manifesting one's True Will, the individual engages with and becomes a part of this eternal cycle, recognizing the inherent connection between their own divine purpose and the cosmic forces of Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Ultimately, this offers a profound sense of unity, purpose, and harmony in one's life, as they become aware of their role in the divine play of existence.

In conclusion, the trinity of Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit is intimately connected to the discovery and pursuit of one's True Will within the philosophy of Thelema. By exploring and realizing their True Will, an individual experiences profound interconnectedness with the three deities, recognizing the cosmic balance and harmony inherent in their combined existence. This realization leads to a deeper understanding of the intricate dance of the universe, as well as the significance and the necessity for each individual being to discover and live in accordance with their True Will, continually participating in the dynamic cycle of cosmic energy as embodied by Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.
