  For this reading, I will use the Rider-Waite Tarot deck, which is well known for its rich and complex imagery. I will draw one card for each of the three specific aspects - the individual's current situation, the obstacles they face, and the potential outcome.
  
  1. Individual's Current Situation: The Star
  The Star depicts a naked woman kneeling by a small pond, pouring water from two vessels, surrounded by seven small stars and one large bright star above her head. Her stance is open and relaxed, signifying balance and harmony.
  
  In the current situation, The Star signifies hope, inspiration, and spiritual guidance from a higher power. The individual is at a point of attaining greater spiritual clarity, or perhaps experiencing unrivaled serenity and connection to the universe. The stars in the card represent not only spiritual guidance but also the seven classical planets in astrology, influencing the individual's mystical growth. The water poured symbolizes the flow of emotions and the collective unconscious, hinting at connections with emotional and psychic energy.
  
  2. Obstacles: Nine of Swords
  The Nine of Swords shows a person in their bed, sitting up with their head in their hands, overwhelmed by grief and despair. Above the bed, nine swords hang on the wall, reflecting the oppressive weight of mental suffering.
  
  The obstacles faced revolve primarily around anxiety, guilt, or the fear of facing certain challenges or issues. This card signifies that the individual might be their own worst enemy, overwhelmed by their thoughts and emotions. Besides, the number nine in numerology represents completion, suggesting that the person faces an inevitable culmination of some emotional turmoil or worry. The solution here involves confronting these fears and anxieties, seeking therapeutic or spiritual support to clear the mind and release the emotional burden.
  
  3. Potential Outcome: The Magician
  In The Magician card, we see an individual standing in front of a table, with symbols of all four suits (swords, cups, wands, and pentacles). Holding a wand in one hand and pointing towards the Earth with the other, The Magician channels cosmic energy, embodying the Hermetic principle "as above, so below."
  
  The potential outcome shows great mastery, creativity, and the ability to manifest reality according to the individual's will. This card suggests harnessing personal power, tapping into the spiritual essence present in The Star card, and using it to overcome the challenges represented by the Nine of Swords. In terms of astrology, The Magician corresponds to Mercury, the messenger of gods, and further strengthens the idea of verbal and mental prowess. As a number one in the Major Arcana, The Magician signifies new beginnings and progress driven by a strong intuition and self-confidence.
  
  To summarize this cartomantic reading, the individual is currently experiencing spiritual growth and guidance, nurturing hope for what lies ahead. The challenge lies in overcoming inner fears and anxieties that work against their progress. By harnessing their spiritual and mental power, as well as drawing strength from supportive resources, they can overcome these obstacles and become a master of their own reality. Manifestation, creative solutions, and cultivating a strong sense of self will be the keys to their success.
