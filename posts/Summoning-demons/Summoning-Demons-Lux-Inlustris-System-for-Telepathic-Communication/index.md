After thorough research and experimentation, I have developed the innovative and complex Lux Inlustris System for conjuring a demon. Instead of verbally articulating the incantation, this method employs telepathic communication, enchanted objects, and potent ancient symbols.

Overview of the Lux Inlustris System:

1. Preparation Phase: Gather and create the necessary enchanted objects and materials.

2. Symbol Inscription Phase: Inscribe the ancient symbols onto parchment or craft them into talismans.

3. Connection and Invocation Phase: Establish a telepathic connection with the demon and perform the incantation mentally.

4. Augmentation and Control Phase: Enhance the efficacy of the summoning process and maintain control over the summoned demon.

Phase 1: Preparation
Materials required:
- A sigil of the demon to be summoned
- A handcrafted talisman made of silver or gold
- A parchment made from the skin of a black goat
- Enchanted ink created from the ashes of a protection spell-infused sage bundle mixed with blood from the summoner
- A circle of protection made from black salt and powdered obsidian
- An offering (specific to the demon's desires)
- A ritual knife
- Sanctified candles (preferably black and red)

Phase 2: Symbol Inscription
1. Draw the demon's sigil onto the handcrafted talisman using the enchanted ink.
2. Inscribe a series of ancient symbols around the sigil on the parchment, giving attention to each symbol's energy charging by using the ritual knife for added precision.

Phase 3: Connection and Invocation
1. Place the talisman, parchment, offering, and candles in the center of the salt and obsidian circle.
2. Sit calmly outside the circle, focusing your thoughts on the demon's sigil and ancient symbols.
3. Establish a telepathic connection with the demon by mentally reciting the incantation three times. Visualize the symbols and the talisman glowing, channeling the energy required for the summoning process.

Phase 4: Augmentation and Control
1. Using your mental and emotional power, strengthen the connection to the demon by amplifying your focus on the telepathic link.
2. Maintain control over the summoned demon by asserting your dominance through the telepathic connection, using the engraved symbols on the talisman and parchment as active anchors for this control.
3. Present the offering to the demon, signifying your intention to work with it harmoniously and respectfully.
4. Keep the enchanted talisman with the sigil and ancient symbols nearby during your interaction with the demon to ensure control is maintained.

The Lux Inlustris System integrates the best elements of telepathic communication, enchanted objects, and ancient symbols to create an intricate and powerful summoning experience. By following these precise, arcane instructions, the summoner can effectively conjure and control a demon without ever needing to utter a verbal incantation.
