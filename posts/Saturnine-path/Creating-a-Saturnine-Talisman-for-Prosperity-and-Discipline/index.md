1. After extensive research, I concluded that the key symbols and sigils associated with the Saturnine path related to prosperity and discipline are the glyph of Saturn (♄), the sigil of Saturn, and the symbol of Capricorn (♑). Prosperity is represented by the image of the cornucopia, while discipline is represented by the whip and chain. Given the Saturnine affinity for structure and order, I have also integrated the hexagon and cube, two common Saturnian symbols.

2. The ruling planetary energy of Saturn is associated with discipline, limitation, responsibility, and structure. The zodiacal sign of Capricorn is correlated with ambition, practicality, and persistence. Inherent correspondences include the colors black and dark blue, grounding and protection stones like onyx and obsidian, and plants like cypress and Solomon's seal.

3. The design begins with the sigil of Saturn as the central element of the talisman, surrounded by the Capricorn symbol and overlain with the cornucopia and whip to represent prosperity and discipline, respectively. Embedded within the hexagon is a cube, to incorporate the influence of Saturn's rigid structure and order.

The outer border consists of a series of interlocking hexagons, creating a larger geometric pattern that adheres to the principles of sacred geometry, while reflecting the Saturnian emphasis on structure and stability. The spaces within the border contain Saturn's glyph, grounding stones, and plant symbols, further emphasizing the energy of the planet.

4. To charge and consecrate this sigil:

- Choose a day and time ruled by Saturn, such as Saturday, during a planetary hour of the planet.
- Conduct a purifying ritual to cleanse the workspace and yourself.
- Surround the sigil with chosen grounding stones, like onyx or obsidian, and Saturn-related plants, such as cypress or Solomon's seal.
- Light black or dark blue candles at each corner of the hexagonal border, invoking the energy of Saturn.
- Raise your energy and intone specific Saturnian invocations or mantras, such as "AGIEL, ZAZEL, ARATHRON, SANCTA TERRA PATER SATURNUS (Holy Earth Father Saturn), I conjure and charge this sigil with your essence, imbuing it with the power to attract and sustain prosperity and discipline within my life."
- Visualize a beam of dark blue energy connecting the sigil to the planet Saturn, facilitating a continuous flow of Saturn's influence and energy.
- Allow the candles to burn out, signifying the completion of the charging process.
- Carry the sigil, display it in your domain, or use it in subsequent workings to strengthen the connection with the Saturnian influence of prosperity and discipline.

By following these guidelines, you will have created and charged a potent Saturnian talisman that harnesses the power of the esoteric and occult Saturnine path to manifest prosperity and discipline within your life.
