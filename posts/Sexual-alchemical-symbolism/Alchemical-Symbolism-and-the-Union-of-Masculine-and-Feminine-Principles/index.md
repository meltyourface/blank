In order to analyze and draw connections between the Hermetic principle "As above, so below; as below, so above" and the transformative union of the masculine and feminine aspects within the practitioner, let us first contextualize the principle and its relationship to Sexual-alchemical symbolism. Following this, we will delve into notable alchemical texts and symbols that illustrate these connections.

The Hermetic principle, "As above, so below; as below, so above," originates from the Emerald Tablet, a foundational text of Hermeticism, which encompasses both philosophical and practical disciplines focused on attaining wisdom, spiritual power, and material success. This principle underlies the belief in the microcosm-macrocosm correlation: the idea that the workings of the universe (macrocosm) are mirrored within each human being (microcosm), and vice versa. Essentially, the human being is a smaller reflection of the universe, and the universe, in turn, is a greater reflection of the human being.

In the context of Sexual-alchemical symbolism, this Hermetic principle encompasses the notion that inner transformation mirrors outer transformation and is reflected through the integration and union of opposites. Specifically, these opposites manifest as the masculine and feminine principles. By achieving equilibrium between these two aspects, an individual is believed to unlock a higher state of spirituality, knowledge, and power. This transformative process transcends the physical realm and is understood as a psycho-spiritual process, in which sexual energy becomes a metaphor for transformative power.

Now that we have contextualized the Hermetic principle and its relation to Sexual-alchemical symbolism, let us turn our attention to notable alchemical texts and symbols to further examine these connections.

1. The Rosarium Philosophorum: This pivotal alchemical text, written in the 16th century, features various engravings illustrating the stages of alchemical transformation. A particularly relevant image in this context depicts the coniunctio (conjunction), which represents the union of the masculine (Sol, the Sun King) and feminine (Luna, the Moon Queen) aspects. The alchemical metaphor of Sol and Luna symbolizes not only the balance between polarities, but also the importance of human sexuality and pairings in achieving sublime transformation. The interplay between these two elements mirrors the Hermetic principle by revealing the mirroring effect between the macrocosm (Sol-Luna) and the microcosm (the alchemist).

2. The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz: This 17th-century allegorical text, significant within the context of Rosicrucianism, describes a journey towards spiritual transformation. The protagonist, Christian Rosenkreutz, partakes in a wedding between a royal couple, symbolic of their unification giving birth to a new, divine reality. The hermaphroditic figure in this narrative embodies the union of opposites – the masculine and feminine aspects – thus representing the harmony sought after in the alchemical process. This harmony resonates with the Hermetic principle by suggesting that personal transformation (as below) can engender universal advancement (as above).

3. The Rebis: Another emblem reflective of the union of masculine and feminine aspects is the Rebis – a symbol depicting a hermaphroditic figure. This symbol, which appears in numerous alchemical texts and portrays the fusion of Sol and Luna, emphasizes the significance of achieving harmony between the opposing forces within an individual. Once again, the Rebis elucidates the mirroring dynamic between microcosm and macrocosm, resonating with the Hermetic principle.

In summary, the Hermetic principle "As above, so below; as below, so above" can be understood within the context of Sexual-alchemical symbolism through the practitioner's pursuit of equilibrium between the masculine and feminine aspects, often represented as Sol and Luna respectively. By unifying these polarizing forces, a transformative power is unleashed, connecting the individual transformation (below) to the universal transformation (above). Texts such as the Rosarium Philosophorum and The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, along with symbols such as the Rebis, effectively illustrate the connection between this Hermetic principle and the pursuit of harmony between masculine and feminine aspects in Sexual-alchemical symbolism.
