## Title: Elixir of Purity: A Mystical Antidote for the Curse of the Grade

**Ingredients**:
1. 2 tbsp of Mugwort - for protection against malevolent energies
2. 1 tbsp of Angelica root - to amplify divine guidance and connection
3. 2 tsp of Wormwood - to purify spiritual afflictions and reveal hidden knowledge
4. 1 tsp of Vervain - to balance and harmonize energies
5. A pinch of Sea salt - for cleansing and grounding
6. 1 quartz crystal - for amplifying the energetic properties of the elixir
7. 1 protective talisman - dedicated to your personal guardian or deity

**Preparation**:

1. On a night with a powerful celestial correspondence, such as a full or new moon, gather the herbs and ingredients. Align the creation of the elixir to the appropriate astrological and planetary influences.

2. Begin by purifying your workspace and ingredients. Light a white candle and cleanse the area with the smoke of sage or palo santo.

3. Macerate the Mugwort, Angelica root, Wormwood, and Vervain with a mortar and pestle, focusing your intention on the purpose of purification and breaking the curse.

4. Bring 500ml of pure, spring water to a gentle boil in an iron or copper cauldron. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer.

5. Add the macerated herbs into the simmering water, stirring slowly in a clockwise motion. Add the pinch of sea salt and continue to mix carefully.

6. As the herbs infuse, recite the following incantation:
   "By the power of the ancient ones,
    By the wisdom of the celestial guides,
    Break the curse that binds my fate,
    Purify my soul and transform my state."

7. Allow the herbal mixture to simmer under a low flame for approximately 30 minutes. During this time, maintain your focus on the elixir's intentions, and continue reciting the incantation if necessary.

8. Once the elixir has brewed, remove it from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.

9. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh or cheesecloth, and carefully transfer the liquid into a glass container. Ensure the quartz crystal and protective talisman are washed and cleansed, then submerge them in the elixir.

10. Seal the container and place it in a safe, dark space to consecrate and charge for at least three days, under the celestial influence chosen.

To Use:

1. Upon completion of the consecration period, retrieve the elixir.

2. Each day, for seven consecutive days, consume two tablespoons of the elixir while visualizing the curse being broken.

3. On the seventh day, remove the quartz crystal and protective talisman from the elixir before completing the final consumption. Carry the talisman with you for continued protection.
