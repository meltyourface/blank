Component 1: Invocation of the guiding spirits or deities
Begin by lighting a white candle and placing it on your altar or a sacred space. **Meditate to clear your mind of distractions and to connect with your inner source of power. Call upon the guiding spirits or deities associated with healing and protection, such as Archangel Raphael, Hecate, or Brigid. Your invocation should be heartfelt and sincere, acknowledging the presence and assistance of these entities. Repeat the following chant three times**:

"Healing spirits, deities so pure,
Today I ask for your aid and a cure,
Join me in this rite, protect and guide,
As I cleanse this aura from evil, cast aside."

Component 2: Configuration of a sacred space
Before the client enters, prepare the sacred space by drawing a circle with white chalk or salt to define the area where the person will stand. Place four crystals representing the four elements (Earth - smoky quartz, Air - clear quartz, Fire - carnelian, and Water - amethyst) at each cardinal point, east, west, south, and north. Draw healing sigils on small parchment papers and arrange them around the circle. In close vicinity, have the person step into the sacred space.

Component 3: Enchanted incantations
Hold your hands above your heart and begin chanting the following incantation in either Enochian or ancient Sumerian:

"Es-vukh-na alerns vay-kiri-ertun,
Omin Nama-hor-din,
Kor-ta, an-goth ta ku-rin,
Symmennae purify, Ilyarat expel sin!"

Repeat the incantation three times, with growing intensity. As you do this, visualize a beam of light emanating from your heart and expanding to engulf the individual.

Component 4: Energy transfer technique
Now, hold your charged wand or place your right hand on the person's heart center and your left hand on their Sacral Chakra. As you connect with their energy, picture a white healing light flowing from your right hand to their heart, while murky, dark energy exits their body through your left hand. Envision yourself as a conduit for the healing process, allowing the energy to transfer smoothly without attachment to your own aura.

Component 5: Smudging ritual
Light a bundle of selected herbs, such as white sage to purify, lavender to calm, and frankincense to elevate spiritual vibrations. **Gently waft the fragrant smoke over the person's body, starting at their head and moving downward. As you do this, recite the following affirmation**:

"By sacred smoke, I cleanse and heal,
Balance restored, negativity repealed."

Component 6: Closure and protection
Speak words of gratitude to the guiding spirits or deities, thanking them for their support and asking them to continue guarding the person's energy. **Close with this protective sealing chant**:

"Aura now pure, strengthened and bright,
A shield of love, a guardian of light,
Seal this protection, repel darkness' sway,
Wholeness and health, remain this way."

Extinguish the candle, and take a moment to ground and center yourself and the person before stepping out of the sacred space. Remind the individual to maintain their energy by engaging in self-care practices, such as grounding, shielding, and regular energy cleansing. Encourage them to learn from this experience, and to keep cultivating a healthy aura to enhance their overall well-being.
