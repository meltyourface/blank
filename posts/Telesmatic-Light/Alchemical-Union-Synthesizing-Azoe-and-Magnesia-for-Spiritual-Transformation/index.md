To completely address this knowledge challenge, we must first provide a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts, processes and underlying principles involved in synthesizing Ázoe and Magnesia, in relation to the seven classical planets, the Telesmatic Light, and the preservation of equilibrium in one's consciousness.

Key Concepts:

1. **Ázoe and Magnesia**: These are esoteric substances that represent the primordial force and the spiritual essence of life in alchemical tradition and occult philosophy. In this context, Ázoe represents the volatile spirit, and Magnesia stands for the fixed soul. Their synthesis denotes the process of uniting both aspects to attain spiritual and energetic harmony, which aids in the actualization of higher consciousness.

2. **Seven Classical Planets**: In astrological and esoteric teachings, the classical planets - the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn - correspond to specific energies, forces, and archetypal principles that influence human life and consciousness.

3. **Telesmatic Light**: This term refers to divine light or spiritual illumination, encompassing an individual's connection to higher realms, spiritual knowledge, and inner wisdom. Attuning to the Telesmatic Light is seen as the ultimate goal of esoteric practices, leading to wisdom, enlightenment, and spiritual transformation.

4. **Consciousness Equilibrium**: This refers to the balanced state of one's inner mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects, allowing the person to maintain stability, well-being, and holistic growth as they undertake the processes implied in this challenge.

Step-by-step process to synthesize Ázoe and Magnesia in relation to the seven classical planets while attuning to the Telesmatic Light and preserving equilibrium:

1. **Study the Correspondences and Symbolism**: Begin by understanding the symbology, characteristics, and mutual relationships of the seven classical planets. Learn about their associations with the elements, metals, deities, and other symbolic representations, gaining insight into the energies they embody.

2. **Meditate on Each Planet**: Establish a deep connection with the individual energies of each planet through regular meditation and visualization practices. Focus on drawing their unique qualities and strengths within and integrating them into your psyche.

3. **Embrace the Principles of Alchemy**: Familiarize yourself with the foundational principles of alchemy, incorporating the ideas of transformation, transmutation, and the unity of opposites. This knowledge helps in approaching the synthesis of Ázoe and Magnesia from a place of understanding and purpose.

4. **Balance the Inner Planetary Energies**: Work on balancing the influences of the planetary energies within yourself. This involves self-reflection, introspection, and the cultivation of virtues that correspond to each of the seven planets to create an internal equilibrium.

5. **Synthesize Ázoe and Magnesia**: Utilize ritual and meditation to unite the energetic principles of Ázoe and Magnesia within your being, symbolically representing the union of spirit and soul. This synthesis initiates the attunement process to the Telesmatic Light.

6. **Maintain Consciousness Equilibrium**: Throughout the endeavor, continuously self-assess and engage in practices that preserve the balance in your emotional, mental, and spiritual life. This may include mindfulness, shadow work, energy healing, and other holistic modalities.

7. **Progressively Attune to Telesmatic Light**: As the merging of Ázoe and Magnesia progresses, and inner equilibrium is maintained, you will experience an increasing affinity for the Telesmatic Light. Continue your esoteric studies, meditations, and practices, cultivating the divine light within yourself and seeking greater spiritual wisdom.

In conclusion, the initiation process of synthesizing Ázoe and Magnesia, in relation to the seven classical planets, requires a methodical, reflective, and dedicated approach. By studying the correspondences and principles associated with these concepts, engaging in meditation and visualization, creating balance within the psyche, and utilizing esoteric practices that facilitate the uniting of spirit and soul, one can successfully attune to the Telesmatic Light while preserving the equilibrium within their consciousness.
