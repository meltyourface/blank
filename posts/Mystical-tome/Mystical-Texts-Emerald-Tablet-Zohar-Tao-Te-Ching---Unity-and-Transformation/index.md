To answer this knowledge challenge, we will delve into three distinct mystical tomes - The Emerald Tablet (Hermeticism), The Zohar (Kabbalah), and the Tao Te Ching (Taoism). We will identify and compare their key principles and influences, highlight their interconnections and distinguishing features, and contemplate their impact on the evolution of initiatory practices and spiritual awakening.

1. The Emerald Tablet (Hermeticism): The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Table, is a compact and cryptic Hermetic text believed to be written by Hermes Trismegistus, or "Hermes, thrice-great", who is an amalgamation of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. This ancient text discusses the art of alchemy and the philosophy of "As above, so below." The key principles found in the Emerald Tablet include the interconnectivity of the universe, the law of correspondence, and the process of spiritual and physical transformation.

2. The Zohar (Kabbalah): The Zohar is a foundational work in the literature of Jewish mysticism, known as Kabbalah. Attributed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, the Zohar is a collection of mystical commentaries on the Torah and elaborates on concepts such as the Tree of Life, a diagrammatic representation of the ten fundamental emanations (Sefirot) of the divine. The Zohar emphasizes the importance of cosmic harmony, divine emanations, and the process of returning to the divine source.

3. The Tao Te Ching (Taoism): The Tao Te Ching is a fundamental text of philosophical Taoism, traditionally attributed to Lao Tzu, an ancient Chinese philosopher. It consists of 81 poetic chapters providing wisdom and guidance on how to live one's life, offering insights on harmonious living, cultivating humility, and seeking balance. The central tenet of the Tao Te Ching is the concept of the Tao or "The Way," which represents the inherent nature of the universe.

Interconnections and Distinguishing Features:

- Interconnections: All three texts emphasize the interconnectedness and unity of the universe. Each tradition promotes the idea of balance and harmony, with Hermeticism discussing the principle of correspondence, Kabbalah speaking of cosmic harmony, and Taoism focusing on harmony with the natural world.
  
- Distinguishing Features: While each text explores profound spiritual and philosophical concepts, they stem from distinct cultural and temporal contexts. The Emerald Tablet has a focus on alchemy and transformation, while The Zohar delves into the symbolic cosmology of Kabbalah through the emanations of the divine. The Tao Te Ching offers a more philosophical and poetic approach to understanding the natural world and the unseen forces that govern it.

Impact on Initiatory Practices and Spiritual Awakening:

The three mystical tomes have profoundly influenced the spiritual and philosophical pursuits of individuals and communities throughout history. They have served as the foundation for countless esoteric orders, mystical societies, and religious movements, shaping the way initiates approach their spiritual path and develop their understanding of the mysteries of existence.

In conclusion, The Emerald Tablet, The Zohar, and the Tao Te Ching stand as three significant mystical tomes across distinct esoteric traditions. Their key themes include the interconnectedness of the universe, balance and harmony, and the journey towards spiritual awakening. By highlighting their interconnections and distinguishing features, we can better comprehend their profound impacts on initiatory practices and the evolution of spirituality throughout history.
