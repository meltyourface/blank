excerpt: Compose a unique incantation by reinterpreting a renowned English folk rhyme, specifically in the context of traditional English witchcraft, to be employed as a mystic chant during the observance of Beltane festivities. Enrich the charm by embedding subtle layers of esoteric symbolism, harnessing the energies of the natural elements, and alluding to the revered deities associated with this sacred sabbat in the witches' calendar.

By the light of the Beltane moon,
To the rhythm of the Green Man's tune,
As a bonfire roars and flame jumps high,
We summon ancient forces from the sky:

"Baa, baa! Cast a spell,
The wise Old Mother knows thee well.
Weave the elements with bright intent,
Plant the seeds for the earth to cement."

In the earth arise new beginnings,
As the Horned One's power is now spinning,
Sweet Freyja and Herne bestow your grace,
Upon this sacred witches' space:

"Twist of wind and howling gale,
Hats and cats and wagging tails.
As Samhain's end is far and near,
By Beltane's warmth, the blossoms appear."

From beneath the ground springs seed,
Through air and fire bring life to breed,
With water's rush, all streams do sprout,
The elements in dance do twist about:

"Starling's flight and magpie's gleam,
Each of four directions stream.
North and south, and east and west,
By the ancient gods, we're truly blessed."

Air, fire, water, and earth intertwined,
The spirit's essence, we do invite,
Chanting softly around the blaze,
To bless new life, the Beltane praise:

"Baa, baa! Now we ascension,
Completing our witches' mission.
To the gods and goddesses of old,
We dedicate this invocation bold."

Through the whisper of the leaves,
By the charm of this age-old belief,
Around the Beltane fire, we celebrate,
Together weaving our fates and fate.
