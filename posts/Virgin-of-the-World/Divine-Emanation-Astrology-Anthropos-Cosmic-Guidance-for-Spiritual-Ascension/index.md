To answer this complex and challenging question, let's first break down the concepts mentioned – divine emanation, astrological influences, and the Hermetic understanding of the Anthropos – before synthesizing them and exploring their implications for human evolution and spiritual ascension.

**Divine Emanation**

Divine emanation, within the context of the Virgin of the World and Hermetic philosophy, refers to the idea that all things in the universe, including matter and energy, are emanations or expressions of an infinite divine source or intelligence (often called "The All" or "The One"). This source continually emanates its essence or spirit into the created world, giving rise to the different planes of existence and all living beings. Divine emanation is closely related to the concept of the Great Chain of Being, which posits a hierarchical structure to the cosmos, with different levels of spiritual and material complexity.

**Astrological Influences**

Astrological influences, in Hermetic teachings and the Virgin of the World, relate to the belief that celestial bodies (such as stars and planets) affect and guide the lives of individuals and humanity as a whole. By examining the positions and movements of these celestial bodies, it's believed that astrologers can uncover hidden knowledge about an individual's destiny, personality, and the workings of the universe. Astrological influences are considered critical factors in the formation and progression of an individual's character and life path. They are also seen as instruments through which the divine influence manifests itself on our plane of reality.

**Hermetic Anthropos**

The Hermetic understanding of the Anthropos, within the context of the Virgin of the World, is a notion of humans as microcosms of the universe. Human beings, as Anthropos, are believed to reflect the structure and nature of the cosmos within themselves. As above, so below – this concept forms the foundation of Hermetic philosophy. Humans possess a twofold nature – spiritual and material – that reflects the cosmic duality of spirit and matter within the wider universe. The Anthropos is considered capable of attaining a profound, divine state of understanding and existence – in effect, transcending our current limitations and realizing our true spiritual potential.

**Synthesis and Implications**

When we synthesize these three concepts – divine emanation, astrological influences, and the Hermetic understanding of the Anthropos – we uncover their deeper implications for the evolution and spiritual ascension of the human being.

Divine emanation provides the essential backdrop for understanding the spiritual aspects of our existence. It implies that our true origin and ultimate destination lie within the realm of the divine. As we evolve and ascend spiritually, we move closer to the One – the divine essence that permeates all things. By understanding ourselves as emanations and expressions of this divine source, we recognize our inherent potential for spiritual growth and transformation.

Astrological influences, operating within this divine framework, serve as catalysts and signposts for our personal and collective evolution. As we become more aware of these influences and learn to work with them, we can more effectively navigate our lives and foster our spiritual growth. Astrology, as a tool for self-discovery and understanding the greater cosmic scheme, enables us to better align ourselves with our spiritual path and purpose.

Lastly, the Hermetic vision of the Anthropos forms a pathway for human beings to actualize their full potential as both material and spiritual beings. As we engage with the broader cosmic realities and the divine emanations that shape our existence, we gradually awaken our latent spiritual faculties and capabilities. This process of awakening, evolution, and ascension ultimately leads us toward greater understanding, unity, and harmony with both our inner and outer worlds.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the interplay between divine emanation, astrological influences, and the Hermetic Anthropos within the Virgin of the World teachings unveils a rich and multifaceted understanding of human existence and potential. The deep-seated interconnections between these principles suggest that our spiritual ascent is guided, informed, and supported by cosmic forces, celestial entities, and hidden wisdom that continuously reveals itself as we evolve. By understanding and embracing the complex synthesis of these principles, we can unlock profound insights into our nature and destiny, helping us to navigate our paths toward spiritual growth and self-realization.
