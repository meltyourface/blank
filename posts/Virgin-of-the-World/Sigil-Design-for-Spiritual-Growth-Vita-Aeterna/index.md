The sigil I have designed is called "Vita Aeterna," which represents the eternal life and the sacred connection with the divine. The sigil itself is composed of several key symbols and elements, each with its own significance, intricately woven together to form a harmonious and powerful design. The sigil is meant to channel energies that connect the bearer's soul with the eternal existence of the universe, reaching a heightened state of spiritual awareness and enlightenment.

1. The central part of the sigil features a spiraling vortex, known as the "Axis Mundi." This spiral represents the cosmic axis that unites the spiritual, celestial, and terrestrial realms. As the heart of the sigil, it signifies the need to find balance, stability, and the celestial connection in our eternal souls.

2. Surrounded by the Axis Mundi are four main symbols, representing the elements of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. These interconnected elements symbolize the harmonious and interconnected aspects of the Virgin of the World and the universe at large. Each element governs a different aspect of life and serves as a reminder of the importance of balance and interdependence.

   - Air: A rising bird embodies the ideals of freedom, transcendence, and spiritual ascension.
   - Fire: A flaming triangle signifies transformation, passion, and the burning desire for wisdom and understanding.
   - Water: A chalice containing cascading water illustrates the healing flow of emotions and the cleansing effect that inner peace brings to the soul.
   - Earth: A pentacle rooted in the ground signifies stability, enduring strength, and the grounding energies of the Earth.

3. Encircling the sigil's inner elements is a serpent known as the "Ouroboros," representing the cyclical nature of life, eternity, and the continuous process of spiritual growth and rebirth. This symbolizes the ever-changing nature of the universe and the eternal pursuit of wisdom and understanding.

4. The outer rim of the sigil is composed of twelve interwoven rays of light, symbolizing the twelve signs of the zodiac. These celestial forces connect the individual to the greater cosmos, signifying the deep bonds of unity that link each of our souls to the formation, interconnected, and eternal aspects of the universe.

5. Finally, an encompassing circle represents the interconnection and unity of the cosmos in the sacred principles within the Virgin of the World. It serves as a reminder of the eternal nature of existence and the importance of harmony, wholeness, and infinity â€“ all encapsulated within this one carefully-crafted symbol.

The combination of these intricate elements imbues the "Vita Aeterna" sigil with the enigmatic and powerful resonance aligned with the sacred principles of the Virgin of the World. By focusing one's energy and intention upon this sigil, its bearer is empowered to tap into the eternal forces of the universe, achieving a greater level of spiritual growth, cosmic connection, and boundless wisdom guided by the underlying cosmology in their existence.
