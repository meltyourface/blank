To create a comprehensive astrological map connecting celestial planets to the corresponding Greco-Egyptian underworld deities, we will establish correspondences between the seven classical planets and the key underworld deities. **The seven classical planets are**: the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn.

1. **Sun**: Helios is the Titan god of the sun in Greek mythology. In the Greco-Egyptian context, he is associated with Ra, the Egyptian sun god. They both represent the life force, power, and authority. Since the sun is the center of our solar system, it provides a fitting correspondence with these powerful deities.

2. **Moon**: Selene, the Greek goddess of the moon, is associated with the Egyptian moon goddess, Isis. They embody femininity, magic, intuition, and renewal. As the moon regulates the tides and influences our emotions, it is appropriate to correlate it with these deities of mystery and transformation.

3. **Mars**: Ares, the Greek god of war, corresponds with the Egyptian god Set, the deity of chaos and disorder. As Mars is known for its aggressive and assertive energy, it pairs well with these deities, representing conflict, competition, and disruption.

4. **Mercury**: Hermes, the Greek messenger of the gods, is associated with Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom and knowledge. As the planet Mercury governs communication, intellect, and travel, it is naturally linked to these deities who facilitate knowledge exchange and movement within the underworld.

5. **Jupiter**: Hades, the Greek king of the underworld, corresponds with Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife and resurrection. The planet Jupiter, representing expansion and abundance, aligns well with these deities who oversee the souls' journey and the cycles of rebirth.

6. **Venus**: Persephone, the Greek goddess of the underworld and the vegetation cycle, can be linked to Hathor, the Egyptian goddess of love and fertility. The planet Venus, symbolizing love, beauty, and harmony, resonates with these deities who govern fertility, transformation, and renewal.

7. **Saturn**: Chronos, the Greek god of time, corresponds with Anubis, the Egyptian god of embalming and the protector of the dead. The planet Saturn is associated with discipline, responsibility, and karma, mirroring these deities who oversee the passage of time and the weighing of souls upon death.

The correlation between these planets and deities allows us to analyze the influence of specific astrological events on the interplay between the underworld spirits and the mortal realm.

For instance, when Mars is in retrograde, it could signify a period of increased instability and discord, as the energies of Ares and Set are hindered, leading to potential chaos and conflict in the mortal world. Similarly, a conjunction of Venus and Jupiter might indicate a time of harmony in fertility, love, and abundance, as Persephone's and Hathor's energies align with Hades' and Osiris' influences on the afterlife and renewal.

By observing these astrological events and their corresponding deities, we can gain meaningful insights into significant moments when Greco-Egyptian underworld energies may profoundly influence the mortal realm. Through this understanding, we can better navigate these periods and harmonize our lives with the cosmic interplay of the gods and the celestial bodies.
