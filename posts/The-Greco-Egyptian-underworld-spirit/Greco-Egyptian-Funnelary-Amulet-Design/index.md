To craft a meticulous funerary amulet that draws upon the fusion of Greco-Egyptian mythos, it's essential to incorporate a harmonious blend of symbolic elements representing both cultures. Here, we envision a delicately crafted amulet that offers profound spiritual protection for the soul traversing the dangerous realms of Duat and the Elysian Fields:

**Shape**: The amulet is shaped like a winged scarab, a potent symbol of rebirth and resurrection in ancient Egyptian beliefs. At the center of the scarab, there's an encompassing circle which represents Hades's Helm of Darkness – an artifact that renders its wearer invisible, ensuring that they remain undetected by potential dangers in the afterlife.

**Materials**: The amulet is crafted primarily from lapis lazuli, a deep blue semi-precious stone that was highly revered by both the Greeks and Egyptians. This precious material represents the night sky, a pathway through which the spirit ascends to the afterlife. In addition, the amulet is adorned with gold, a metal considered to be sacred in both cultures. Gold represents the eternal glow of the divine and signifies spiritual protection.

**Symbols**:
1. **The Eye of Horus**: A powerful symbol of protection and good health in the Egyptian mythos, the Eye of Horus is engraved on the wings of the scarab. This symbol invokes the divine protection of Horus, son of Osiris, and guides the spirit through the afterlife.

2. **Cerberus**: The three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the Greek underworld is depicted at the bottom of the amulet. Cerberus serves as a sentinel, ensuring the safety of the soul and preventing malevolent forces from entering the protected realm.

3. **Ankh**: To reinforce the message of eternal life, a beautifully crafted ankh rests within the circle representing Hades's Helm of Darkness. The ankh is an ancient Egyptian symbol that is believed to bestow immortality on the wearer.

4. **Greek Key Motif (Meander)**: The amulet's border is etched with the meandering Greek key motif, which represents the eternal flow of life and the interconnected nature of existence. This pattern signifies the soul's journey and the eternal nature of the cosmos.

Divine Inscriptions: The amulet is inscribed with relevant sacred texts and incantations that invoke the powers of the Greco-Egyptian underworld deities. **Some of these inscriptions include**:

1. **The Negative Confession**: Excerpts from the ancient Egyptian text, which lists declarations of innocence necessary for the soul to achieve immortality, are engraved in hieroglyphics around the amulet.

2. **Orphic Hymns**: Additionally, lines from the Greek 'Orphic Hymns' – mystical texts dedicated to the gods and goddesses of the underworld, such as Hades and Persephone – are inscribed across the surface of the amulet in ancient Greek.

By incorporating these potent elements, symbols, and inscriptions, the funerary amulet we have envisioned invokes the protective prowess of the Greco-Egyptian underworld deities, ensuring the safe passage of the soul through the mystical realms of Duat and the Elysian Fields. The amulet serves as a powerful talisman for those embarking on their eternal journey, providing solace and guidance throughout their spiritual odyssey.
