Hecate and Anubis, though originating from separate cultures and mythological traditions, share several commonalities in their roles and attributes within the frameworks of the Greco-Egyptian underworld. As such, it is essential to explore their guiding, protective, and transformative functions along with the ways in which their respective mythologies have interacted to influence the development of Greco-Egyptian occult practices, theosophical conceptions of the afterlife, and baseline cultural assumptions in both traditions.

Hecate is a goddess whose roots are found in ancient Greek mythology. She is often referred to as the goddess of witchcraft, magic, and the night, embodying a triform aspect embodying the maiden, mother, and crone. Within the context of the Greco-Egyptian underworld, Hecate is the psychopomp, responsible for guiding and protecting souls as they journey through the complex realm of the afterlife. Additionally, she is considered the goddess of crossroads and thresholds, signifying transformation and liminality. Hecate's transformative power serves both as a metaphor for the acceptance of death and a symbol of an individual's internal alchemical process.

On the other hand, Anubis, the Egyptian god of the underworld, is most commonly associated with embalming and funerary rites and is depicted as a man with the head of a jackal. Anubis holds a significant role in the protection and guidance of the deceased on their journey throughDuat, the Egyptian underworld. As the guardian of the gates, he ensures that only deserving souls pass and receive a proper burial. Anubis is also a psychopomp and oversees the Weighing of the Heart ceremony, where the heart of the deceased is weighed against the feather of Ma'at. If the heart is lighter than the feather, it signifies a life lived in harmony and balance, allowing the soul to pass into the afterlife. This weighing process underscores Anubis's transformative function, which is more about moral and spiritual judgment than the actual transformation.

The synthesis of Hecate's and Anubis's respective roles in the Greco-Egyptian underworld largely originates from the period of Hellenistic Egypt, where the sharing of ideas and cultural blending took place. During this era, the Egyptian and Greek pantheons merged, with deities such as Hecate and Anubis assimilating cult followings and elements from each other. As such, the interactions of their mythologies greatly influenced the development of esoteric, occult beliefs, and practices in ancient times.

The guiding, protective, and transformative attributes of both Hecate and Anubis have contributed significantly to the foundation of the Greco-Egyptian afterlife theosophy, which heavily emphasizes the necessity of proper burial rites, the purification of the soul, and the importance of moral virtues. Moreover, their shared role as psychopomps and protectors of the dead highlights the importance placed on preparing and guiding souls for the afterlife journey.

In the realm of occult practices, the synthesis of Hecate's and Anubis's mythologies has led to a more comprehensive understanding of the spiritual components involved in death and rebirth. As mediating figures with the power to navigate and shape experiences in the underworld, practitioners seek their influence and protection during rituals, both to ensure success and access deeper layers of knowledge and transformation. Consequently, their respective attributes have become crucial in the development of ceremonial rites, invocations, and talismanic magic.

To summarize, the roles and attributes of Hecate and Anubis within the Greco-Egyptian underworld context are multifaceted and overlapping, with both deities serving as psychopomps and protectors of the deceased. Their transformative functions differ in their approach, with Hecate embodying more symbolic and internal transformation, while Anubis exemplifies moral and spiritual judgment. Through the synthesis and interplay of their mythologies during the Hellenistic period, the development of Greco-Egyptian occult practices and theosophical conceptions of the afterlife is significantly enriched by their guiding, protective, and transformative attributes.
