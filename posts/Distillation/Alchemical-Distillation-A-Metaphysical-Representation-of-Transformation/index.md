Answer:

To elucidate the connection between the Hermetic principle "Solve et Coagula" and the process of distillation in alchemical transformation, we must first delve into the meaning and context of each component.

"Solve et Coagula" is a Latin maxim, frequently encountered in alchemical and Hermetic literature, which translates to "Dissolve and Coagulate." This concept signifies breaking down existing matter or established boundaries and structures, and subsequently synthesizing them into a more refined or unified whole. In the context of the Hermetic tradition, "Solve et Coagula" embodies the theological principle that spiritual growth stems from the continuous process of breaking apart and reconstituting one's self, pushing the practitioner toward an ever-evolving state of enlightenment.

Distillation, on the other hand, is a practical technique in alchemy that entails separating and purifying constituent substances through a succession of heating, vaporization, and condensation processes. This method is a physical representation of the aforementioned "Solve et Coagula" principle in that it seeks to refine and transform available materials (i.e., the philosopher's stone or the elixir of life) into an exalted or enlightened state.

Now, let's explore the metaphysical correspondences between the elements involved in distillation and their influence on an individual's spiritual growth.

Alchemy is intrinsically tied to the four classical elements: earth, water, air, and fire. These elements possess both literal and symbolic functions in alchemical operations, representing essential stages of transformation that align with the individual's spiritual journey.

1. Earth: In the alchemical process, 'earth' represents the initial solid state of matter—the prima materia or raw material to be transformed. Metaphysically, it symbolizes grounding and establishing a firm foundation, correlating with the physical, material aspect of our existence.
 
2. Water: Water plays a vital role in dissolving or purifying substances. Metaphysically, it corresponds to emotions, intuition, and the subconscious mind. In the context of spiritual growth, it signifies the process of acknowledging and confronting deep-rooted emotions or fears.

3. Air: Alchemically, air is the element responsible for vaporization, the phase during which the substance dissociates from its fixed form. Metaphysically, air correlates with thoughts, mental constructs, and communication. In the process of spiritual transformation, this marks the stage of detachment from pre-existing beliefs or paradigms, prompting intellectual evolution.

4. Fire: In distillation, fire ignites the transformation processes of dissolution and vaporization. As a metaphysical correspondence, fire represents willpower, energy, and transmutation. Engaging fire in spiritual growth involves harnessing personal power to overcome challenges, instigate positive change and rebirth, and create the necessary energy for transformation.

Hence, alchemical distillation not only epitomizes the Hermetic principle of "Solve et Coagula" in its physical processes, but also its metaphysical symbolism. The elements involved in the distillation process mirror stages of personal and spiritual development in a manner consistent with the dissolution and recombination inherent in "Solve et Coagula."

In summation, the connection between "Solve et Coagula" and the process of distillation lies in their shared pursuit of refinement and transformation. This elucidation highlights the intrinsic nature of both concepts, which promote the idea that continuous cycles of breaking down and reconstituting individual components leads to spiritual growth. By examining the metaphysical correspondences of the elements involved in alchemical distillation, we gain deeper insight into how these processes resonate with the individual’s spiritual journey, ultimately culminating in an enriched understanding of the interconnectedness between the esoteric, the physical, and human spirituality.
