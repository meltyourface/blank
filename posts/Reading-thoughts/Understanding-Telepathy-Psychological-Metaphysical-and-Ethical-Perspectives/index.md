The knowledge challenge posed here essentially asks us to dive deep into the complex world of telepathy and the many factors that weave together to bring this esoteric phenomenon to life. We will discuss the psychological, metaphysical, and ethical aspects of telepathy and how a deep understanding of the collective unconscious, symbology, and empathy can guide our journey into another's thoughts while ensuring we respect their boundaries and personal sovereignty. 

To begin, let us first explore the three main aspects of telepathy that form the basis of our inquiry:

1. Psychological aspects: Telepathy, by definition, involves a non-physical and often unconscious communication between beings. This communication is inherently rooted in human psychology as both the sender and receiver draw upon their mental and emotional faculties to encode, transmit, and decipher information.

2. Metaphysical aspects: The metaphysical dimension of telepathy refers to the reality that transcends our immediate sensory experience. It acknowledges the existence of subtle energy fields and ethereal planes of existence, which play an essential role in the explanation and execution of telepathic experiences.

3. Ethical aspects: Telepathy, as the art of gaining access to another's thoughts and emotions, raises critical questions about privacy, consent, and the use of personal information. Balancing curiosity and exploration with respect and integrity is crucial to ensure that the ethical elements of telepathy are appropriately addressed.

Now that we have a firm grasp on the main components of telepathy, let's delve into the intricacies of the collective unconscious, symbology, and empathy to see how they facilitate the process of telepathy while ensuring the preservation of personal sovereignty and sacred boundaries.

**Collective unconscious**: Coined by Carl Jung, the "collective unconscious" refers to the shared unconscious reservoir of memories, instincts, and experiences that are common to all human beings. This repository of archetypes and symbols serves as the foundation for human understanding and communication. By tapping into the collective unconscious, the telepathic adept can access the symbolic language necessary to convey their thoughts and emotions efficiently and effectively to another individual, respecting their personal sovereignty by communicating on a non-intrusive, intuitively understood level.

**Symbology**: Symbology deals with the study and interpretation of symbols, which are vital communicative tools in the realm of telepathy. They provide a universal means of expressing complex concepts and emotions across different planes of existence without requiring direct, invasive access to an individual's personal thoughts. Symbols may appear in various forms, such as mental images, auditory sensations, or emotional impressions. The skilled telepathic adept is one who can accurately decipher the contextual meaning behind the symbolic language, thus allowing them to navigate the intricate tapestry of another's thoughts while maintaining boundaries and preventing unwarranted intrusion.

**Empathy**: Finally, empathy acts as the bridge between the psychological and metaphysical components of telepathy. Empathy allows the telepathic adept to resonate with another's emotions and mental states fully, creating rapport and trust. This connection helps the adept to fine-tune their telepathic abilities, ensuring they can approach the other's thoughts with understanding and sensitivity, without disrupting their personal sovereignty or imposing upon their sacred boundaries.

In summary, the multifaceted world of telepathy revolves around the intricate interplay of psychological, metaphysical, and ethical aspects. By cultivating a profound understanding of the collective unconscious, symbology, and empathy, the telepathic adept can venture into the realm of another's thoughts with awareness, respect, and discretion, upholding personal sovereignty and sacred boundaries as they traverse the subtle dimensions of human consciousness.
