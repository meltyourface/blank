The Adage: "As within, so without; as above, so below."

The adage "As within, so without; as above, so below" encapsulates the inherent principles of occultism and esotericism in relation to Adagia by emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things, the dual nature of reality, and the idea that the outer world is a reflection of the inner world. This all-encompassing adage provides an allegorical guide to revealing access to an understanding of the unseen aspects of reality, while simultaneously highlighting the importance of the dual nature of the external world and the inner self.

The phrase "As within, so without" signifies that the inner state of an individual, their thoughts, emotions, and beliefs, are reflected in their external world. This aligns with the esoteric and occult principles of the Adagia that teach that personal growth and understanding of self is vital to understanding the world around us. Conversely, "As above, so below" emphasizes that the macrocosm, or the universe, is mirrored in the microcosm, the individual. This notion originates in the Hermetic tradition and is a fundamental principle in esoteric teachings, which seek to understand the divine mysteries of life and the cosmos.

By utilizing this adage as an allegorical guide, one can focus on understanding the unseen aspects of reality, not just looking externally but by delving inward into the self. This understanding arises when an individual comprehends that by cultivating inner harmony and balance, they can affect their external circumstances and perceive the deeper, often hidden, interconnectedness of all things.

To decipher the dual nature of reality, one must consider the importance of polarity and duality as highlighted in this adage. In the external world, polarity is exemplified in the natural dualities such as male and female, light and dark, and positive and negative forces. This duality extends to the inner self, where emotions and thoughts contain both light and darkness.

By grasping that the dual nature of the world and the self are complementary and necessary, a student of occult and esoteric knowledge can begin to recognize the benefits and interdependence of these polarities. This recognition deepens one's understanding of the fabric of reality and can lead to a profound appreciation for the unfolding of universal forces in one's life.

In conclusion, the all-encompassing adage "As within, so without; as above, so below" integrates the principles of occultism, esotericism, and Adagia into a single, concise expression by reflecting the interconnectedness and dual nature of reality. By using this adage as an allegorical guide, an individual can begin a transformative journey to uncover the unseen aspects of reality, while simultaneously developing a deeper understanding of the self and the external world. The key themes of this adage include the exploration of duality in both the inner self and the outer world, the universality of the macrocosm-microcosm relationship, and the essential need for personal growth and understanding in accessing a more profound appreciation of the unseen aspects of existence.
