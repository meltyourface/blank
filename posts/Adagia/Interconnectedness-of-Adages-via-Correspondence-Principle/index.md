2. **The principle of correspondence**

The principle of correspondence best illustrates the interconnectedness and reliance of multiple branching aspects and contexts within a single adage. This concept originates from the Hermetic tradition, specifically the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, an essential text in Western esotericism. This principle states that the microcosm reflects the macrocosm, and vice versa, emphasizing the idea that all parts of reality are interconnected and mirror each other.

Applying the principle of correspondence to the study of Adagia, we can deduce that an adage's meaning and its connection to other contexts and aspects are all related, as they emerge from a universal order underlying reality. For instance, a single adage may hold significance in various areas, such as philosophy, religion, and science, each displaying a different aspect of the whole.

Let's briefly review the other options:

1. As above, so below: Although this concept is related to the principle of correspondence, it does not specifically address the multiple branching aspects and contexts in a single adage. Instead, it describes the relationship between the macrocosm and the microcosm, which is a broader perspective on the interconnectedness of all things.

3. **The law of three**: This principle, primarily rooted in Wicca and other Neopagan religions, states that whatever energy or actions a person puts out into the world will be returned to them threefold. While an intriguing concept, it does not directly address the interconnectedness and reliance of multiple aspects and contexts within a single adage.

4. **The theorem of sympathetic magic**: This concept originates from the field of anthropology, describing the belief that objects that share certain characteristics can influence each other through their shared properties. While sympathetic magic does imply a connection between seemingly separate things, it does not address the intricacies of a single adage and its connection to various contexts and interpretations.

In conclusion, the principle of correspondence is the best answer to the question, as it directly addresses the interconnectedness and reliance of multiple branching aspects and contexts within a single adage. It is a fundamental concept in the study of Adagia and the occult, underscoring the notion that everything in reality is linked and reflects a universal order.
