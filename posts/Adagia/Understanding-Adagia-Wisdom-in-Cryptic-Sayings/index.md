The correct answer is: Systematic and philosophical teachings encoded in the form of short, memorable sayings.

Adagia, originating from the Latin word "adagium," is a collection of adages or maxims that contain universal truths, moral teachings, or traditional wisdoms. They have been widely used throughout history in various cultures and practices, including esoteric and occult studies. In the context of these fields, Adagia takes on a more in-depth role, encompassing systematic and philosophical teachings encoded in short, memorable sayings. 

These adages are designed to encapsulate complex subjects into easy-to-remember phrases or sentences, enabling a practitioner to quickly recall and apply the knowledge embedded within the adage. With deeper contemplation and proper understanding of their hidden meanings, scholars and practitioners of the occult or esoteric arts can unlock the wisdom and concepts encoded into these aphorisms.

The rationale behind interpreting Adagia as systematic and philosophical teachings is based on how various occult and esoteric traditions use these adages. Many traditions, such as alchemy, Kabbalah, and Hermeticism, rely on allegory, symbolism, and layers of meaning in their teachings. Adagia serves as a compact, coded form for transmitting these teachings. 

For instance, let's examine the famous Hermetic adage, "As above, so below." This saying represents the idea that there is a direct correlation between the macrocosm (the universe as a whole) and the microcosm (individual humans and nature). It encapsulates the concept that events or situations on one level of existence (i.e., the heavens) directly influence and mirror those on another level (i.e., the earthly realm). By understanding and contemplating this adage, one gains insight into the greater mysteries of existence and the interconnectedness of all things.

Another example is the adage "Know thyself." This aphorism is often attributed to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates and Pythagoras but is also connected to the esoteric study of the self and personal transformation. In the context of the occult and esoteric practices, knowing oneself has several layers of meaning. On one level, it encourages the practitioner to deepen their understanding of their own personality, behaviors, and beliefs. On a deeper level, it encompasses the ongoing pursuit of self-discovery, spiritual growth, and enlightenment through different methods of study, meditation, and introspection. 

In conclusion, Adagia serves as a medium to transmit esoteric and occult teachings in a condensed and often cryptic form. The complex subjects and concepts encoded within these memorable sayings can be unlocked through careful contemplation and deeper understanding. Rather than being a mere collection of proverbs, these adages hold philosophical and teaching values intrinsic to the occult and esoteric practices and are used to convey wisdom and universal principles that have endured throughout the ages.
