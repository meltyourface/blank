description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Adagia, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Devise an arcane Adagian incantation by transmutating a time-honored aphorism, thereby imbuing it with comedic elements and unexpected wit. To ensure precision and alignment with the esoteric domain, infuse references to occult symbolism, mystical characters, or otherworldly phenomena. For added complexity, cast a spell of elaborate wordplay, employing puns or subtle linguistic sorcery that will bewitch the minds of those who dare to decipher the enchanted adage.

Upon the twilight's astral plane, where mystic follies lay untamed,
The Hermit chuckled at his cards, and whispered soft a phrase to charm:
As above, so below, yet wrapped in cosmic enigma's glow.
A wondrous wordplay woven, to mystify and keep harm at bay.

“Hark!” he laughed, “An arcane quip, as restless phantoms come and go:
To fly by night, or walk unseen, a former self you'll never show.
For when the Sphinx didst cackle once, and Merlin turned his staff to stone,
No cloak of darkness could ever hide that which the moon hath in jest shone.”

Then alchemical wit didst blend, with Metatron's Cube 'round the bend,
The Adagian incantation cast, and sorcerous laughter echoed last:
All that glistens is not gold, but of the Philosopher's Stone behold,
Transformed in jest, a play of words, the tale of a jokester never heard.

Beware the riddle, the laugh, the call, for hidden truths may jesters maul,
Yet from our wisdom, interlace, the puns, the charm, a cunning grace.

This spell of wordcraft binds, bemuses,
As the spirit of laughter peruses,
Enchanted adages rearrange,
To dance the humorous, the arcane, and strange.
