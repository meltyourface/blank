As we embark on the journey to deciphering the relationship between the ancient adage "As above, so below" and the Hermetic principles, it is essential to understand the foundational concepts and history of the Hermetic tradition. The Hermeticism is a philosophical and esoteric tradition based on the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a mysterious sage, and divine prophet, often seen as a synthesis of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.

At the core of these teachings are the Hermetic principles derived from the foundational texts of the Corpus Hermeticum, predominantly, the Kybalion. **The Kybalion contains seven principles**:

1. **The Principle of Mentalism**: This principle states that the universe is a mental construct, originating from one single divine source, the Universal Mind.
2. **The Principle of Correspondence**: This principle is directly related to the adage "As above, so below," symbolizing a relationship between macrocosm and microcosm, making a connection between the material and the spiritual realms.
3. **The Principle of Vibration**: It explains that everything in the universe, seen or unseen, is vibrating at different frequencies.
4. **The Principle of Polarity**: The idea that opposites are merely different expressions of the same fundamental nature, connected along a single continuum.
5. **The Principle of Rhythm**: The recurring cycles and patterns observed in nature, from day and night to the circle of life and death.
6. **The Principle of Cause and Effect**: The idea that events are connected through a chain of causality.
7. **The Principle of Gender**: This principle refers not to biological sex but to the existence of two energetic poles, masculine and feminine, found in various levels of creation.

To understand the relationship between "As above, so below" and Hermetic principles and their synthesis revealing the multidimensional nature of reality, let us delve into the realms of alchemy, astrology, and initiation rites.

Firstly, alchemy is a complex practice, full of symbolism and allegory. The adage "As above, so below" is fundamental to alchemy, where its ultimate goal is the union of earthly and divine realms through processes like transmutation from lead to gold or creating the Philosopher's Stone. **Alchemy highlights the first three principles**: Mentalism, Correspondence, and Vibration. For example, the process of transmutation showcases the mental projection of humans interacting with physical substances, creating an interconnected vibrational energy. Correspondence is reinforced by connecting the chemical processes occurring within alchemists' retorts with planetary, spiritual, and cosmic forces at play.

Secondly, astrology allows for a deeper exploration of the second Hermetic principle, the Principle of Correspondence. Astrology is based on the idea that macrocosmic events occurring in the celestial realm (the position of planets and stars) correspond to the microcosmic events in human life. By understanding celestial influences and alignments, astrologers decode the relationship between the individual and cosmic forces. Using astrological charts, we see how macrocosm plays a role in shaping individual destiny and how microcosm reflects the larger unseen forces at work in the universe.

Finally, in initiation rites, which are symbolic ceremonies marking the passage from one spiritual state to another, "As above, so below" finds a central role. Initiation rites aim to reintegrate the individual with the divine source and cosmic order, enabling the spiritual transformation of the initiate. By engaging with the process of being initiated, one is confronting the Principle of Mentalism, acknowledging the existence of a higher Universal Mind. Additionally, these spiritual practices and rituals incorporate principles of Rhythm and Cause and Effect as the participant undergoes inner transformations concretely affecting their outer reality. In essence, initiation rites underline the interconnectedness and correspondence of inner and outer worlds, human, and divine existence.

In conclusion, the adage "As above, so below" and the Hermetic principles reveal the multidimensional nature of reality by highlighting the interconnectedness and correspondence between the material and spiritual worlds. The realms of alchemy, astrology, and initiation rites showcase how these ideas are practiced and understood by humans in their quest for insight and transformation. By synthesizing the message of "As above, so below" within our lives, we can achieve greater spiritual growth and gain a deep-rooted understanding of the underlying forces governing our existence.
