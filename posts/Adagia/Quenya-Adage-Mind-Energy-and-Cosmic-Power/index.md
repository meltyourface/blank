Upon delving into the mystical realm of Adagia, I have selected a renowned adage imbued with esoteric wisdom:

"Where the mind goes, energy flows"

To translate this profound saying into the enchanting Elvish language, which is known as Quenya, we get:

"Ya mi cilme meneä, nóre nehteä."

In this translation:

- "Ya" means "where"
- "mi" means "in"
- "cilme" means "thought" or "mind"
- "meneä" means "goes" or "moves"
- "nóre" means "energy" or "power"
- "nehteä" means "flows" or "stream"

Breaking down the adage's occult meaning in the context of Quenya offers fascinating insights into both the creative and cultural nuances of this ancient Elvish language. In Quenya, the phrase suggests a powerful connection between the mind's thoughts and the movement of energy within the universe, echoing the esoteric belief in the interconnectedness of all things. This linkage emphasizes the innate power of both thought and energy to manifest outcomes in the world and further underscores the spiritual identity inherent to the Elvish language.

In Elvish culture, the concept of this adage carries even deeper significance. The Elves are known for their refined mastery of emotions and their deep wisdom, which proves essential in their continuous engagement with the elemental forces. Consequently, the adage serves as a valuable reminder for every Elf, whether they are a lore master or a simple child listening to tales of times long past, to actively cultivate mental and emotional discipline in order to harness their energies and translate them into masterful manifestations.

When the adage "Ya mi cilme meneä, nóre nehteä" is uttered in Elvish society, it offers both a practical prescription for the channeling and directing of energy and a profound meditation on the intimately woven fabric of thought and cosmic power. The wisdom encapsulated in this ancient saying serves as a guiding star for the Elves as they navigate the vast expanses of both the physical and the mystical realms.
