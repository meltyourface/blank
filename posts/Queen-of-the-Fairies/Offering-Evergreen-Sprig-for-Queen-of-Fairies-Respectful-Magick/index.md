The correct answer is: Offering an ethically and sustainably sourced evergreen sprig as a token of respect.

In the study of the esoteric and occult, various deities and entities are often invoked or petitioned for assistance in magickal workings. These beings usually have different preferences, associations, and energies, which practitioners should align with when seeking their help.

The Queen of the Fairies, sometimes referred to as Queen Mab or Titania, represents the sovereign power of the fairy realm. As a divine figure associated with nature and the elements, the Queen of the Fairies is traditionally honored with tokens and offerings that align with her energies and domain. 

In this context, the offering of an ethically and sustainably sourced evergreen sprig is the most appropriate way to connect with the Queen of the Fairies and seek her assistance. Evergreen plants are known for their ability to survive and thrive in various conditions, symbolizing enduring life, resilience, and a connection with the natural world. This makes an evergreen sprig a fitting offering for the Queen of the Fairies, who presides over nature and elemental forces.

While alignment with certain lunar phases can be important in many magickal workings, the Queen of the Fairies has not been specifically linked to any particular lunar phase. Similarly, utilizing enchanted talismans can help invoke various deities and entities, but it is not the primary method to gain the assistance of the queen. Likewise, demonstrating mastery over multiple traditional forms of divination may enhance one's connections with the mystical world, but it does not directly correlate to the Queen of the Fairies' influence or favor.

In conclusion, to gain the assistance of the Queen of the Fairies in magickal workings, practitioners should focus on offering an ethically and sustainably sourced evergreen sprig as a token of respect. This demonstrates the magician's understanding of the queen's nature and connection to the elemental forces, as well as their commitment to honoring and preserving the environment that she reigns over.
