The Gnostic Mass, or Liber XV, is a sacred ritual that employs intricate symbolism and various esoteric themes to create a powerful experience of divine union and spiritual awakening. It draws inspiration from various spiritual and mystical traditions, including ancient Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and Thelemic mysticism as brought forth by Aleister Crowley. One significant aspect of the Gnostic Mass is its incorporation of the Enochian language, a unique and enigmatic language used by many occultists in ceremonial magic.

The Enochian language was originally developed by the English occultist John Dee and his seer, Edward Kelley, in the late 16th century. It is said to be the language of angels and has been employed in various magical rituals and practices. In the context of the Gnostic Mass, Enochian is utilized to invoke angelic presences and tap into the deep reservoirs of spiritual power that permeate the ritual.

One such Enochian invocation found within the Gnostic Mass is the following:

"Ol zodameta luiahe od vaoan ol ahaiotas theli camliax, ol zodameta faosla balg az aziaziodir Luiahe zunron os vsaoag Pele tomazodii"

Translated into modern English, the invocation reads:

"Behold the splendor of God and the hosts of holy angels, behold the harmony of their creation, the hidden wisdom and the power that emanates from the divine realms and angelic presences all around. May this truth be made manifest through the vessel of our ceremony."

The encoded esoteric meanings behind this invocation can be broken down as follows:

1. "Ol zodameta luiahe od vaoan ol ahaiotas theli camliax": This phrase invokes the splendor of God and the presence of the angelic hosts. It highlights the importance of divine intervention and assistance within the context of the Gnostic Mass, setting the stage for the harmonious interplay between human practitioners and celestial beings.

2. "Ol zodameta faosla balg az aziaziodir Luiahe zunron os vsaoag": This segment of the invocation calls forth the invisible wisdom and power that emanates from the divine and the angelic realms. It suggests that within the Gnostic Mass, practitioners are not merely performing a ritual but are tapping into a deep and transcendent spiritual current.

3. "Pele tomazodii": This phrase serves as a petition for the truth to be made manifest through the physical vessel of the ceremony. It recognizes that the Mass is a physical, tangible expression of spiritual truths, and calls for the perfect synthesis of material and spiritual reality.

In summary, the chosen Enochian invocation within the Gnostic Mass serves to establish a connection between the participants and the divine realms, assisted by angelic presences. It hints at the spiritual power that can be harnessed through the proper performance of the Mass, and calls for the manifestation of profound truths in the material world.

The Enochian language, as well as other forms of ceremonial magic and esoteric symbolism, play crucial roles in the overall structure and impact of the Gnostic Mass. These elements serve to deepen the spiritual significance of the ritual and enhance the transformative experience it offers to practitioners. By examining the layers of symbolism, meaning, and history embedded in the Gnostic Mass, one can begin to uncover the profound power and potential of this revered ceremony.
