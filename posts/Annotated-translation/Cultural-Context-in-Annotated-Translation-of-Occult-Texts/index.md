Answer: Familiarity with cultural contexts, historical backgrounds, and corresponding elements of the source and target texts.

Explanation: While all of the listed factors play a role in the annotated translation of occult texts, the most crucial element is a deep understanding of the cultural contexts, historical backgrounds, and corresponding elements of the source and target texts. This is because occult texts are often deeply rooted in the specific cultures, traditions, and historical contexts of their time, and understanding these factors enables a translator to better grasp the symbolism and mystic language commonly employed in such works.

Proficiency in multiple languages is also important; however, it only serves as a foundation for understanding the text at the linguistic level. Annotated translation of esoteric texts requires not only linguistic knowledge but also an understanding of the enigmatic and symbolic meaning behind the words themselves.

Evolved spiritual insight and personal experience with occult practices indeed help in understanding the subject matter from the practitioner's point of view. However, this knowledge alone might not offer a complete understanding of the cultural and historical aspects influencing the text.

Objectivity is always useful when dealing with any translation work, as it prevents bias from clouding the translator's understanding. However, a purely objective approach might hinder the translator from grasping the deeper, symbolic meaning of the occult texts.

In conclusion, an accurate and comprehensive annotated translation of esoteric and occult texts requires a solid understanding of the cultural, historical, and symbolical aspects of the texts. This is not to downplay the importance of other factors such as linguistic proficiency, personal experience, and objectivity, but rather emphasizes the role that the cultural and historical context plays in decoding these ancient texts. Familiarity with the cultural context helps the translator identify and decipher the hidden meanings, symbols, and allegories which often permeate occult literature. This enables the translation to go beyond mere linguistic accuracy, rendering the esoteric nature of the texts accessible to a wider and more diverse audience.
