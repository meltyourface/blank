The influence of medieval Islamic astrology's annotated translations on the evolution and intricacy of Western magical practices is profound and far-reaching. As Islamic scholars translated the classical texts of Greek and Persian astrology into Arabic during the Golden Age of Islamic civilization, they added extensive annotations and new knowledge, developing intricate techniques and methods that would significantly reshape the practice of astrology. This process occurred primarily between the 8th and 12th centuries, laying the groundwork for the later transmission of astrological knowledge from the Islamic world to the developing Western magical tradition.

One of the most significant ways in which Arabic astrological manuscripts influenced Western spellcasting was through the introduction of new astrological concepts and techniques. For example, the development of the Arabic Parts—mathematical points based on the positions of the planets, the ascendant, and the midheaven—proved foundational in the Western astrological tradition, allowing for more precise predictions and a deeper understanding of individual charts. Similarly, the Arabic concept of the Decanates, or ten-degree divisions of the zodiacal signs, enriched the Western tradition by providing detailed information about the nature, rulers, and associations of specific portions of the Zodiac.

Furthermore, Arabic astrological texts brought new divinatory rituals and practices to the West. One such example is the method of interrogating the stars called "Horary astrology," in which an astrologer would analyze a chart for the moment that a significant question was asked to determine the outcome of the query. Another prominent example is the "Electional astrology," a practice concerned with choosing the most auspicious times for undertaking significant events or actions based on astrological considerations. Both of these methodologies became vital aspects of Western magical practice, enriching its divinatory powers and expanding its range of applications.

Islamic astrology's annotated translations also impacted Western correspondence systems involving celestial bodies. In particular, the introducing of texts discussing the magical properties of astrological talismans, which combined astrological knowledge with magical practices such as invocation and the use of sigils, had a profound impact on European ceremonial magic. These texts often attributed unique properties and powers to specific planets, constellations, and fixed stars, establishing a complex and nuanced system of correspondences subsequently incorporated into various Western magical traditions, such as Hermetism, Kabbalah, and the grimoire tradition.

It is crucial to note that the transmission of astrological knowledge between Islamic and Western scholars often involved mutual translations and adaptations. As Western scholars translated Islamic texts on astrology, alchemy, and other esoteric topics, these complex intellectual exchanges often led to the blending of ideas, evolving each tradition uniquely.

For example, the 12th-century translation movement, particularly in Spain, saw famous scholars such as Gerard of Cremona and John of Seville translating important Arabic astrological texts, among other disciplines, into Latin, disseminating the knowledge of Islamic astrology to a wider audience in Europe. These translations often led to the creation of hybrid systems, where Western scholars combined Arabic astrological techniques with indigenous knowledge, theology, or cosmology, resulting in substantial divergences between the respective magical traditions.

These mutual translations and exchanges demonstrate the interdependence of Islamic and Western esoteric and occult knowledge during the Middle Ages, a process that helped shape the complexities of both astrological and magical traditions. Consequently, the integration of medieval Islamic astrology's annotated translations into Western magical practices resulted in a deep and lasting influence, transformative to both cultures' intellectual and spiritual landscapes.
