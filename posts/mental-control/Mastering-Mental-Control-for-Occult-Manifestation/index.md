To fully understand and respond to this challenge, we must first lay a foundation for our understanding of thought patterns, emotions, environment, and symbolism. Then, delve into the development of mental control and how these aspects can be utilized by initiates in the occult to manifest desired outcomes.

Thought patterns are the habitual ways in which we process information and respond to situations, which, in turn, shape our emotions. Emotions are the feelings that arise as a result of our thoughts or as reactions to external situations and events. The environment encompasses the physical, emotional, and social factors that surround us, influencing both our thought patterns and our emotions. Symbolism refers to the use of symbols—a sign, mark, or object—that represents an idea, process, or principle without using words. 

In the esoteric and occult, mental control is essential for successfully navigating through spiritual experiences while maintaining balance. Mental control is the ability to influence and shape our thoughts, emotions, and reactions in order to achieve desired outcomes in both our inner (mental and spiritual) and outer (physical and social) worlds.

Now, let's examine the interrelations between these aspects:

1. Thought patterns and emotions: They are interconnected and influence one another; changing a thought pattern can lead to a change in emotions, and vice versa. For initiates in the occult, recognizing and altering negative thought patterns can result in improved emotional balance, inner clarity, and personal power.

2. Environment: Our environment greatly affects how we think and feel, and thus, our mental control. A positive environment—such as a peaceful, organized space for meditation or ritual—can induce mental stability and focus. Initiates in the occult can also use symbolism within their environment to evoke specific energies, thoughts, and emotions to manifest their intentions.

3. Symbolism: It is a powerful tool for change and transformation in the occult. By understanding the meaning and significance of symbols, initiates can tap into their subconscious mind, make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, and use the symbols as catalysts for the manifestation of their desires.

To effectively utilize these aspects for mental control and manifesting desired outcomes, initiates in the occult should:

A. Develop self-awareness: This is crucial in identifying thought patterns, underlying emotions, and environmental influences on mental control. Initiates should practice mindfulness, self-reflection, and honest introspection to gain insights into their internal processes.

B. Cultivate mental discipline: This involves developing the willpower and focus needed to shape thoughts, emotions, and reactions intentionally. Initiates can use meditation, visualization, concentration exercises, and other spiritual practices to build mental resilience and control.

C. Manage the environment: Initiates should create a conducive space for their practices—physically, emotionally, and symbolically. They can use sacred symbols, elemental representations, and harmonious arrangements to create an area that aids in mental control and manifestation.

D. Foster a deep understanding of symbolism: Study and explore the meanings and associations of different symbols, and integrate them into rituals and practices for powerful results. This can be achieved through reading books, joining esoteric groups, and engaging in intuitive exploration.

In conclusion, the development of mental control and successful manifestation in the occult is a dynamic process involving thought patterns, emotions, environment, and symbolism. Initiates should strive to develop self-awareness, mental discipline, a conducive environment, and a profound understanding of symbolism in order to effectively use these aspects together. By doing so, they can manifest desired outcomes in both their inner and outer worlds, achieving greater spiritual growth and self-mastery.
