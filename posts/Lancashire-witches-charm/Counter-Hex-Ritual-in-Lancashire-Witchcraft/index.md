## The Rite of Etheldra's Shield

The Rite of Etheldra's Shield is an elaborate counter-ritual used to detect and counteract hexes cast by adept Lancashire witches. Drawing from the depths of Lancashire witchcraft lore, this ritual calls upon the wisdom of the ancient witch, Etheldra, who was both a powerful sorceress and expert in disarming hexes in her time.

Before performing the ritual, ensure that you possess impeccable knowledge and mastery in the art of Lancashire Witchcraft and are well-versed with the associated lore, incantations, and gestures.
**Step 1**: Preparing the Ritual Space
### 1.1 Find an isolated area close to a natural water source, such as a river or a stream.
### 1.2 Cleanse and purify the area with a mixture of spring water and wormwood to avoid interference from malevolent forces.
### 1.3 Arrange a circle of 13 rowan branches, each of equal length, around the ritual space.
### 1.4 Light a white candle in the center of the circle and place a large, flat stone (preferably from a nearby Lancashire quarry) in front of the candle.
**Step 2**: Gathering the Enchanted Objects and Ingredients
### 2.1 Acquire a lock of hair from the hexed individual.
### 2.2 Obtain a dowsing pendulum made from Lancashire jet.
### 2.3 Brew a potion of cramp bark, vervain, and mandrake boiled in rainwater collected during the new moon.
### 2.4 Craft a talisman from moss agate containing protective symbols specific to Lancashire witchcraft, such as the Five Fold Knot and the Witch's Knot.
**Step 3**: Incantations and Gestures
### 3.1 Hold the lock of hair in your left hand, invoking the powers of Earth and Water, and the dowsing pendulum in your right hand, channeling the energies of Fire and Air.
### 3.2 Begin with the invocation of Etheldra by reciting the following verses:

"Grandmother of shadows, wise Etheldra fair,
I call upon thee, heed my plea for your care.
By Earth, Water, Fire, and Air, unite and bind,
Help me discern the hexes cast and the way to unwind."

### 3.3 Proceed with the hex identification verse:

"With the pendulum of jet, unveil the hex unknown,
Guide me through the dark mysteries that are sewn.
By the power of the ancestral shadows' might,
Reveal to me now the source of the blight."

### 3.4 As you chant the incantations, perform intricate gestures by weaving the pendulum in circles and spirals to create a powerful web of energy that will strengthen the bond to Etheldra.

### 3.5 Use the pendulum to dowse the hex's origin and nature. Internalize the information revealed by Etheldra's guidance.
**Step 4**: Counteracting the Hex
### 4.1 Prepare a clay tablet infused with mugwort as a medium for counteracting the hex.
### 4.2 Using your index finger, draw the identified hex root symbol on the tablet while chanting the following counter-hex incantation:

"By Etheldra's wisdom, I overcome this plight,
From darkness to light, the hex take flight.
By the power of the talisman forged with sacred art,
May its influence wane, and the curse depart."

### 4.3 Ensure you're wearing the moss agate talisman for protection and have a vial of the potion close at hand.
**Step 5**: Safeguarding Oneself and Identifying Counterattacks
### 5.1 An adept Lancashire witch may detect your defensive moves and attempt a retaliatory strike. Be alert to signs such as sudden chills, cawing crows, or unexplained disruptions in the environment.
### 5.2 Maintain your connection to Etheldra's wisdom throughout the ritual to anticipate and counter any additional hexes through the power of her guidance and the energy of the talisman.
### 5.3 In cases of a counterattack, drink a sip of the potion to fortify your defenses and chant the protective incantation:

"Under Etheldra's shield, secure and strong,
I stand protected from all that is wrong.
Oh, ancestors, in you, I trust and seek,
Shield me now from malevolence bleak."

By performing The Rite of Etheldra's Shield diligently and precisely, the hex shall be effectively dispelled, and one's safety ensured. This sacred ritual serves as a powerful testament to the wisdom of the legendary Lancashire witch, Etheldra, and her unrelenting capacity to subdue malicious forces.
