excerpt: > 
  Design a disturbing and esoteric ritual that serves as an initiation into the enigmatic world of the fae. Incorporate ancient, arcane symbols and eerie incantations that echo through the darkest corners of one's mind. Employ the use of peculiar, otherworldly artifacts obtained from clandestine sources, and integrate the unnerving elements of nature, such making use of blood moonlit nights or secluded groves with twisted trees. The ceremony should culminate in a terrifying encounter with a malevolent fae being, resulting in the participant's total submission to the unsettling powers of their new, haunting realm.

## Title: The Blood Moon Obeisance

Setting: A secluded grove deep within an ancient, twisted forest on the night of a blood moon.

Required Artifacts:
1. The Orb of Deirdre – A mysterious and otherworldly sphere crafted from fae-touched obsidian, rumored to have once belonged to a powerful fae queen.
2. The Silver Sigil – A pendant engraved with an arcane symbol whose origins have been lost to time.
3. The Athame of Laran – A ceremonial dagger rumored to have been forged in the heart of the fae kingdom.

Preparations:
1. The participant must fast for three days prior to the ritual, consuming only water infused with the petals of the enigmatic nightshade flower.
2. Two days before the ritual, the participant must gather moonwort and weeping widow's fern from the forest, taking care to step lightly and leave offerings of fresh cream to appease hidden fae folk.

The Ritual:
1. The participant enters the grove at midnight, wearing a black robe and holding the Orb of Deirdre in their left hand.
2. They must trace a twisted path through the grove to the base of the largest and darkest tree, known as the Whispering Sentinel.
3. At the base of the Whispering Sentinel, the participant uses the Athame of Laran to carve the arcane symbol from the Silver Sigil into the bark.
4. The participant gathers their gathered moonwort and weeping widow's fern and lays them at the foot of the tree, softly speaking the eerie incantation:

"By moon's blood, by shadow's kiss,
By the ancient rite that none may miss,
I call upon the hidden fae,
To weave for me their twisted way."

5. The participant kneels and lays the Orb of Deirdre on the ground before them, as an offering to the spirits of the forest.
6. While still kneeling, the participant holds the Silver Sigil in both hands and recites the following words, their voice growing in intensity:

"In the presence of a world unseen,
I bind myself to the realms between.
Bound by blood, bound by blade,
I submit to the powers of the fae."

7. With the ceremonial dagger, the participant scores a shallow cut on the palm of their right hand, allowing their blood to drip onto the arcane symbol engraved on the tree.

8. In the silence that follows, the grove's shadows seem to grow darker, as whispers from the fae realm echo through the night. A malevolent being with glittering eyes and twisted form emerges, demanding the participant's pledge of obedience.

9. With the creature before them, the participant swears their eternal submission to the powers of the fae, merging their essence with the haunting forces that now course through their veins.

10. Once the being vanishes back into the shadows, the newly initiated one may leave the grove, forever bound to the eerie realm of the fae and haunted by the knowledge they alone possess.
