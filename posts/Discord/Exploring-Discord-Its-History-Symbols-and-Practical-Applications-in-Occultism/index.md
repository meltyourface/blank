## Chapter 6: Discord in the Occult

### I. Historical Background

Discord, a concept widely explored in the occult, traces its roots back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece. A central figure in Greek mythology, Eris, the goddess of strife and discord, embodies the destructive potential of chaos. In Gnosticism, the Demiurge, a creator deity associated with chaos, highlights the importance of discord in the cosmology of early Christian sects.

In the 20th century, the Principia Discordia emerged as a primary text devoted to the study and celebration of chaos, discord and transformation in the countercultural movement of Discordianism. Championing the cause for humor and play in spiritual practices, Discordianism defies the dogmas of conventional religion through inventive rituals and techniques that acknowledge the role of chaos in the universe.

### II. Key Concepts

1. **Discordianism**: A contemporary belief system and countercultural movement that emphasizes chaos, disorder, and transformative change. It revolves around the worship of Eris and the acceptance of discord as a cosmic force shaping our reality.

2. **Synchronicity**: Carl Jung’s psychological concept of meaningful coincidences that seemingly defy causal relationships. Synchronicity plays an essential role in the occult understanding of discord by validating the significance of apparent chaos and randomness.

3. **Chaos Magick**: A modern, results-oriented magical practice that relies on paradigm-shifting techniques and personalized symbolism for harnessing the power of chaos. Combining elements of Discordianism and other belief systems, Chaos Magick emphasizes the importance of personal experience and experimentation in spiritual development.

### III. Practical Applications

1. **Magical rituals and spells**: Occult practitioners—especially chaos magicians—utilize discord as a primary source of power. By embracing chaos in a ritual, practitioners can harness its unlimited potential to manifest personal desires or create transformative change in various aspects of life.

2. **Sigil Magick**: Sigil Magick is a technique that involves the creation of personalized symbols (sigils) to represent one's intentions or desires. Practitioners use various methods, such as Automatic Drawing or the Chaos Star, to create sigils charged with discord's raw energy. Once charged, these sigils act as catalysts for the manifestation of one's desires.

3. **Meditation and visualization**: Embracing and understanding discord can sharpen a practitioner's ability to navigate turbulent circumstances and maintain mental equilibrium. Techniques such as visualizing oneself surrounded by discord or focusing on the concept of chaos during meditation are helpful for attuning to the energy of discord.

### IV. Sigils and Symbols

1. **The Five-Fingered Hand of Eris**: A symbol representing the Discordian concept of the "Law of Fives," which posits that all things are interconnected and influenced by discord in some way. The symbol consists of an open hand exhibiting five evenly spaced fingers.

2. **Chaos Star**: Also known as the Chaosphere, this symbol is an eight-pointed star that signifies the infinite possibilities and potential of chaos. Widely used in Chaos Magick and Discordianism, the Chaos Star is a powerful representation of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of discord.

3. **The Golden Apple of Discord**: A symbol derived from the myth of the Judgment of Paris, in which the goddess Eris deliberately sparked discord among the gods by throwing a golden apple inscribed with the words "To the fairest." In the occult, the Golden Apple represents the transformative power of chaos and its potential to reveal latent qualities or provoke valuable insights.

By delving into the history, key concepts, practical applications, and symbols associated with discord, students of the occult can better understand the role of chaos and transform their lives by harnessing its powerful energy.
