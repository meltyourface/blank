In order to carry out the comprehensive LeklaiThai folk magic ritual for the cleansing, deactivation, and respectful disposal of Leklai stones, follow the steps outlined below. This ritual ensures the release of bound spirits, neutralization of lingering energies, and pays homage to the elemental forces and guardian spirits of the Leklai.

1. **Preparation**:
Gather the following items needed for the ritual:
- The Leklai stones that have completed their magical purpose
- Clean, purified water
- White sesame oil
- Incense sticks
- Candles
- Offerings of flowers, fruits, and a glass of water
- A white cloth or sacred cloth representative of the spiritual world in Thai folk magic
- A special container, preferably a pottery vessel, in which to place the deactivated Leklai stones

2. **Setting the space**:
Create a sacred space for the ritual by selecting an area free from disturbances and with a positive environment, preferably outdoors in nature or a place where the forces of nature can be felt. Cleanse the area of any negative energies with the burning of incense and by sprinkling purified water around the space.

3. **Invocation of guardian spirits and elemental forces**:
Light the candles and incense sticks as a symbol of your faith and reverence for the guardian spirits and elemental forces of the Leklai. Offer prayers and recite mantras to call upon their presence and assistance in carrying out the ritual. Place the offerings of flowers, fruits, and the glass of water within the sacred space, as a means of demonstrating respect and gratitude.

4. **Cleansing the Leklai stones**:
Place the Leklai stones in the purified water, submerging them completely. Recite mantras or prayers of purification as you gently wash the stones. After cleansing, dry them with the white cloth or sacred cloth.

5. **Deactivation of the Leklai stones**:
Once the stones are cleansed, anoint them with the white sesame oil. This act ceremoniously deactivates their energies and severs the links to the bound spirits within. Speak words of release, directing the spirits to return to their natural realms, free from the confines of the Leklai stones.

6. **Honoring the elemental forces and guardian spirits**:
Offer prayers and words of gratitude to the elemental forces and guardian spirits of the Leklai. Thank them for their assistance in the ritual, and for their support in ensuring the Leklai stones served their purpose. Extinguish the candles and incense sticks as a symbol of the completion of the ritual.

7. **Respectful disposal of the Leklai stones**:
Place the deactivated Leklai stones into the special container, such as a pottery vessel. Bury the container in a natural and sacred place, where the energies of the stones can be neutralized and returned to the Earth.

8. **Closing the ritual**:
Express your gratitude to the spirits and forces who helped you in the ritual process. Allow the sacred space to return to its natural state, allowing the offerings to remain in place to fully honor and respect the guardians and elements.

By completing this ritual, the Leklai stones are cleansed, deactivated, and respectfully disposed of in accordance with traditional Thai spiritual practices, ensuring the release of bound spirits and the neutralization of lingering energies, all while paying homage to the elemental forces and guardian spirits of the Leklai.
