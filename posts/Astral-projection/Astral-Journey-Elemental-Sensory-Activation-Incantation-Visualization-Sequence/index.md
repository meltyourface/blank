Incantation:

By the sacred breath of Thoth and the gleaming Eye of Ra,
As I step through the veil and merge with the astral tide,
I awaken the heightened senses within my astral form,
And enshroud myself in the expanse that bridges time and space.

Vivid elementals, align my heightened sight with the flame of fire,
A vibrant red glow that surges and ignites my inner vision,
With the celestial wisdom of Mars, guiding my astral eyes to see,
As the realm of the celestial unfolds before me, vast and boundless.

Serene currents, awaken my astral ears with the breeze of air,
A piercing yellow spark that whispers secrets through the winds,
With the subtle knowledge of Mercury, heightening my perception,
As the resonance of hidden voices carry me unto the astral plane.

Majestic waves, immerse my astral touch in the depths of water,
A shimmering blue aura that ripples with the caress of intuition,
With the flowing wisdom of the Moon, opening my sense of feeling,
As the astral tide conducts me through the ethereal seas of possibility.

Sturdy mountain, nourish my astral essence with the core of earth,
A grounding green embrace that fortifies my spirit with stability,
With the steadfast knowledge of Saturn, providing me unyielding foundation,
As the expansion of the astral sustains me in the ever-shifting expanse.

By the sacred geometry of ancient guardians and the mystical sphere,
Enveloped in the violet aura of Jupiter, I wield senses untamed,
In the divine presence of the cosmos, aligned with astral energies,
I journey through the astral plane, perceiving the unseen with heightened senses.

Visualization Sequence:

1. Begin by visualizing the sacred Eye of Ra, glowing gold and watching over you as you prepare for astral travel. Feel the connection with ancient wisdom and protection.

2. Visualize a pulsating red sphere around you, emanating the intense heat of fire, as the energy of Mars infuses your astral body, enhancing your sight.

3. Envision a swirling yellow vortex, resonating with the gentle wind of air, as Mercury's energy heightens your auditory senses, amplifying your hearing.

4. Picture a rippling blue pool of water, reflecting the moonlight, as lunar energies imbue your astral body with heightened touch and intuitive awareness.

5. Visualize a solid green cube, emanating the stable energy of earth, as the protective energy of Saturn empowers your astral essence with unyielding grounding.

6. Finally, envision a brilliant violet pyramid, glowing with the essence of Jupiter, connecting your heightened senses to the astral plane's vast and pulsating energies.

Physical Gestures:

1. Hold your hands open, palms facing upwards, and take a deep breath in, feeling the essence of Thoth's sacred breath within you.

2. Move your hands upwards, forming a triangle, with your fingertips touching in the center. This symbolizes the connection between the physical and astral realms.

3. Touch your thumbs to your forehead, stimulating your third eye, and then move your hands outwards, opening yourself to receiving heightened sensory awareness.

4. As you pronounce each element, trace the corresponding geometric shape in the air with your index finger to attune your senses to the elemental energies.

5. Upon completion, bring your hands back together in the triangle shape, and feel the combined energies of the elements and planets infusing your astral body with heightened sensory perception for your astral journey.
