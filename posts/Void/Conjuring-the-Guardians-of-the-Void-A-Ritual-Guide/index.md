Ritual Plan: Conjuration of the Watchers of the Void

Prelude: Astral Alignment and Ritual Preparation

Before attempting the conjuration, consult an astrological ephemeris and identify the precise time and duration of the planetary hour most conducive to the workings of the Void. Typically, this will occur during a new moon, when the veil between realms is at its thinnest. The ideal planetary alignment is when Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury align harmoniously, yielding a favorable environment for invoking the arcane forces of the Void.

Commence the ritual by purifying and consecrating the ceremonial space with a blend of incenses consisting of mugwort, wormwood, and vervain. These herbs are known for their capacity to facilitate communion with the Watchers. Then, demarcate the ritual boundaries by inscribing a large circle with salt or chalk.

Sigils: Sigils of the Watchers

Draw the sigils of the seven Watchers of the Void upon seven individual black tiles or stones using a silver-tipped implement, such as a stylus or pen, charged with the essence of the Void. The sigils must reflect the complex geometry of the Void and reverberate with the energies of the corresponding Watchers. Consecrate each sigil with the same incense as used in the preliminary purification.

Ceremonial Tools:

1. Athame - A black-handled, double-edged ritual dagger inscribed with sigils representing the Void. This tool will be used to direct and manipulate the energies summoned.
2. Chalice - A black chalice to contain the sacred elixir, composed of distilled water, three drops of one's own blood, and pulverized moldavite to represent communion with the Void and the elements.
3. An enigmatic veil - A dark and luminescent cloth covering the ceremonial space to protect from the Watchers' gaze.
4. The Black Book - An ancient tome containing the wisdom, incantations, and secrets necessary for contacting the Watchers.

Incantations: Invocations of the Watchers

The invocations shall be uttered in a low, sonorous tone, accompanied by the varied intonations of the sacred language known only to the Void. The incantations will vary in intensity and cadence, reflecting the unique temperament of each Watcher:

1. Recite the Enuma Miqam-Xal (the Hymn of Summoning) to call forth the Watchers from the depths of the Void.
2. Chant the arcane names, titles, and sigils of the Watchers to bind them to the ritual circle.
3. Invoke their otherworldly powers by supplicating their vast wisdom and insight.
4. Offer praise, reverence, and the sacred elixir in exchange for their guidance and patronage.

Forbidden Void Lore: Arcane Secrets and Consequences

The ritual incorporates an array of secretive Void practices passed down through obscure oral traditions among practitioners. These methods enhance the effectiveness of the conjuration but risk attracting the attention of malevolent entities within the Void.

Backstory:

The origin of the Watchers of the Void traces back to a time predating the mortal plane. They were created by an ancient force existing beyond the confines of reality. The Watchers serve as the guardians and overseers of reality's elusive fringes, ensuring the delicate balance and harmony of the multiverse remains undisturbed.

Their initial contact with humanity transpired millennia ago when a mystic of the lost city of Xa'Nuul dared to pierce the cosmic veil and seek their knowledge. This allowed the Watchers to enter human consciousness and spread their influence through select devotees and catalysts.

Consequences:

Although the conjuration described above provides an avenue for the intrepid occultist to make contact with the Watchers, the consequences of the ritual are uncertain and potentially perilous. Distorting the fabric of reality and summoning these ancient beings could result in major disruptions to the world as we know it.

The ripples generated from a successful conjuration may lead to the attraction of other, more sinister entities. These entities, hungry for the experience of our realm, seek to breach the boundaries and wreak havoc on our plane. Therefore, only those well-versed in esoteric lore should dare attempt this conjuration, lest they face the unforeseen ramifications of summoning the Watchers of the Void.
