In addressing the challenge of identifying a historical figure who employed esoteric practices and analyzing the interplay between their spiritual beliefs and sociopolitical resistance, I will focus on the life and impact of Aleister Crowley. Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), a prominent British occultist and counterculture figure, serves as a prime example of the symbiosis between esoteric practices and sociopolitical resistance. 

Crowley was instrumental in shaping modern occult movements, as he founded the religious philosophy of Thelema and was an influential member of several secret societies, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), and the A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum). His spiritual beliefs were rooted in the idea of individual liberation and the discovery of one's true will, which frequently took the form of transgression against societal norms and expectations.

The first step in critically analyzing the interplay between Crowley's spiritual beliefs and sociopolitical resistance is understanding his background and formation of Thelema. Crowley was raised in a strict Christian household, but he rebelled against this upbringing and sought an alternative spiritual path. This led him to immerse himself in esoteric practices, such as ceremonial magic, astrology, alchemy, and tarot.

In 1904, Crowley claimed to have received a revelation from a supernatural entity named Aiwass, resulting in the publication of "The Book of the Law." This foundational text of Thelema introduced its central precept, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will." This concept emphasized the individual's pursuit and expression of their "True Will" as the ultimate good while encouraging the dismantling of repressive societal structures that stood in the way of spiritual growth.

To understand the sociopolitical aspects of Crowley's life, it is essential to acknowledge the era he inhabited. Victorian society was marked by strict moralism and social expectations regarding gender roles, sexuality, and religion. Crowley's Thelemic philosophy represented a direct challenge to these societal norms, as it promoted sexual, spiritual, and ideological liberation.

Moreover, Crowley's life and work exemplified the countercultural values of nonconformity and the disruption of societal norms. He was openly bisexual and engaged in subversive sexual practices. Additionally, he incorporated esoteric symbols and rituals into his works, such as the Gnostic Mass and the Liber AL vel Legis. Through these practices, Crowley aimed to reflect an alternative path to spiritual enlightenment that broke away from mainstream religious traditions.

The symbiotic relationship between counterculture and occultism can be seen in how Crowley's spiritual beliefs informed his sociopolitical resistance, and vice versa. The esoteric practices and philosophies he advocated were antithetical to the dominant social structures of his time, and his pursuit of personal liberation resonated with countercultural movements of the early 20th century. Crowley's defiance of societal norms in both his personal and spiritual life represents the interconnectedness of occultism and counterculture.

In summary, Aleister Crowley embodies the symbiotic relationship between counterculture and occultism. By exploring his spiritual beliefs rooted in Thelema, it becomes clear that the founding principles of this philosophy were, in many ways, antithetical to the social structure of the Victorian era. Crowley's esoteric practices, coupled with his defiance of societal norms, demonstrate the connection between spiritual beliefs and sociopolitical resistance. Therefore, Crowley's life exemplifies the interplay between occultism and counterculture, emphasizing the importance of this symbiotic relationship in understanding the broader implications of both phenomena.
