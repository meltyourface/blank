To properly address this knowledge challenge, we will first give an overview of Lovecraft's cosmicism, followed by an analysis of the representation of cosmicism in the three mentioned literary works – "At the Mountains of Madness," "The Shadow over Innsmouth," and "The Call of Cthulhu." Finally, we will analyze how these interconnected narratives reflect the insignificance of human existence and the implications of human morality and religious beliefs.

Cosmicism is a literary philosophy that emerged from the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, an early 20th-century author who expanded the horror genre into new realms of speculative fiction. Cosmicism posits that humanity's place in the universe is insignificant and that the cosmos is indifferent to our existence. From this stance, traditional structures of morality and religious belief are deemed arbitrary. Cosmicism often highlights the exploration of the unknown, terrifying truths, and a sense of awe about the universe's vastness and complexity.

#1 "At the Mountains of Madness"

In "At the Mountains of Madness," a team of explorers uncovers an ancient alien city buried within the Antarctic ice. The discovery of the city reveals a complex ecosystem of beings, which were the original creators of life on Earth. By exposing humanity's true origins, the explorers are forced to confront the idea that their existence might be a mere anomaly in the grand cosmic landscape. It also shatters their perception of human exceptionalism, demonstrating that humankind's significance within the universe is genuinely minuscule.

Key themes and ideas in "At the Mountains of Madness":
- The insignificance of humanity in the cosmic scale
- The importance of questioning traditional beliefs and paradigms
- The fragility of human understanding and perception

#2 "The Shadow over Innsmouth"

The narrative of "The Shadow over Innsmouth" revolves around a town tainted by the influence of otherworldly creatures known as the Deep Ones. By engaging in interspecies breeding and worshiping the powerful sea-god, Dagon, the inhabitants of Innsmouth disrupt accepted notions of morality and religion. As the narrator delves deeper into the small town's secrets, he encounters the chilling reality that one's ancestry, lineage, and identity might not be as concrete or reliable as believed.

Key themes and ideas in "The Shadow over Innsmouth":
- The prominence of hybridity and deviation from societal norms
- The mutability of human identity and the fluidity of ancestral roots
- The limits of human comprehension regarding external forces and the cosmos

#3 "The Call of Cthulhu"

In "The Call of Cthulhu," Lovecraft introduces one of his most iconic cosmic entities – Cthulhu, an ancient, godlike creature that represents catastrophic destruction. Cthulhu's emergence from the depths of R'lyeh symbolizes how humanity's surface-level fears and concerns pale in comparison to the vast, unknowable cosmic threats looming beyond our understanding. By uncovering hints of the Cthulhu mythos, the protagonist unveils the unsettling fact that humanity exists at the cosmic entities' whim, which will likely lead to humanity's ultimate doom.

Key themes and ideas in "The Call of Cthulhu":
- The unveiling of a deeper cosmic truth that negates human-centered concerns
- The significance of dreams and their potential to connect the human psyche with cosmic forces
- The implication of human helplessness against the vast cosmic horrors

# Analysis

The interconnection of these narratives highlights the insignificance of human existence within the infinite universe. The protagonists' discoveries radically alter their perceptions, revealing that humanity is dwarfed by the cosmic entities and the indifferent universe. Additionally, these works question the traditional structures of morality and religious beliefs by portraying alternative cosmic hierarchies that disregard human-centric values entirely. 

In conclusion, Lovecraft's cosmicism, as expressed through "At the Mountains of Madness," "The Shadow over Innsmouth," and "The Call of Cthulhu," emphasizes the insignificance of human existence within the grand cosmic scale. This concept, in turn, destabilizes human-centric moral systems and religious beliefs, prompting readers to contemplate their position within the vast, incomprehensible universe.
