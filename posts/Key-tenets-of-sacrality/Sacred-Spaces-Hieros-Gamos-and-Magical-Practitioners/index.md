In response to the knowledge challenge, let us first briefly define the three main concepts: the Hieros Gamos, the Axis Mundi, and the magico-religious practitioner.

The Hieros Gamos, or sacred marriage, refers to the symbolic union of opposite forces or dualities, most commonly represented by the marriage of a god and goddess, which is a key aspect in numerous esoteric traditions, religions, and mythologies. It symbolizes the balancing and harmonizing of masculine and feminine energies in an effort to create or restore wholeness within the cosmos.

The Axis Mundi represents the cosmic axis, or center of the world, which connects the earthly realm with the divine. It is a symbolical representation of the vertical connection between heaven and earth and may take various forms in different cultures (e.g., the World Tree, the mountain, the pillar or the cross).

The magico-religious practitioner is an individual who has acquired specialized knowledge and skills in working with sacred symbology, esotericism, and ritual practices, often undertaking the role of a mediator between the mundane and the divine.

Now let us analyze the essential relationship between these three concepts, as well as their shared symbolic significance in establishing sacred spaces and bridging the mundane and divine spheres across various esoteric traditions.

The Hieros Gamos, in various forms, serves as a vital component in the cosmologies of many esoteric traditions. Its representation of the sacred union or merging of opposites allows for the creation of a potent, balanced energy that can, in turn, give rise to the sacred space or Axis Mundi. This union transcends ordinary dualistic assumptions and mundane divisions, enabling contact with divine or transcendent spheres.

The Axis Mundi, as the center of the world and the point of connection between earthly and heavenly realms, is a crucial feature of sacred spaces across numerous traditions. Establishing this vertical connection, or recreating it in ritual settings, allows magico-religious practitioners to gain access to the divine and work towards the transformation of both the self and the world.

The role of the magico-religious practitioner, in terms of creating sacred spaces and bridging the mundane and divine spheres is multifaceted. The practitioner is responsible for ritually enacting the Hieros Gamos or incorporating its symbolism and significance into their practices. Through conducting rituals that celebrate and reenact this sacred union, the practitioner opens a channel to the divine, creating an energetic confluence, which can manifest as the Axis Mundi.

Moreover, the magico-religious practitioner serves as a mediator, maintaining a balance between the mundane and divine spheres. This balancing act is achieved by harmoniously integrating the lessons and wisdom of the Hieros Gamos and Axis Mundi, acknowledging and working with the interconnectedness between these realms.

In conclusion, the Hieros Gamos, the Axis Mundi, and the role of the magico-religious practitioner demonstrate a mutually essential relationship in establishing sacred spaces and bridging the mundane and divine spheres. Each concept provides a layer of symbolic depth, and when explored in unison, they reveal the interconnectedness that exists within many esoteric traditions, as well as the potential for self-development and spiritual growth that arises from engaging with these symbolic templates. Ultimately, the Hieros Gamos serves as a cosmological underpinning for the creation of sacred spaces, while the Axis Mundi symbolizes the point of connection, and the magico-religious practitioner acts as the mediator and conductor of these cosmic energies.
