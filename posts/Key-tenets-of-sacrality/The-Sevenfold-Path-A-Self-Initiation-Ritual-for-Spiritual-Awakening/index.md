## The Self-Initiation Rite of the Sevenfold Path

Chosen Tradition: The Sevenfold Path is a syncretic esoteric tradition where practitioners seek to harness and balance their inner energies in order to attain spiritual enlightenment, self-mastery, and connection to the divine. The tradition intertwines elements of Hermeticism, Qabalah, Eastern mysticism, and modern witchcraft practices. 

**Objective**: To facilitate a comprehensive self-initiation rite that will awaken the practitioner's inner energies, attune them to the forces of the universe, and create a lasting bond with the divine through 7 distinct stages.

Stage 1: Preparation
1. Choose a time and date that corresponds with a new moon for the self-initiation rite.
2. Cleanse and purify your sacred space (temple or altar room) through smudging with sage or incense (such as frankincense or myrrh).
3. Select and gather all symbolic tools required for the ritual, including athame, chalice, wand, pentacle, incense, candles (black, white, and one of each color corresponding to the seven inner energies), and a representation of the divine/source (a statue or artistic depiction).
4. Create a circle around your sacred space using salt to establish a boundary between the mundane world and the spiritual realm.
5. Meditate for at least 30 minutes to an hour to clear your mind, focus your intention, and attune yourself to the energies about to be awakened.

Stage 2: Invocation
1. Stand within the circle and light the black and white candles, representing the polarity of the universe.
2. Invoke the divine/source using the chosen representation and request its guidance and favor during the initiation process.
3. Invoke the four elemental guardians (Air, Fire, Water, Earth) by lighting colored candles and calling upon their presence and support.

Stage 3: Aligning with the Seven Inner Energies
1. Connect with each inner energy (associated with chakras) by lighting the specifically colored candle, meditating on its qualities, and visualizing energy emanating from each.
2. Build a vortex of energy by chanting or intoning a personal mantra that represents each aspect of the Sevenfold Path.

Stage 4: The Prayer of Ascension
1. Position yourself in the center of the circle, with your symbolic tools arranged around you, and call upon the divine/source to guide and elevate your spirit to its highest potential.
2. Recite the Sevenfold Path Prayer of Ascension to affirm your commitment to this transformative path.

Stage 5: Dedication and Oath
1. Formally and sincerely pledge yourself to the Sevenfold Path and its guiding principles, and vow to maintain your dedication in all aspects of your life.
2. Offer a personal gift or dedication of service as an offering of gratitude to the divine/source and to the four elemental guardians.

Stage 6: Sealing the Bond
1. Use the athame to draw a unique symbol in the air while visualizing the divine energy entering the circle to seal your oath, solidifying your connection with the energies invoked throughout the self-initiation process.

Stage 7: Closing the Ritual
1. Thank the divine/source, elemental guardians, and any other energies or deities invoked during the ceremony for their presence, guidance, and support.
2. Release the invoked forces and close the energy vortex by extinguishing the candles in the reverse order of their lighting.
3. Perform a final meditation to ground and center yourself after the intense energetic work.
4. Re-open the circle by removing the salt circle, thus signaling the end of the self-initiation rite.

Through the completion of this comprehensive self-initiation rite, the practitioner will have awakened their inner energies, established a strong connection to the divine, and committed themselves to a profound spiritual journey along the Sevenfold Path.
