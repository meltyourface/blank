In completing the task, we will analyze and juxtapose two emblematic Masonic symbols, the All-Seeing Eye and the Square and Compasses, which have origins traceable to different esoteric traditions.

**1. The All-Seeing Eye**

*Historical Background*
The All-Seeing Eye, also known as the Eye of Providence, is sourced from ancient Egyptian mythology and symbolizes the watchful gaze of the supreme deity. Historically, the All-Seeing Eye has been associated with the ancient Egyptian god Horus, representing protection, good health, and royal power. In the context of Freemasonry, it is used to represent the omniscient and omnipresent watchfulness of the Great Architect of the Universe, or God.

*Ritualistic Significance*
The All-Seeing Eye is an essential component of Masonic rituals and is often portrayed within a triangle or encircled by a beam of light. Its presence in Masonic ritual establishes divine oversight and guidance, reminding members of their duties, both morally and spiritually. The symbol serves as a constant reminder of the supreme being's pervasive presence even in the most secret of meetings.

*Degree Structures*
Although the All-Seeing Eye transcends various Masonic degrees, it gains prominence in the higher degrees of the York and Scottish Rite systems. The symbol is particularly significant in the Holy Royal Arch Degree (York Rite) and the 14th Degree of the Scottish Rite (The Grand Elect Perfect and Sublime Mason).

**2. The Square and Compasses**

*Historical Background*
The Square and Compasses are among the most recognizable and widely used symbols in Freemasonry, originating from the medieval stonemason's tools. The compass represents the heavens (spiritual or divine), while the square signifies the earth (material or human). Together, they symbolize the dualism of existence and the harmony between the divine and human realms.

*Ritualistic Significance*
In Masonic rituals, the Square and Compasses work in unison to create balance. The square enables Masons to assess their moral and ethical behavior, while the compass guides them towards spiritual enlightenment. Integral to rites and ceremonies, the Square and Compasses represent a Mason's ethical behavior and commitment to the teachings of speculative Freemasonry.

*Degree Structures*
The Square and Compasses are central to Masonic teachings across all degrees. The symbol appears in various Masonic lodges' ornaments and emblems worldwide, reflecting the symbol's universal acceptance by different Masonic rites, orders, and degrees.

**Comparative Analysis**

*Parallels*
1. Both the All-Seeing Eye and the Square and Compasses are vital symbols that serve as reminders of the core principles and spiritual foundations of Freemasonry.
2. Both symbols emphasize the search for divine guidance and assistance in maintaining a righteous and moral way of life.
3. Both symbols find usage across multiple degrees and orders within the broader structure of Freemasonry.

*Distinctions*
1. The All-Seeing Eye originates from ancient Egyptian mythology, whereas the Square and Compasses are inspired by medieval stonemasons' tools.
2. The All-Seeing Eye represents the watchful gaze of God and divine oversight over Masonic activities. In contrast, the Square and Compasses signify the harmonious interaction between the divine and human realms through moral and spiritual guidance.
3. The All-Seeing Eye gains prominence in higher degrees within the York and Scottish Rite systems, while the Square and Compasses permeate various levels and orders across Masonic rites and degrees.

The creative and spiritual richness found within the realm of occult symbology and Masonic rituals is evident in the depth and complexity of the All-Seeing Eye and the Square and Compasses. By examining these symbols and their historical contexts, ritualistic significance, and role in degree structures, we enhance our understanding of esoteric teachings and their impact on Freemasonry's foundations and practices.
