To thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the background and meaning of the concepts mentioned: Thelema, Agape, and Thelemic Magick. Thelema is a philosophy or religion established by the early twentieth-century English ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, rooted in the belief that every individual has a unique True Will, which is the inherent purpose of one's life. The central tenet of Thelema is commonly expressed in the axiom: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," and its corollary, "Love is the law, love under will." Within Thelema, Agape represents divine love or the highest form of love, drawn from the Greek word meaning love. Thelemic Magick is the practice of ceremonial magick and invoking the power of one's True Will in accordance with Thelemic principles.

The interplay between these concepts can be best understood through their connection to the idea of True Will. In the context of Thelema, True Will is the driving force that lies at the core of one's being, and the realization and pursuit of this will, is the primary objective of spiritual development. Agape plays a significant role in the manifestation of True Will as it transcends the mundane, possessive, and selfish forms of love, guiding the practitioner towards achieving harmony with their True Will. Thelemic Magick serves as the method or technique that practitioners use to encourage this connection and bring themselves in line with their Will.

The concept of True Will is central to the harmony and balance of the interplay between Thelema, Agape, and Thelemic Magick. In order to manifest one's True Will, an individual must embrace Agape, which purifies the intention of the practitioner and elevates their actions to a higher, more divine purpose. This divine love allows the initiate to surrender personal desires, ego, and mundane attachments, making room for the unfolding of the True Will. When Agape is combined with Thelemic Magick, the initiate can effectively use magickal practice as a tool to align themselves with their Will and ultimately attain spiritual transcendence.

In the practical application of these principles, an initiate can harmoniously implement Thelema, Agape, and Thelemic Magick by undertaking the following steps:

1. Self-examination: To manifest one's True Will and attain spiritual transcendence, the initiate should engage in self-examination and introspection, establishing a connection with their innermost self and understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and aspirations.

2. Development of Agape: By cultivating divine love, the initiate becomes capable of perceiving the world through the lens of Agape, transforming their actions and thoughts from being ego-driven to being in alignment with the greater purpose of the universe. This process involves learning selfless compassion, empathy, and surrendering personal desires for the well-being of others and the universe as a whole.

3. Integration of Thelemic Magick: By employing ceremonial magick and esoteric practices in accordance with Thelemic principles, the initiate can harness their inner power and align their actions with their True Will. This includes rituals, meditations, and other exercises designed to attune the practitioner with their Will and enhance their psychic and spiritual faculties.

4. Continual refinement: As the initiate progresses in their spiritual journey, they should consistently evaluate their actions, thoughts, and desires, ensuring they align with their True Will and Agape. This process of continual refinement and course correction helps the practitioner maintain harmony between Thelema, Agape, and Thelemic Magick.

In conclusion, the interplay between Thelema, Agape, and Thelemic Magick revolves around the concept of True Will and the spiritual transcendence that comes from realizing and fulfilling that Will. The key to harmonious application of these principles lies in cultivating divine love, which elevates personal desires and intentions, and utilizing Thelemic Magick practices to align with one's Will. Through self-examination, development of Agape, integration of Thelemic Magick, and continual refinement of actions, thoughts, and desires, the initiate can successfully manifest their True Will and attain spiritual transcendence.
