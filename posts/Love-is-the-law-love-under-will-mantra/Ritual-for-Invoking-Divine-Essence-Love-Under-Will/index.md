**Ritual Performance Script: The Invocation of Divine Essence - "Love is the law, love under will"**

1. *Selection and Consecration of a Suitable Ritual Space*
Choose a quiet, clean, and comfortable space to perform the ritual, preferably during the late afternoon or twilight hour. Prepare the space by clearing away any clutter and cleansing it with an appropriate mixture of water and salt. Arrange four candles at each cardinal point (north, east, south, west), representing the four elements and directions. Place a red rose at the center to symbolize the love aspect, and a sword (or athame) to represent will. Light some rose-scented incense to set the atmosphere and help you focus on the task at hand.

2. *Casting a Ritual Circle*
Stand at the eastern point of your ritual space and hold your athame, or your index finger, with your dominant hand pointing outward. Envision a white light emanating from the tip and walk clockwise around the entire space, drawing a circle of protection with the energy. Recite the following invocation as you complete the circle:

"By the power of the elements and guardians of the East, South, West, and North, I invoke the divine essence of Love is the law, love under will. May this circle be a sacred space for this ritual."

3. *Incorporation of Sacred Texts, Chants, or Mantras*
Recite the following verse from The Book of the Law, written by Aleister Crowley:

"4. Every man and every woman is a star. / 20. Every number is infinite; there is no difference. / 57. Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will." (I:4, I:20, I:57)

With each line, meditate briefly on the meaning. This reinforces the understanding of individuality, oneness, and the embodiment of Love is the law, love under will.

4. *Use of Ritual Tools*
Hold your wand, chalice, athame, and pentacle, one at a time, and feel their energy and symbolism connecting to the concept of Love is the law, love under will. For each tool, dedicate its use to the purpose of this ritual.

5. *Invocation of a Deity, Spirit, or Archetype*
Invoke the Egyptian goddess, Nuit, who is associated with the divine essence of Love is the law, love under will. Recite the following invocation:

"O Nuit, the Sky Goddess, Mother of all creation, I invoke your essence, as you symbolize the infinite love and unity of existence. Help me embody your boundless cosmic love and wisdom. Love is the law, love under will."

6. *Guided Visualization or Astral Journey*
Close your eyes and envision yourself traveling through a dark, starry night sky. With each star that you pass, feel the essence of Love is the law, love under will growing stronger around you. As you journey, feel your connection to your higher self expanding, and begin to merge with the star that represents your unique expression of love under will.

7. *Magickal Working or Spell*
Light a red candle and carve symbols of love and will into the wax while reciting:

"By the passion of Nuit and the flame alive, / Let the truth of love under will now thrive. / By the power of love, I am made whole, / As love under will completes my soul."

Allow the candle to burn out completely in a safe manner to manifest love under will's energy in your life.

8. *Grounding, Centering, and Closing the Ritual Circle*
Take deep breaths, focusing on grounding yourself and absorbing any leftover energy. Thank the invoked entities and, using your dominant hand, walk counterclockwise around the circle, envisioning the protective energy dissipating. Say:

"The circle is now open, but never broken. I give thanks to the energies and entities invoked today. Love is the law, love under will."

9. *Integration of Insights into Daily Life*
Reflect on the insights gathered during the ceremony and make a conscious effort to embody the principle of Love is the law, love under will in your relationships, work, and personal growth. Consider journaling your experiences and feelings as you progress on your spiritual path.
