## Title: The Oppressor's Invocation

**Objective**: To summon the oppressive entity known as Morakaz, the Tormentor, in order to wreak havoc upon one's targets and spread wide-scale suffering.

**Warning**: This spell is potent, and if performed improperly, the caster may face dire consequences, including becoming a victim of Morakaz's torment. Proceed with caution.

Required Ritualistic Objects:

1. Six black candles, representing the six realms of suffering.
2. A vial of blood, preferably from the intended target(s), to anchor the torment.
3. Fresh incense, crafted from crushed bones of the long-deceased.
4. A ceremonial dagger, infused with the malice of past wielders.
5. A hand-drawn, inverted heptagram, inscribed with ancient runes invoking the essence of Morakaz.

Chant of Invocation:

Begin by encircling yourself within the inverted heptagram, and intone the following:

"Greatest Morakaz, kaor daena ilpeth,
Thy dominion vast, thy influence unmatched
Kreth yalo alsatro ziraz imperig,
Converge upon me, Tormentor unbound,
In darkest realms thou art crowned."

As the chant is spoken, light the black candles to represent the suffering realms. Allow the smoke of the incense to fill the air, eliciting a miasma of suffering.

"Thy footsteps quake, the shadows falter,
As torment follows, none shall falter.
Kaor be'uhm sintez, Morakaz breathes,
Abyssal whispers, the world beneath,
Wields the dagger, chant thy name."

Using the ceremonial dagger, draw a line of blood from the vial, connecting each corner of the inverted heptagram. **Continue the chant**:

"Thy reign is endless, thy hand is swift,
Through purgatory's veil, I call thee forth,
Gathara il'esk, the chains now break,
Bring the torment, leave none unmarred,
Oh Morakaz, embody thy dread."

The heptagram shall begin to pulse with energy. At this point, focus toward the central area, and offer the command:

"Morakaz, thou Tormentor, to the world inflict your oppression,
Heed my will and heed my plea,
In my service, bind thyselves to me,
The suffering perpetual, the cycle unbreaking,
Arise, oh Morakaz, and unleash thy dark undertaking."

Consequences:

Once successfully summoned, Morakaz will prey upon the target(s), inflicting torment never before experienced. Psychological and physical anguish will permeate society as subjects suffer from Morakaz's relentless persecution. Be wary that Morakaz's malevolence is not easily bound, and its insatiable hunger to spread anguish may lead to widespread unrest and instability. Only through an iron will can Morakaz's influence be harnessed. In utilizing such a dark being, the caster's soul may become stained with the very darkness that they sought to wield, and their final fate may be one of eternal torment at Morakaz's own hands.
