excerpt: >
  1. Identify and analyze the development of coded language and secret dialects within groups facing persecution, exploring the historical context of their creation and their implications in providing identity and security for these communities.
  
  2. Examine the utilization of linguistic strategies and rhetorical devices employed by persecuted individuals to navigate and survive oppressive environments, such as the use of euphemisms, metaphors, allegory, and storytelling.
  
  3. Investigate the relationship between language change and the dynamics of power and subjugation within persecuted communities; assess how emerging linguistic patterns reflect evolving strategies for resistance, adaptation, or capitulation.
  
  4. Contrast the linguistic features of persecuted communities across various regional, cultural, and temporal contexts to evaluate commonalities and differences in their language use and socio-political condition.
