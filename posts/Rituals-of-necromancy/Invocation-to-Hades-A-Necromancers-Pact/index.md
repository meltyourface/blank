I invoke thee, O mighty Hades, Lord of the Netherworld and Ruler of the Dark Depths, Keeper of Souls and the great Guardian of the Afterlife. In the name of thy sacred power, the eternal balance between life and death, I beseech thee to lend me your protection and guidance during my perilous journey through the ethereal realms and shadowed chambers of the departed souls. Grant me safe passage and bestow upon me the wisdom and strength required to navigate the treacherous paths of the unliving.

By the symbols of the ancient Chthonic rites, I anchor my soul to this mortal plane. I inscribe the protective sigils of the Ankh and the Eye of Horus upon the ground, weaving the protective golden thread of Ariadne which shall serve as my lifeline through the labyrinthine darkness.

With the ashes of the departed, I draw upon my body the symbols of our covenant: the Scepter of Power, symbolizing thy rule over the Underworld, and the Key of Truth, which unlocks the hidden knowledge guarded by the Silent Gate. As I adorn my robes with sacred sashes of the dark priesthood, I ask that your immortal gaze fall upon me favorably.

Standing within this consecrated circle, I call upon the spirits of my ancestors who share the bond of blood. **In the ancient language of the dead, which only the initiated may speak, I recite these forbidden verses**:

"Y’zlathi thara, k’zgaroth na’yath,
A’klor tarek vest’ya maroth,
O Hades, n’vahla verthana seral,
Z’ghorunth krel’oth tormathenal.”

With these words, I summon the dark swans of Lethe to bear witness and validate my allegiance to thee, O Hades. In my hand, I hold the sacred chalice, filled with the waters from the River Styx, which solidifies my vows and binds our shared destinies together. I drink it and mix it with my blood, inviting thee into the fleshly vessel that is my body – for together, we shall uncover the fathomless secrets of the afterlife.

Astral pathways begin to unfurl before me, each a hidden passage into the depths of thy domain. Your guiding hand upon my shoulder, steers my course through the abandoned halls of the drowned and the forsaken alleys of the damned. In these shadowed lands, I shall walk unharmed, secure in the knowledge that my pact with thee grants me dominion over lesser shades and wraiths.

Through sorcerous talent and thy divine favor, I, the Necromancer, shall bring forth the wisdom and lore of the secret realms, from where souls walk in eternal twilight. So it is written, so it shall be.

By the power vested in me, I vow to honor our sacred Pact, to preserve the balance, respect thy boundaries and, above all, to serve thy will faithfully. In token of our communion, I seal this invocation with my name and with the blood that courses through my veins.

As I step forth into the uncertain darkness, I do so with the conviction that your unseen hand shall guide me through the intricate paths of this spiritual odyssey. In thy name, O Hades, I begin my journey through the veil, and in thy name shall I return, the living incarnation of thy influence and wisdom.

So it is spoken. So shall it be.
