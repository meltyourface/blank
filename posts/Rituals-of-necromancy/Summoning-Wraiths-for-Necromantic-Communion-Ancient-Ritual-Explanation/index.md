To summon and ensnare a maleficent wraith for the purpose of communing with and extracting arcane wisdom from the spirit of the deceased, one must approach the task with diligence, caution, and immense knowledge of the esoteric arts. The following is a comprehensive elucidation of the required components and steps necessary for performing this intricate and dangerous ritual.

Preparatory Measures:

1. **Collection of mystical reagents**: A variety of reagents are required for the invocation. These include the ashes of a deceased loved one or someone to whom the deceased was close, a vial of raven's blood, bone powder from the remains of the deceased, the petals of a dark rose, and a candle scented with a blend of necromantic herbs such as wormwood, mandrake, and henbane.

2. **Crafting of a sanctified binding circle**: A silver-chalk circle is used to bind the wraith to the physical plane, inscribed with runes and sigils that provide a protective barrier and enhance the strength of the rite. The base of the circle should be drawn with the ashes of the deceased loved one, mixed with the raven's blood to make a thick paste. Then, draw a series of interlocking seals and sigils in skilled and precise strokes of the silver chalk, taking care to continuously maintain focus on the purpose of the rite.

Ancient Verbal Incantations and Somatic Gestures:

1. Initiate the ritual at the stroke of midnight, beginning the incantation with the ringing of a ceremonial bell made from black iron, resonating with dark energies. 

2. Carefully light the necromantic candle, allowing the scent to fill the chamber. Arrange the other reagents in the center of the circle, placing the rose petals in a pattern representing the wraith's spirit you wish to ensnare.

3. Begin the incantation and somatic gestures simultaneously. The ancient language to recite is Aramaic, with each syllable uttered with perfect precision while your free hand performs a series of fluid and dexterous gestures in the air above the circle.

4. Upon completion of the incantation, the spectral presence of the wraith should manifest within the circle. The wraith's spirit is now bound to the circle, allowing you to extract and commune with the deceased.

Potential Outcomes and Risks:

1. **Unanticipated encounters with malevolent entities**: It is possible that hostile or unwanted spirits may be drawn to the dark energies of the ritual. The sanctified binding circle will generally provide protection, but you must remain vigilant and close the ritual immediately if sensed any malevolent presence outside the circle. 

2. **Repercussions of unbinding the wraith**: Abrupt dismissal or failure to contain the wraith can have disastrous consequences, including spiritual backlash, possession, or prolonged haunting. It is essential to unbind the wraith properly after the ritual. Slowly reverse the initial incantation and gestures, sealing the wraith's energy back within the bones and ashes. Carefully collect the remains and bury or store them in a consecrated space, ensuring their containment.

3. **Ensuring a controlled communion with the deceased's spirit**: Prepare a series of questions and requests beforehand, directing your full intention and focus on the desired outcomes. Establish strict boundaries and expectations with the wraith, using your willpower to command its cooperation. Remember, the success of the ritual relies on the balance of power and respect given to the spirit realm.

Summoning and ensnaring a maleficent wraith can result in accessing invaluable arcane wisdom or life-changing experiences. However, it is paramount to perform this rite with complete mastery, as even a single error can have dire consequences. Always approach the unknown with humility and respect, seeking deeper understanding, and harnessing the full potential of your craft.
