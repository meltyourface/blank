1) Formation and Development of The Golden Dawn's Secret Rituals:

The Golden Dawn was formed in 1887 by three Freemasons: William Wynn Westcott, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, and William Robert Woodman. One of their major contributions was the development of a system of high magic that combined various traditions, including the Kabbalah, Tarot, Alchemy, Astrology, and Christian mysticism.

Significantly, their secret rituals were derived from several sources, including Masonic rituals, the Key of Solomon, Rosicrucianism, and other Western esoteric traditions. Additionally, they developed a three-fold structure similar to that of Freemasonry, with the intention to make this an initiatory structure to guide individuals through a spiritual and transformative journey. The degrees within The Golden Dawn were structured to reflect their deep understanding and respect for the esoteric teachings within Masonry, as well as their continuing thirst for the unknown.

2) Interactions with Prominent Masonic Figures:

Some of the most prominent figures associated with The Golden Dawn had strong connections to Freemasonry. For instance, Westcott, Mathers, and Woodman were all Masons, as well as other significant members of The Golden Dawn like Dr. William Wynn Westcott, A. E. Waite, and Aleister Crowley.

Westcott was a respected physician and occultist who had previously been involved in the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, which served as a precursor to The Golden Dawn. Mathers was an accomplished scholar in the area of occultism and an influential figure in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, responsible for much of the group's teachings. Woodman, an eminent Freemason, and member of the Ars Quatuor Coronati research lodge, contributed to the foundational rituals of the Golden Dawn.

These interactions among the Masonic and Occult circles demonstrate how The Golden Dawn was both a product of Masonic interest in the esoteric arts, as well as a separate entity that developed its own unique rituals and teachings.

3) Influence and Conflict between their Mystical Teachings and Mainstream Freemasonry:

While The Golden Dawn's rituals and mystical teachings borrowed aspects from Freemasonry, they diverged and expanded upon the Masonic teachings significantly. This led to occasional conflicts and disagreements between the Masonic establishment and the Golden Dawn's membership.

The Golden Dawn pursued a more mystical and spiritual path, incorporating elements of the Kabbalah, Christian mysticism, and other esoteric practices that were not present in traditional Masonry. This often led to suspicion and skepticism among traditional Masons, with some viewing The Golden Dawn as a deviation from the perceived purity of the Masonic teachings.

Additionally, the association of controversial figures like Aleister Crowley within The Golden Dawn and its offshoots further fueled tensions with the mainstream Masonic lodges.

In conclusion, The Golden Dawn was an important esoteric offshoot of Freemasonry, which had its roots in an amalgamation of different Western occult traditions. The formation and development of its secret rituals, interactions with prominent Masonic figures, and instances of influence or conflict with mainstream Freemasonry, show that The Golden Dawn was not only an expression of interest in the esoteric arts within Masonry, but also a separate and unique entity that influenced modern-day occultism. Potential areas of further research could focus on exploring the detailed connections between Golden Dawn rituals and traditional Masonic rituals and investigating how the group's teachings have influenced contemporary occult movements.
