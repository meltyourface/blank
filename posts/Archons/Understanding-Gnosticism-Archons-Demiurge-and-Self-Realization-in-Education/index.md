To effectively respond to the knowledge challenge, we must first establish an understanding of the key concepts involved, such as Archons, Gnosticism, Platonic philosophy, and the Demiurge; then, we will delve into the interconnectedness of these ideas and their impact on a person's education and self-realization. 

1. The Concept of Archons:

Archons are supernatural beings found in Gnostic cosmology and are often portrayed as rulers, administrators, or powers within this worldview. They can either be benevolent or malevolent entities, depending on the Gnostic sect's interpretation. The Archons are also identified with planetary spheres and were often associated with the idea that they played a role in governing human destiny.

2. Gnosticism:

Gnosticism is an umbrella term for a variety of religious and philosophical movements that emerged in the first few centuries CE. Gnostics believed that the material world was corrupt and heavily influenced by the demiurge and the archons. Their goal was to attain gnosis, or self-realization, in order to transcend this imprisonment. The attainment of gnosis leads to spiritual perfection and unity with the divine realm.

3. Platonic Philosophy and the Demiurge:

Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher, conceived the Demiurge as the creative force responsible for shaping the material universe. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato describes the Demiurge as a benevolent entity who crafted the world with a perfect model in mind but was limited by the chaotic pre-existing matter. The concept of the Demiurge was later appropriated by Gnostics, who often depicted the being as a malevolent creator responsible for trapping humanity in the material world.

With the understanding of these key concepts, we can now examine their interconnectedness and their influence on one's education and self-realization.

1. Archons and Gnosis in Education:

The idea of the Archons as rulers of destiny implies a worldview where the forces governing one's life are external and sometimes even malevolent. In terms of education, this could relate to the authoritative sources of knowledge, such as traditional institutions and their imposed doctrines, which can hinder personal growth and self-realization. However, the very existence of these Archons drives the aspirant to seek Gnosis, and through the process, empowering them to break free from the control of external forces.

2. Gnosticism, Knowledge, and Self-Realization:

Pursuing Gnosis, or self-knowledge, is of paramount importance within Gnosticism. This spiritual quest encourages individuals to delve deep into their own psyche, explore the hidden powers within their minds, and awaken their truest potential. It is an entirely personal and unique journey of self-discovery and self-realization. Education through Gnosticism is acquired not through external sources, but rather, through experiential learning focused on inner transformation.

3. The Demiurge and the Search for Truth:

As mentioned earlier, the Demiurge is an entity that shaped and crafted the material world, though its essence is influenced by the Gnostic interpretation. In the context of education and self-realization, the Demiurge underscores the importance of understanding the origins and nature of creation, helping a person discern between the "shadows" of the material world and the reality of the spiritual plane. By studying the Demiurge's actions and intentions, aspirants can better grasp the concept of a fallen world and learn to distinguish between true knowledge (gnosis) and the deceptive illusions presented by the material world.

In conclusion, the interconnectedness between the Archons, Gnosticism, and the Platonic philosophy of the Demiurge has a significant impact on an individual's education and self-realization. By understanding the roles and relationships of these concepts, one can begin their journey of seeking true knowledge and inner transformation, overcoming the external chains and limitations placed upon them by the material world. The focus on personal experience and direct revelation emancipates the seeker from the imposed doctrines of traditional institutions, granting them the capacity to attain self-realization and spiritual perfection.
