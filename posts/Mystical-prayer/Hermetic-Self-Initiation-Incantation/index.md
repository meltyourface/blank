I choose the esoteric mystical path of Hermeticism as the foundation for this self-initiation incantation.

### I. Purification of the Self
In the name of Thoth, the scribe of wisdom, and the mighty Hermes Trismegistus, divine messenger and guide of the soul, I stand upon this sacred ground to be transformed and purified.

From the depths of the Prima Materia, I rise as a spark of divine intellect,
Borne within the darkness of the boundless night,
I seek the light of Gnosis, the wisdom of the ancients,
Awakened by the Emerald Tablet, alchemical Tome of Truth.

Within the crucible of the Great Work, I smelt the dross of ignorance,
And from the furnace of my soul, I extract the purest gold,
The essence of my being, honed in the fires of dedication and tempered by the waters of compassion,
Bringing forth my true self, a vessel worthy of the sacred mysteries.

### II. Ascension of Consciousness
I beseech the celestial energies, the planetary spirits, and the cosmic symphony,
To assist in the elevation of my awareness,
That I may ascend upon the wings of Mercury,
And find my place among the celestial spheres.

Through the realm of the divine Pymander, the sacred text reveals the hidden wisdom,
The teachings of the thrice-great Hermes, guide me on the path of illumination,
As the seven Hermetic Principles unveil the veil of reality and draw back the curtains of illusion,
I attune my soul to the eternal vibrations of truth.

Enlightened by the Corpus Hermeticum, I tune my consciousness,
Receptive to the Universal All, the Anima Mundi, the One Mind that pervades,
The highest source of wisdom intoning its sublime melody,
Bestowing upon me the gift of Gnosis, the key to the inner sanctum of my soul.

### III. Union with the Divine
As above, so below; as within, so without,
This sacred maxim, the cornerstone of my transformation,
Leads me through the innermost caverns of my soul,
To unite with the divine spark, igniting the eternal flame within me.

In the presence of deities and spiritual guides,
I swear my loyalty, offering my heart and soul to the Hermetic path,
From this day forth, I merge my essence with the boundless All,
An unbreakable bond, a marriage of spirit and matter, wrought in the celestial forge.

Dedicated and committed to the mystery tradition,
I step over the threshold and embrace my fate with open arms,
This sacred union, a pact with eternity, 
I vow to preserve, protect, and perpetuate the Hermetic truths, for now and forevermore.

By the sacred power of Thoth, I am reborn; 
A new adept, a seeker of light,
Submerged in the eternal, mystic ocean__,
My journey begins anew, my soul uplifted upon the wings of divine wisdom.
