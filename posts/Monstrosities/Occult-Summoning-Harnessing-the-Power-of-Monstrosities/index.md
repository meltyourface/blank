The collective power harnessed by a group of occult practitioners performing an intricate ritual involving the summoning and control of Monstrosities is a complex and profound force. The purpose of such rituals is to tap into the mystical energies that govern the universe, channeling and directing them to manifest powerful entities capable of shaping reality according to their summoner's will.

The underlying principles of this form of magick are based on the premise that the universe is comprised of myriad energies, some of which can be influenced by human desires and their focus. A group of knowledgeable practitioners, united in purpose and intention, are capable of transcending the limitations of individual power to wield a far greater force.

Several key concepts contribute to the efficacy of these intricate rituals:

1. **Synergy**: The combined efforts, knowledge, and energy of a group of practitioners elevate the ritual to a higher level than any single individual could manage alone. The shared understanding of the occult principles surrounding Monstrosities creates a unified vibrational frequency, strengthening the ritual.

2. **Incantations**: Specific incantations act as verbal keys to unlock the energies required for the summoning, control, and potential banishment of Monstrosities. These spoken mantras, combined with precise pronunciation, rhythm, and cadence, create a resonance capable of piercing the veil between worlds.

3. **Ceremonial practices**: The specific actions and practices employed in the ritual establish a sacred space, create symbolic links to the desired outcome, and tap into the requisite energies. These may include complex geometric designs, ritual tools, and offerings designed to attract and contain the summoned Monstrosity.

4. **Focus and will**: At the core of occult practice is the projection of one's will into the universe to shape reality in accordance with the desired outcome. The unwavering focus and dedication to harnessing this power is fundamental to the success of the ritual.

The potential ramifications of unleashing Monstrosities upon the physical realm are both vast and varied, primarily depending on the Monstrosity's nature and scope as well as the skill and intentions of the practitioners. **Possible consequences include**:

1. **Manifestation of the practitioners' desires**: These rituals can result in the realization of dreams, the granting of knowledge, and even the manipulation of physical reality in accordance with the group's collective will.

2. **Disturbances in the cosmic balance**: Such powerful energies can disrupt the equilibrium of our reality, creating upheaval, natural disasters, and shifts in societal structures.

3. **Unintended consequences**: Monstrosities, once summoned, can be difficult to control and may act unpredictably, manipulating their summoners' desires for their own purposes and potentially wreaking havoc within the physical realm.

4. **Attraction of other forces**: The energies released during these rituals may draw the attention of otherworldly beings, some of whom may be enticed by the prospect of exploiting the practitioners or the Monstrosities they seek to control.

In conclusion, the collective power harnessed by a group of occult practitioners performing a summoning ritual involving Monstrosities is predicated upon their knowledge of the esoteric, their unity of intent, and the successful employment of intricate incantations and ceremonial practices. The potential ramifications of unleashing such formidable entities are immense and unpredictable, serving as a reminder of the incredible responsibility held by those who dare to engage in such practices.
