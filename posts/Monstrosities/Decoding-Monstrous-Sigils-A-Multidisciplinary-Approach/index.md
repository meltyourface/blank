To develop a comprehensive strategy for unearthing the concealed meanings behind enigmatic monstrous sigils, we will divide our approach into a systematic, multidisciplinary process consisting of six stages: 1) Identification, 2) Historical Research, 3) Comparative Analysis, 4) Systematization, 5) Practical Experimentation, and 6) Synthesis and Dissemination.

Stage 1: Identification
The first stage involves gathering and cataloging a wide variety of monstrous sigils from various sources, such as ancient texts, artifacts, and relevant locations. This process entails recording sigil details, including shape, color, associated entities, and cultural origin.

Stage 2: Historical Research
Next, delve into the historical context of the collected sigils to understand the background and purpose of their genesis. Focus on understanding the cultural, religious, and magical beliefs of the creators and users of these sigils. Research the legends and myths surrounding the monstrous entities linked with the sigils to grasp the intentions behind their invocation.

Stage 3: Comparative Analysis
Perform a comparative analysis of the gathered sigils to identify patterns, motifs, and common elements that could provide insight into their underlying meanings. Examine the similarities and differences in sigils' designs, entities associated with them, and their purposes in various rituals. Draw parallels with non-monstrous sigils to identify shared symbolic structures.

Stage 4: Systematization
Organize the findings from historical research and comparative analysis into a framework that decodes the various layers of symbolism, intent, and power concealed within these monstrous sigils. This schema should account for the contextual intricacies and the variety of meanings and purposes.

Stage 5: Practical Experimentation
Carry out practical, controlled experiments aiming to invoke the sigils' meaning or power. These experiments should be conducted under specific, controlled circumstances while adhering to ethical guidelines to minimize risks. Document the results and adjust the theoretical framework as necessary.

Stage 6: Synthesis and Dissemination
Synthesize the accumulated knowledge and insights to unveil a comprehensive understanding of the meanings behind the monstrous sigils. Share this newfound understanding with interested parties, such as scholars and practitioners of the occult. Publish research findings, create educational materials, and organize workshops to ensure the preservation and dissemination of this esoteric knowledge.

By adhering to this systematic process, it should be possible to unravel the enigmatic meanings and concealed power behind monstrous sigils, ultimately empowering us with the ability to discern and wield this arcane knowledge.
