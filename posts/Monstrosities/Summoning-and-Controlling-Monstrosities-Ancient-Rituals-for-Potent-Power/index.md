The collective power harnessed by a group of occult practitioners performing an intricate ritual involving the summoning and control of Monstrosities is a potent force rooted in the combined energies, intent, and willpower of the participants. This power taps into the primal, otherworldly forces that govern the innate nature of these Monstrosities and enables the practitioners to bend these beings to their will. 

The underlying principles that dictate the art of summoning and controlling Monstrosities revolve around three main tenets: attunement, connection, and command. 

1. **Attunement**: Practitioners must first attune their own personal energies and consciousness to the plane or realm in which these Monstrosities dwell. This is often achieved through a combination of meditation, invocation, and the utilization of potent symbols and sigils that act as markers for these eldritch dimensions.

2. **Connection**: Once attuned, the practitioners work collectively to forge a conduit between their realm and that of the summoned Monstrosities. This is achieved through a mixture of specific incantations, ceremonial practices (such as the formation of ritual circles and the use of enchanted talismans), sacrifices, and a clear visualization of the Monstrosities' forms in the participants' minds.

3. **Command**: With the conduit established, the collective will of the practitioners must be focused on asserting control over the summoned Monstrosities. Incantations, particularly in ancient languages or occult dialects, are vitally important in this stage, as they act as binding agents that enforce a temporary servitude upon the Monstrosities.

The specific incantations, symbols, and practices employed for engaging with Monstrosities often vary depending on the nature and classification of the entity in question. Some may require blood sacrifices, while others might need a ritual offering or a recitation of a specific set of invocations. The knowledge of these intricacies typically comes from the study of ancient grimoires and the experiences of past occult practitioners.

The potential ramifications of summoning and controlling Monstrosities within the physical realm are manifold and often perilous. While successful control can grant the practitioners power and the ability to manipulate the world around them, failures can result in grievous consequences. 

Should the practitioners lose control, the Monstrosities may break free of their bindings and wreak havoc upon the physical realm. The unleashed entities can cause widespread destruction, inflict suffering and madness upon any inhabitants, and even open portals to other realms, allowing even more malevolent beings to enter.

Moreover, practitioners themselves run the risk of becoming the target of these Monstrosities' wrath. In severe cases, they may lose their lives, become possessed or cursed, or suffer a torturous spiritual or mental torment. Hence, the performance of such rituals demands great care, caution, and self-awareness.

To summarize, harnessing the collective power of a group of occult practitioners to summon and control Monstrosities is an endeavor that involves deep knowledge, precise coordination, and unwavering commitment to its execution. Failure to adhere to these principles can lead to catastrophic consequences that have the potential to reshape the fabric of reality itself.
