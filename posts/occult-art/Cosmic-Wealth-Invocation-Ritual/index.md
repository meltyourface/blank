## Aurum Astralis - The Cosmic Wealth Invocation

### I. Invocation of Deities

1. In the presence of the resplendence of Fortuna, gracious goddess of luck and fortune, I call upon thee to bestow your divine favor.
2. I invoke the radiance of Lakshmi, enchanting goddess of wealth and prosperity, to fill my life with abundant riches.

### II. Incorporation of Occult Symbols and Sigils

1. Engrave or draw the Sigil of Jupiter, mighty ruler of expansion, on a golden or brass medallion, to capture the energies of financial success.
2. Mark the Runes of Fehu and Algiz upon your palm or parchment, symbols of wealth and protection, to secure affluence and repel those who may seek to usurp it.

### III. Ceremonial Elements

1. Arrange the herbs of clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a circle, igniting their prosperity-attracting properties.
2. Charge the mystical crystals of citrine, green aventurine, and pyrite within the ceremonial space, magnifying wealth-drawing vibrations.
3. Anoint thyself and the Sigil of Jupiter with the sacred oils of patchouli, bergamot, and orange, sealing the serendipity of fateful wealth.

### IV. Astrological Timing and Correspondences

1. Prepare the ceremonial space during the waxing phase of the moon, when lunar energies favor growth and abundance.
2. Coordinate the casting of the spell with the ingress of Jupiter into its ruling sign of Sagittarius, maximizing the potential for prosperity and good fortune.

### V. Arcane Gestures and Prose

1. Raise thy hands to the heavens, forming the mudra of Ganesha, opening the doors to wealth and removing obstacles.
2. Recite the incantation, whispered with the reverence of arcane secrets:

"By the divine intercession of Fortuna and Lakshmi,
Bound in eternal harmony with celestial alchemy,
I conjure the cosmic forces that govern wealth and prosperity,
Focused and amplified within this blessed ceremony.

With every symbol, sigil, and rune inscribed,
Their unyielding power invoked, I shall imbibe,
May the planets align and yield their favor,
Pouring abundance upon me, for me now to savor.

Ignited in these sacred herbs, crystals, and oils,
A vortex of riches conjured, the cosmos toils,
Thus, I evoke the mysteries of the Aurum Astralis,
Radiating wealth unto me, now boundless and endless."

Upon the successful completion of the Aurum Astralis, the practitioner will find themselves in league with the powerful cosmic energies of wealth and prosperity, aiding in their journey towards the attainment of affluence and unlocking hidden potential.
