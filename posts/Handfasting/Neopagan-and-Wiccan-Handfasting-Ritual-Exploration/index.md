## Handfasting – A Neopagan and Wiccan Tradition

Introduction

Handfasting is an ancient ritual that symbolizes the binding together of two people in a spiritual union. With its roots in various cultural and religious traditions, it has been widely adopted in modern neopagan and Wiccan practices. In this chapter, we will explore the rich history and symbolic meanings of the Handfasting ceremony, discuss the key components and steps involved, delve into the role of the officiant, and examine the spiritual significance of the Handfasting cord or ribbon.

### I. History and Evolution of Handfasting

Handfasting dates back thousands of years to the ancient Celts, who practiced this sacred ceremony as a pivotal rite of passage and an essential part of their pre-Christian marriage customs. As Celtic tribes spread across Europe, variations of Handfasting became more prevalent in different societies. The ritual gradually evolved through time, entering different spiritual practices such as neopaganism and Wicca. The term ‘handfasting’ itself originates from Old Norse 'handfesta' meaning ‘to strike a bargain by joining hands’ or Anglo-Saxon ‘handfæstan,’ referring to the literal joining of hands as a pledge or agreement.

In medieval Europe, Handfasting ceremonies were recognized as legally binding marriages in some regions, while in others, they functioned as a betrothal period preceding a church wedding. The tradition faded in popularity with the rise of Christianity but experienced a resurgence in the 20th century, particularly among neopagan and Wiccan practitioners seeking to reconnect with ancient customs and honor the spiritual essence of union.

### II. Symbolic Meanings in Handfasting

The essence of Handfasting lies in its symbolic representation of unity, commitment, and the joining of two individuals' life paths. The ceremony represents the spiritual and emotional bonds formed when two partners come together in love and trust. As they bind their hands together with a cord or ribbon, the couple is reminded of their support for one another and their shared commitment to their partnership. This act of unity creates an intertwining of energies that results in powerful spiritual and emotional bonds.

### III. Key Components and Steps of the Handfasting Ceremony

A typical Handfasting ceremony begins with an invocation of the elements, gods, goddesses, or ancestral spirits, depending on the couple's spiritual beliefs or the officiant's guidance. The couple usually shares their vows and expresses their intentions before their friends, family, and spiritual deities.

The central component and most recognizable aspect of the ceremony is the actual handfasting or tying of the couple's hands together. The couple's individual hands, typically right to right and left to left, are joined and bound with a cord or ribbon, symbolizing their connection and unity. As the hands are bound, the officiant or the couple recites words or phrases to represent their intentions and commitments.

Once the hands are bound, the officiant may perform other symbolic elements based on the couple's spiritual beliefs—for instance, a chalice made of silver, pewter, or wood, filled with wine or another celebratory drink, to represent the sharing of life’s pleasures. The couple takes steps around a circle or fire, sometimes accompanied by music and chanting, to seal their union and receive blessings.

The ceremony concludes with the removal of the cord or ribbon, demonstrating that the spiritual bond is internal and does not require a physical connection. Finally, the couple may exchange rings or other tokens of their commitment before sharing a celebratory kiss.

### IV. The Officiant's Role in Handfasting

An officiant, or spiritual guide, plays a significant role in guiding the couple through their Handfasting ceremony. This individual may be a High Priest or Priestess, a legally recognized minister, or simply a trusted friend or family member well-versed in the practice. The officiant's responsibilities include facilitating the ritual, invoking deities or spiritual beings, assisting in the tying of the hands, reciting blessings and prayers, and leading the couple and their guests through other ceremonial components as needed.

### V. Significance of the Handfasting Cord or Ribbon

The Handfasting cord or ribbon is an essential component of the ceremony, symbolizing the binding together of the couple in love and commitment. The cord or ribbon is an expression of their shared life path and the intertwining of their energies. Specific colors and materials hold various meanings within different spiritual traditions and may be selected based on the couple's preferences and beliefs. The length of the cord or ribbon is also significant, with common lengths being 3, 6, or 9 feet, as these numbers are considered to hold spiritual power in various traditions.

Conclusion

In summary, Handfasting is an ancient ceremony with rich historical and symbolic roots. Its practice in neopagan and Wiccan traditions emphasizes the spiritual bond between partners, offering an intimate and meaningful way of expressing love, commitment, and unity. By understanding the historical context, symbolic meanings, key components, and the intricacies of the ritual, initiates can gain a deep appreciation for the sacred nature of Handfasting and its role in honoring the spiritual essence of union.
