To begin the exorcism, we must first establish a sacred space where the ceremony will take place. This area should be cleansed and protected with a mix of salt and herbs like sage, rosemary, and frankincense to ward off negative energy. A protective circle should be drawn around the space using chalk or salt to create a boundary for the entity.

At the center of the space, place a small table or altar with the essential holy tools needed for the exorcism: a crucifix, a vial of holy water, and a censer with blessed incense. Take a few moments to center yourself in prayer and gather the strength and resolve necessary to carry out this ritual.

Begin the exorcism by initiating contact with the malevolent spirit. In a respectful but authoritative tone, address the entity:

"In the name of the Holy Trinity, I command you, unclean spirit, to reveal yourself to me. I call upon the power of God to compel you to acknowledge your presence and obediently heed my commands."

Next, recite several traditional Latin chants to assert your spiritual authority over the entity:

"Exorcizo te, immundissime spiritus, in nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis, et in nomine Jesu Christi Filii ejus, Domini et Judicis nostri, et in virtute Spiritus Sancti, ut discedas ab hoc plasmate Dei N., quod Dominus noster ad templum sanctum suum vocare dignatus est, ut fiat templum Dei vivi, et Spiritus Sanctus habitet in eo."

"Illuminate your servant and expel this wicked spirit from them. In Christ's name, set them free!"

As the exorcism progresses, the malevolent spirit may exhibit resistance or manifest in unexpected ways. Be prepared to adapt your approach as necessary. If the entity makes its presence known through physical phenomena or attempts to provoke fear, continue to project calm authority and maintain the protective circle. Sprinkle holy water in the direction of any disturbances while reciting:

"Aspersiónes tuæ, Dómine, terrébunt eum, et vínum benedíctum damnátis ejus fundátur: quóniam tu síleris, Deus, peccáta, et non potest in pœnam írasci."

In moments of heightened resistance, hold the crucifix aloft and pray:

"Sancte Michael Archangele, defende nos in proelio. Contra nequitiam et insidias diaboli esto praesidium. Imperet illi Deus, supplices deprecamur. Tuque, Princeps militiae caelestis, Satanam aliosque spiritus malignos, qui ad perditionem animarum pervagantur in mundo divina virtute in infernum detrude. Amen."

Persist in your chants and prayer, repeating these steps, maintaining the protective circle, and consistently employing the crucifix, holy water, and blessed incense until the demon is entirely banished from the afflicted individual.

As the exorcism concludes, give thanks to God for the strength and wisdom to carry out this sacred duty and protect those present. Close the ritual by calling upon archangels and guardian spirits to maintain the sanctity of the space and ensure a lasting peace:

"By the authority of the Holy Trinity and the grace of God, I declare this space cleansed and protected. May the archangels and heavenly guardians watch over it and all who dwell here. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen."

Finally, cleanse the room with sage or rosemary incense, erase the protective circle, and leave the area, confident in a successful exorcism and the lasting safeguard from malevolent spirits.
