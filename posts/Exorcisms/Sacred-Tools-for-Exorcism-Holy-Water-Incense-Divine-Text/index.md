  In the context of exorcisms, describe the symbolic significance and practical application of three sacred tools used during the ritual, while considering the influences of ancient spiritual practices, cultural beliefs, and the interconnectedness of the initiates' own spiritual orientation.

The practice of exorcism, deeply rooted in various religious and spiritual practices, aims to expel malevolent entities and negative energies from a person, place, or object. Throughout its long history, practitioners have employed a diverse array of sacred tools to facilitate the effectiveness of the exorcism ritual. The symbolic significance of these tools is influenced by ancient spiritual practices, cultural beliefs, and the interconnectedness of the initiate’s spiritual orientation. In this response, I shall discuss three critical sacred tools commonly used in exorcisms: Holy Water, Sacred Incense, and the Divine Text.

1. Holy Water:
Holy water is a vital sacred tool in exorcism rituals, symbolizing purity, protection, and spiritual power. This potent element has its roots in various ancient spiritual practices. For instance, in Hinduism, water from the Ganges river is considered sacred and is used in rituals, while in ancient Egypt, the Nile river's water was regarded as an essential aspect of purification rites. 

In Christian exorcism practices, holy water is made by combining purified water with blessed salt. This process infuses the liquid with spiritual energies, making it an effective weapon against malevolent entities. It is believed that holy water's application on a person or place can cleanse and purify, which helps in breaking any harmful spiritual connections and negative energies that may be present. The symbolism of water as a source of life, renewal, and spiritual power amplifies the potency of this sacred tool, making it an important aspect of exorcism rituals across various spiritual orientations.

2. Sacred Incense:
Incense has been used for millennia in diverse cultures and religions to purify spaces and invoke divine power. Sacred incense's symbolic significance in exorcism rituals is complex, as its origins derive from various ancient practices that emphasize the importance of maintaining spiritual balance and harmony.

Many cultures perceive the fragrant smoke produced by burning incense as an extension of prayers or invocations to the spiritual realm, thus connecting the physical and the metaphysical worlds. The choice of a particular incense in an exorcism ritual may be influenced by the practitioner's spiritual orientation, regional availability of the ingredients, or cultural beliefs regarding the incense's specific protective qualities and powers.

Practically, the burning of sacred incense during the exorcism ritual is employed to cleanse the space and create a barrier against malevolent forces. This purification process can weaken or disrupt the connections between the affected individual and the negative entities, thereby facilitating the exorcism's effectiveness.

3. The Divine Text:
The Divine Text refers to sacred scriptures or holy writings employed during exorcism rituals. These texts can vary significantly based on the practitioner's spiritual orientation and cultural background. Examples include the Bible (Christianity), the Quran (Islam), or the Vedas (Hinduism). The symbolic significance of a Divine Text lies in its representation of the divine and ultimate Truth, which empowers the practitioner in their battle against malevolent entities.

In exorcism rituals, the Divine Text serves both as a source of authority for the exorcist and a powerful tool in confronting the malevolent entity. Often, exorcists will recite specific prayers or passages from the text, invoking divine assistance, and affirming their intention to expel the malevolent presence. The use of sacred language and sound frequencies in these recitations can contribute to the weakening and expulsion of the entity.

In summary, sacred tools used in exorcism rituals, such as Holy Water, Sacred Incense, and the Divine Text, carry profound symbolic significance and practical applications, influenced by ancient spiritual practices, cultural beliefs, and the practitioner's spiritual orientation. These tools help cleanse, purify and protect the person or place, thus facilitating the expulsion of malevolent entities and negative energies. The interconnectedness of the initiate’s spiritual orientation and the tools employed underline the rich diversity and universality of exorcism practices across various cultures and religious traditions.
