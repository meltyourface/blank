To fully understand the Voltigeurs and their historical significance, it is important to first delve into their origins, their specialized training, and the specific ways they were deployed in battlefields. As you journey through this analysis, you will unearth connections between these skilled forces and the esoteric and occult realms, illuminating a deeper understanding of their true purpose and inherent knowledge.

Origins of the Voltigeurs:
The Voltigeurs began as an elite light infantry unit in the early 19th century, under the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte. Their name, derived from the French word 'voltiger', meaning 'to leap or vault,' does not solely represent their agility and physical prowess. It also hints at their connection to the esotericism symbolized by the leaping figure commonly observed in tarot cards, representing sudden realizations or hidden wisdom.

Formation and organization:
The Voltigeurs were assembled from the best and most adaptable soldiers in Napoleon's army. They were often the smallest and nimblest members, enabling them to move quickly and maneuver through different terrains with ease. This physical attribute is noteworthy, as it symbolizes the idea of "as above, so below" in Hermeticism, which emphasizes the connection between the spiritual and physical realms. Their formation and hierarchical organization echo occult institutions such as the Freemasons, knighthood, or the Rosicrucians, all of which sought to cultivate their members' innate hidden talents and abilities to unlock deeper wisdom and insight.

Specialized training:
Voltigeurs were expert marksmen, rigging artists, and scouts, and they underwent rigorous physical and mental training to hone their specialized skills. Through esoteric lenses, this training can be seen as a form of initiation, similar to the transformative processes experienced by students in mystery schools or occult orders. This transformative process, often involving trials and tests, allowed the Voltigeurs to sharpen their focus, attune to their inner strength, and wield specialized knowledge in the courses of their scouting and combat missions.

Deployment in battles:
In the heat of battle, the Voltigeurs were typically deployed as the vanguard or the rear-guard of Napoleon's armies, engaging in intricate and daring maneuvers to outwit the enemy. The Voltigeurs' tactics often involved creative strategies, secret ambushes, and rapid hit-and-run operations to confuse and demoralize the enemy. Such tactics might represent the idea of hidden knowledge and mastery over the unseen forces, as found in occultism.

Interconnectedness and underlying occult principles:
Through this analysis, we can perceive the interconnectedness between the Voltigeurs' formation, training, deployment, and the realms of esotericism and occultism. Their role as an elite force signified their possession of, and access to, exclusive knowledge known only to the most advanced initiates. It is evident that the Voltigeurs were not merely soldiers; behind their exterior, the unit represented the application of esoteric and occult principles to the art of warfare.

In conclusion, when studying the Voltigeurs, it is vital to recognize their connection to esotericism and occultism, which uncovers a deeper layer of understanding about their true purpose and inherent knowledge. The themes of the interconnectedness between the physical and spiritual realms, initiation processes, and hidden wisdom that permeate their origins, training, and deployment provide a rich context for understanding the Voltigeurs as more than just an agile unit of Napoleon's army. Instead, they become a symbol of the pursuit of mastery and deeper understanding, embodying the principles and ideas inherent in the esoteric and occult traditions.
