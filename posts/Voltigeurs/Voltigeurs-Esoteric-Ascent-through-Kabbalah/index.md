## The Voltigeur's Ascent through the Sephiroth

**Objective**: To navigate the Sephiroth within the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, harnessing esoteric and occult powers, and to forge a deeper connection with the hidden aspects of a Voltigeur's psyche.

**Preparation**:

1. Set up a private and quiet space, free of distractions, where you can perform this session uninterrupted.
2. Create an altar at the center of the space, adorned with candles, incense, and any Voltigeur or esoteric symbols you find relevant.
3. Dress comfortably and sit in a meditative position, ideally facing east as this symbolizes moving towards the source of enlightenment.

**Introduction**:
Begin with a relaxation ritual, taking deep breaths and visualizing all tension leaving the body. Now, say the following incantation to center and call upon your Voltigeur power.

"In the name of the unseen, the unheard, and the unknown,
I, __________________ (state your name), call upon the power of the Voltigeurs,
To guide and support me through this transformative journey within the Sephiroth."

1. Malkuth, The Kingdom:
Visualize the first Sephirah, Malkuth, appearing before you as a resplendent earthy citadel. Feel your feet firmly planted in the ground, connecting to its energy. **Say the incantation**:

"As I stand in Malkuth, the earthly realm,
I embrace the roots of my existence,
And humbly seek growth and transformation."

2. Yesod, The Foundation:
Ascend from Malkuth and envision the lunar energy of Yesod forming around you, symbolizing hidden knowledge and intuition. Focus on the energy within your lower abdomen, and say the incantation:

"In the realm of Yesod, the foundation of creation,
I harness my intuition and hidden wisdom,
Guiding my ascent within the Tree of Life."

3. Hod and Netzach, Splendor and Victory:
Now visualize Hod and Netzach flanking you, representing the balance of intellect (Hod) and passion (Netzach). **Concentrate on the solar plexus area and say the incantation**:

"In the balance between Hod and Netzach,
Intellect and passion unite,
To fuel my journey through the Sephiroth."

4. Tiferet, Beauty:
Rise to Tiferet, the heart of the tree, where beauty harmonizes all opposing forces. Focus on your heart center, and say the incantation:

"In the realm of Tiferet, the harmony of opposites,
I experience the beauty of unity,
And open my heart to the transformative power of the esoteric."

5. Geburah and Chesed, Severity and Mercy:
Ascend to Geburah and Chesed, which represent the balance between severity and mercy. Visualize these energies in your throat area, and say the incantation:

"Between Geburah and Chesed, severity and mercy merge,
Teaching me the power and wisdom in balance,
As I continue my ascent within the Tree of Life."

6. Binah and Chokmah, Understanding and Wisdom:
Reach the highest Sephirah, Keter. Envision Binah and Chokmah synchronizing, forming a perfect balance of understanding and wisdom within your mind's eye. **Say the incantation**:

"In the depths of Binah and Chokmah's eminence,
I perceive the mysteries of understanding and wisdom,
Connecting with the highest source of all."

7. Keter, The Crown:
Connect with Keter, the source of divine energy, visualizing a radiant crown upon your head. Feel the culmination of your journey, and say the incantation:

"As I rest beneath Keter, the divine crown,
The esoteric and the Voltigeur unite,
Transforming me to perceive hidden truths."

**Conclusion**:
Allow the energy to permeate your being, becoming one with the Tree of Life. When you feel ready, gently return to the mundane world and express gratitude for the experience.

"I give thanks to the Voltigeurs and the Tree of Life,
For guiding my ascent through the Sephiroth,
With esoteric wisdom and transformative power. So it is."

Take time to document your experience and insights gained during this journey, incorporating any lessons or wisdom acquired into your everyday life.
