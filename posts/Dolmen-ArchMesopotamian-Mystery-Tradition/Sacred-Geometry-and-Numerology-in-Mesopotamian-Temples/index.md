  To complete the task, I will investigate the influence of sacred geometry and numerology in the construction and symbolic significance of Mesopotamian temples, specifically within the Dolmen ArchMesopotamian Mystery Tradition, by delving into the architectural plans and ritualistic practices associated with the tradition. I will compare three different temple examples: the Temple of Enki in Eridu, the Ziggurat of Ur, and the Ishtar Temple in Babylon. 
  
  1. Temple of Enki in Eridu:
  The Temple of Enki, dedicated to the Sumerian god of water and wisdom, represents the archetype of the sacred temple in Mesopotamian culture. The main geometrical figure evident in its construction is the square, which was associated with the concept of stability and solidity in both sacred geometry and numerology. The temple is divided into four main sections, each representing one of the four elements – earth, water, air, and fire – fundamental to the Dolmen ArchMesopotamian Mystery Tradition. In this temple, we find the sacred number 7, often linked to the divine realm and the seven planetary spheres. This number is evident in the seven stages of initiation and the seven chambers that align the temple's central axis.
  
  2. Ziggurat of Ur:
  The Ziggurat of Ur, dedicated to the moon god Nanna, is a prime example of a Mesopotamian step pyramid. This temple showcases the triadic principle that underpins the sacred geometry within the Dolmen ArchMesopotamian Mystery Tradition. Its three tiers represent the celestial, terrestrial, and infernal realms, reflecting the belief in the interconnectedness of all existence. The sacred number 3, resonating with the triadic principle, is omnipresent in the temple's design, with each tier containing numerous triple divisions, such as the three sanctuaries found at each level. Additionally, the number 12 plays a significant role in the temple's design, as there are 12 steps leading to the main terrace. In Mesopotamian numerology, 12 signifies the cycle of time and is often linked to the lunar calendar.
  
  3. Ishtar Temple in Babylon:
  The Ishtar Temple, dedicated to the goddess of love and fertility, showcases a unique approach to the integration of sacred geometry and numerology. The primary geometric shape present in its construction is the octagon, which symbolizes balance, renewal, and the bridging of spiritual and material worlds. In Mesopotamian numerology, the number 8 resonates with abundance, fertility, and prosperity. Ishtar's temple also features the sacred number 11, representing the balance between the divine and human realms, as there are 11 entrance gates surrounding the complex.
  
  In conclusion, the Dolmen ArchMesopotamian Mystery Tradition showcases a profound understanding of sacred geometry and numerology in the construction of its temples. While each temple has unique features, they share similarities in their incorporation of sacred numbers and geometrical patterns that represent metaphysical concepts and interconnections within the cosmos. These patterns not only reveal the tradition's intricate belief system but also play a crucial role in the performance of rituals and practices associated with the Dolmen ArchMesopotamian Mystery Tradition.
