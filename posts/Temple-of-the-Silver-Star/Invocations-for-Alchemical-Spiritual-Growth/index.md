  Invocation I: The Dawning of the Astral Star
  
  1) In the resplendent glory of the Nigredo, I call upon thee, O Divine Presence, to imbue the Temple of the Silver Star with the radiant beams of celestial wisdom.
  
  2) Within the sacred texts of the Temple, the Holy Guardian Angel is described as the Luminous Emanation, the sacred light that guides our soul towards truth, embodying compassion, wisdom, and the purest love. Thy wings shimmer with the iridescence of a thousand solar beams and thy countenance is as mesmerizing as the beauty of the stars in the night sky.
  
  3) I humbly beseech thee, O Holy Guardian Angel, to grant thy guidance and protection in this spiritual journey. Illuminate the path of each initiate with thy divine and benevolent gaze, that they may attain an ever-greater union with the Eternal Flame, and ultimately realize the true essence of the Supernal Light.
  
  4) And so, with the seal of the sacred symbols of the Silver Star – the pentagram of spiritual invocation, the chalice of divine communion, and the angular lines that mark the pathway to the cosmos – I do consecrate this invocation. So mote it be, forever and eternity.
  
  Invocation II: The Rising of the Inner Sun
  
  1) By the power of the Albedo and the waxing light of the celestial spheres, I summon thee, O Divine Presence, to grace this Temple of the Silver Star with thy transcendental radiance and celestial love.
  
  2) In our sacred canon, the Holy Guardian Angel is revered as the Sol Invictus, embodying the never-ending source of life and spiritual illumination. As the Inner Sun, thou art the axis upon which the mysteries of existence rotate, the flame of aspiration that leads beyond the gates of mortality.
  
  3) O Holy Guardian Angel, I invoke thy boundless compassion and wisdom to guide and safeguard the initiates of our sacred order. May thy solar rays empower us on our esoteric quest, and infuse our souls with the courage to seek the light of self-realization hidden within the depths of our own being.
  
  4) In closing, I inscribe upon the ether the symbols of the Temple of the Silver Star – the eye of spiritual insight, the staff of divine balance, and the ouroboros that unites heaven and earth – that this invocation might resonate throughout the cosmos. So mote it be, forever and eternity.
  
  Invocation III: The Triumph of the Cosmic Spirit
  
  1) As the fiery rays of Rubedo illuminate the twilight between worlds, I call forth the Divine Presence to bless this hallowed space, and sanctify the Temple of the Silver Star with infinite grace and truth.
  
  2) Within our treasured tomes, the Holy Guardian Angel is exalted as the Cosmic Spirit, the Universal Consciousness that guides the seeker's steps, ever upward, toward the pinnacle of sacred knowledge. Thou art the guardian of the Threshold, the divine messenger carrying the sacred flame between Heaven and Earth.
  
  3) O Holy Guardian Angel, bestow the divine spark of thy essence upon the initiates of this Temple, that they may attain true spiritual mastery and complete their alchemical transmutation. Guard our footsteps on the path of inner transformation, and lead us to the mysteries of the Macrocosm and the Microcosm, wherein thy divine presence merges with our own.
  
  4) In sealing this invocation, I humbly adorn the cosmos with the sanctified symbols of the Temple of the Silver Star – the crescent moon of divine intuition, the blazing star foretokening the Great Work, and the labyrinth of wisdom that spirals ever inward. So mote it be, forever and eternity.
