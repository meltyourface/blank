The chosen alchemical emblem for this deep analysis is the Red Lion, also known as "Rubedo" or "the red stage." This emblem is a key component within the magickal and alchemical practices of the Temple of the Silver Star and is linked to the temple's esoteric and transformative teachings.

Origins and History:
The Red Lion dates back to the medieval era, commonly found within esoteric and alchemical manuscripts as well as grimoires. It represents the final stage of the alchemical Magnum Opus (Great Work) and the transmutation of base substances into gold, symbolizing spiritual transformation and the realization of the true Self. 

Layered Meanings:
Within the practice of the Temple of the Silver Star, the Red Lion is viewed as a symbol of inner transformation and the divine union between the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the divine or universal consciousness). Its presence in the temple reflects the core teaching that one must undergo a process of self-discovery and spiritual awakening to attain the illumination that is inherent within the temple's name.

The Red Lion is often depicted devouring the Sun, representing the union of opposites, such as the Masculine and Feminine principles, the active and passive elements, and the ego and the Higher Self. As the integration of these polarities allows for enlightenment, the devouring symbolizes an inner process of self-mastery and the realization of one's potential.

Influences on Contemporary Occultism:
The Red Lion has become a widely recognized emblem within various contemporary esoteric schools, including Thelema, incorporating it into their systems of magick and initiation. Prominent adepts of the Temple of the Silver Star widen the knowledge on the Red Lion, linking it to different stages of their personal spiritual journey, and crafting rituals and invocations centered around this emblem to aid in their transformative work.

In conclusion, the Red Lion holds great significance within the Temple of the Silver Star, serving as a constant reminder of the student's potential for spiritual transformation and the inherent divine nature within each individual.
