To properly delve into the connections between Tarot symbolism, divine-human hybrids in mythologies, and P.T. Barnum's Feejee Mermaid, we must first break down each of these components and understand their individual significance before exploring their interconnectedness.

**Tarot Symbolism:**

The Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, each bearing intricate and symbolic imagery representing various aspects of the material, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of life. The deck is primarily utilized for divination, reflection, and meditation purposes, but it goes beyond mere fortune-telling. Tarot symbolism acts as a mirror to the human condition, exploring life's mysteries, our deepest desires, and our subconscious fears. The cards depict characters and archetypes that anyone can relate to, and their imagery taps into the collective unconscious, a concept introduced by Carl Jung, referring to the shared memories, experiences, and symbols of humankind.

**Divine-Human Hybrids in Mythologies:**

Throughout human history and across numerous cultures, myths have featured divine-human hybrids, beings part-human, part-divine, or part-animal, reflecting both the aspirations and anxieties of people. These hybrids, like centaurs (half-human, half-horse) or mermaids (half-human, half-fish), represented the bridge between the human and the divine, forcing individuals to reconsider the limits of human existence. They symbolized the complexity and duality of nature and sparked human curiosity, ultimately inspiring stories, artwork, and religious beliefs. These mythical beings challenged the status quo of what defines humanity and its boundaries, providing spiritual and philosophical lessons through their existence and experiences.

**P.T. **Barnum's Feejee Mermaid**:**

In the 19th century, P.T. Barnum, an American businessman and showman, displayed a potentially fabricated creature called the Feejee Mermaid, which was purportedly a half-fish, half-human creature. This exhibit fascinated and horrified audiences, captivating the public's imagination. The mermaid represented not only the allure of the unknown but also the power of human desire to believe in the existence of such creatures. This curiosity towards "Freaks" manifested as both fear and fascination, and Barnum's display played with these emotions, as it simultaneously showcased the enigmatic and absurd aspects of human nature.

**Connections between Tarot, Mythology, and the Feejee Mermaid:**

Now that we have a brief understanding of each individual component, we can delve into how they all intertwine.

1. **Challenging Societal Norms**: All three components serve to challenge societal norms by questioning the conventional notions of reality and human existence. Tarot tackles this challenge by providing introspective glimpses into the subconscious, while mythological figures represent the juncture of the human and the divine. Meanwhile, the Feejee Mermaid acted as a blatant challenge to societal norms, intentionally provoking discussions about the limits of human understanding and beliefs.

2. **Evoking Human Psyche**: Both Tarot and mythological divine-human hybrids provide insight into the emotions, values, desires, and fears of the human psyche. Tarot does this through archetypical imagery and introspective explorations, while divine-human hybrids encapsulate the simultaneous wonder and anxiety that humans contend with in relation to their own existence and the world around them. The Feejee Mermaid, as a "Freak," played on similar fears and fascinations, tapping into the curiosity about what lurked beyond the known world.

3. **Symbolism and Storytelling**: Each of these elements employs symbolism and storytelling as vehicles to communicate deeper truths about ourselves. The Tarot uses intricate visual symbols that relate to various aspects of life and emotions. Mythological divine-human hybrids are rich with symbolism that weaves seamlessly into the stories. The Feejee Mermaid represents an amalgamation of cultural symbols and narratives, ultimately becoming a symbol of both human curiosity and skepticism.

**In conclusion,** the connections between Tarot symbolism, mythological divine-human hybrids, and P.T. Barnum's Feejee Mermaid lie in their abilities to challenge societal norms, evoke hidden layers of the human psyche, and utilize symbolism and storytelling to communicate deeper truths. All three components inspire introspection, curiosity, and a reevaluation of the nature of human existence and our understanding of reality. By examining these connections, we gain a richer understanding of how the human psyche and cultural constructs play out in our curious search for meaning and self-discovery.
