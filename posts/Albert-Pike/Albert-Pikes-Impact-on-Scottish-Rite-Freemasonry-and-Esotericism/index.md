Albert Pike's views and contributions were primarily focused on Freemasonry, with a special emphasis on the Scottish Rite branch of the organization. Pike was a Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite's Southern Jurisdiction, which allowed him to make significant contributions to its development.

One of Pike's most significant achievements was the development of rituals for the Scottish Rite, which were adopted by many lodges under the jurisdiction of the Southern Supreme Council. Through his work, Pike modernized Freemasonry's rituals, making them more relevant and accessible to those who may not have been able to grasp the significance of the old rituals.

Another crucial aspect of Pike's legacy is his authorship of "Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry." This tome seeks to explain the philosophies and symbolism behind the rituals of Freemasonry, with an emphasis on the esoteric and mystical aspects of the order. For many Freemasons, "Morals and Dogma" serves as a core text for understanding the teachings and principles of their fraternity.

It is worth noting that while Pike did not found the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, his influence can be seen in the formation and development of many modern Western occult movements. At the same time, Pike did have an interest in astrology, alchemy, and various other esoteric pursuits. However, these areas were not his primary focus nor did they define his most notable contributions to occultism and Freemasonry.

In conclusion, Albert Pike's primary contribution to the world of esotericism and occultism was through his work with the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, especially when it comes to the creation and modernization of rituals, as well as the authorship of the important book "Morals and Dogma." These contributions continue to shape and influence the development of Freemasonry and Western esotericism.
