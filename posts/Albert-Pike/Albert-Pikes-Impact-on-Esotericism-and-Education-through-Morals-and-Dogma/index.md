To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the key elements mentioned and their relationships. **The elements are**: Albert Pike's "Morals and Dogma," his writings on Freemasonry, the 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite, and their connections to both occultism and education in the 19th century. **To approach this challenge, we will divide the discussion into three sections**: 

1. The contents of "Morals and Dogma" and its esoteric teachings
2. The Scottish Rite and its 33 degrees of Freemasonry
3. The impact of these teachings and structures on occultism and education in the 19th century.

### Section 1: The contents of "Morals and Dogma" and its esoteric teachings

"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry," published in 1871, is perhaps the most well-known work of Albert Pike (1809-1891). As a prominent Freemason and influential leader of the Scottish Rite in the United States, Pike aimed to collect and synthesize a vast array of esoteric and philosophical knowledge into one cohesive text. Among the key themes in "Morals and Dogma" are the exploration of symbols, metaphysics, and the human experience through the lens of various mystic and esoteric traditions.

In the book, Pike emphasized the importance of symbolism as a means to communicate profound and interconnected truths. Drawing from ancient cultures, Pike showed how symbols were utilized not only for their aesthetic value but also as part of a complex language that could guide spiritual and intellectual growth. Additionally, the text explores metaphysics and its relationship to human nature, asserting that there is a hidden truth beyond our physical senses, waiting to be discovered.

### Section 2: The Scottish Rite and its 33 degrees of Freemasonry

The Scottish Rite constitutes one of the most philosophically and ritually complex branches of Freemasonry. It spans 33 degrees, each representing a stage of initiation or spiritual advancement. Pike, as a prominent Freemason, was deeply involved in the organization and development of the Scottish Rite, particularly in the United States. His work on "Morals and Dogma" was intended as a comprehensive guide to the degrees and their teachings.

The structure and content of the Scottish Rite reflect a syncretic approach to esoteric teachings, incorporating elements from various world traditions, such as the Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and ancient Egyptian and Greek mythology. This approach allowed for the exploration of common themes, such as the human condition, the nature of divinity, and moral and ethical development.

### Section 3: The impact of these teachings and structures on occultism and education in the 19th century

Pike's writings and contributions to both "Morals and Dogma" and the Scottish Rite had a significant impact on the advancement of occultism and esotericism during the 19th century. At the time, it was an era of burgeoning interest in mysticism and alternative spiritualities, partly inspired by the increasing availability of global knowledge. Pike's work on synthesizing various esoteric and philosophical teachings into an organized structure made these ideas more accessible and appealing to a wider audience, thus promoting their prominence within Western culture.

Additionally, the complex relationship between symbolism, metaphysics, and human experience elucidated by Pike's work had a profound effect on how people approached education and self-development. Not only were the Scottish Rite's degrees seen as a way of achieving personal enlightenment, but also as a means of fostering moral and ethical growth. This understanding of education went beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge to incorporate personal introspection and an understanding of the interconnected nature of reality.

In conclusion, Albert Pike's work in "Morals and Dogma" and his contributions to the development of the Scottish Rite in Freemasonry reflect his significant influence on the advancement of occultism and esotericism in the 19th century. The emphasis on symbolism, metaphysics, and human experience in his writings helped to elucidate the complex relationship between these areas, further propelling interest in spiritual exploration. Additionally, the impact of these teachings on education and self-development is evident in the focus on personal introspection and moral growth in the Scottish Rite's degree system.
