Albert Pike was a highly influential and multifaceted figure in the realms of Freemasonry, occultism, and education. His contributions spanned across a range of subjects and disciplines, including law, literature, Native American languages and culture, and higher education.

By choosing the option that highlights Pike as an "eclectic scholar of several subjects," we acknowledge his comprehensive impact and the broad scope of his work. While he did author "Morals and Dogma," and he was a prominent Freemason who achieved the highest level of Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite's Southern Jurisdiction, it is crucial to understand the full breadth of his knowledge and interests. These interests and pursuits were woven into his Freemasonry work and his exploration of the occult.

Additionally, it is important to note that his association with the Ku Klux Klan remains a contested issue. Though some sources suggest he was involved in its creation, others claim that these allegations are historically unfounded and misleading. Regardless of the ambiguity surrounding this aspect of Pike's life, it does not fully capture the essence of his contributions to occultism, Freemasonry, and education.

To better understand the reasoning behind the chosen answer, it is essential to delve deeper into Pike's work and background. Born in 1809, Albert Pike displayed a keen interest in various intellectual pursuits, even as a young man. After several years of exploring the American frontier, Pike returned to formal education and became a prominent lawyer and newspaper editor.

This love for learning led Pike to study various subjects beyond his professional expertise, such as archaeology, classical literature, and the esoteric. It was probably his deep connection with Native American tribes that influenced his interest in the occult and the philosophy behind rituals and spiritual systems, further illustrating the connection between his wide-ranging knowledge and his work in Freemasonry and the occult.

Pike played a significant role in reframing the Scottish Rite rituals, drawing on ancient traditions and incorporating symbolism from different eras and cultures, while also addressing the philosophical and moral aspects of Freemasonry. This greatly contributed to the modern understanding and appreciation of Freemasonry, as well as its ties to the occult and the deep spiritual wisdom that it encodes.

In conclusion, it is Pike's status as an "eclectic scholar" that best reflects the totality of his contributions to Freemasonry, occultism, and education. His broad range of interests and expertise, combined with his insatiable curiosity, informed his work in these fields and allowed him to make lasting contributions that continue to be celebrated and studied today.
