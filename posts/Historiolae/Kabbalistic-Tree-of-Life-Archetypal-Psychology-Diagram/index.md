In order to develop an intricate diagram illustrating the nuanced associations between the Sephiroth on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life and their corresponding human psychological archetypes within the domain of Historiolae, let us first briefly review the fundamental aspects of the Tree of Life and the ten Sephiroth it comprises.

The Kabbalistic Tree of Life is a central symbol in the mystical Jewish tradition of Kabbalah, which represents the nature of divinity and the structure of the universe. It consists of ten interconnected nodes called Sephiroth, arranged in three columns, which represent divine emanations and various aspects of human psychology.

1. Keter (Crown): This Sephirah represents the primordial divine will and the origin of creation. It corresponds to the human psychological archetype of the pure, unknowable essence that drives existence and consciousness.

2. Chokhmah (Wisdom): Chokhmah symbolizes divine wisdom and the initial spark of creation. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the wise old man, embodying insight, intuition, and foresight.

3. Binah (Understanding): Often seen as a counterpart to Chokhmah, Binah represents divine understanding and the ability to discern and analyze. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the nurturing mother, embodying empathy, compassion, and protective care.

4. Chesed (Kindness): This Sephirah represents divine mercy, love, and grace. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the benevolent father figure, who provides unconditional love and support.

5. Gevurah (Severity): Gevurah symbolizes divine judgment, discipline, and the ability to restrain negative forces. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the strict father or the warrior, embodying justice, courage, and the capacity to stand against evil.

6. Tiferet (Beauty): Tiferet represents balance, harmony, and 
the integration of the other Sephiroth. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the ideal self or the hero, who unites and transcends internal and external conflicts.

7. Netzach (Eternity): This Sephirah represents the divine aspect of endurance, persistence, and the will to overcome obstacles. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the passionate lover or the artist, who manifests beauty and inspiration through determination.

8. Hod (Splendor): Hod symbolizes divine intellect, communication, and the power of thought. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the scholar, thinker, or the magician, who masters knowledge and uses it to transform reality.

9. Yesod (Foundation): Yesod represents the divine foundation 
of the universe and the essential connection between the material and spiritual realms. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the mystic or the dreamer, who perceives and communicates with the higher realms hidden beyond ordinary consciousness.

10. Malkuth (Kingdom): The final Sephirah represents the material world and the culmination of divine creation. It corresponds to the psychological archetype of the Earth Mother, who nurtures, protects, and sustains life on earth.

Now, with a better understanding of these Sephiroth and their psychological archetypes, creating a detailed diagram would involve drawing the Tree of Life with the ten Sephiroth and adding annotations to describe the archetypes associated with each.

Additionally, exploring cross-cultural connections and underlying patterns within human psychology could be achieved by comparing the Tree of Life and the Sephiroth with similar symbols, systems, and archetypes found in other mystical or spiritual traditions, such as the Hindu chakra system, the Chinese concept of Qi, or the ancient Greek elements.

Through such a comprehensive analysis and diagram, the intricate and complex associations between the Sephiroth and human psychological archetypes within the domain of Historiolae can be better understood, revealing the timeless wisdom and universality of these sacred teachings.
