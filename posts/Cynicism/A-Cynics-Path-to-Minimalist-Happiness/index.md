By embracing the core Cynic principles of simplicity, self-sufficiency, and rejecting material wealth, you can achieve eudaimonia (happiness).

1. Core Cynic Teachings:
 a. Diogenes: Known for his extreme minimalism and rejection of societal norms, Diogenes insisted that one's virtue is solely determined by their actions, not their possessions.
   b. Antisthenes: A student of Socrates, Antisthenes emphasized the importance of self-discipline, moral character, and internal reflection over external validation.
   c. Crates of Thebes: Crates renounced his material wealth to live a simple life, asserting that true happiness stems from the pursuit of wisdom and understanding, rather than accumulating possessions.

2. Rejecting Material Wealth and Embracing Simplicity:

To achieve eudaimonia, it is essential to prioritize wisdom, simplicity, and contentment. By detaching from the pursuit of material wealth, we can focus on personal growth, self-mastery, and cultivating meaningful relationships.

3. A Step-by-Step Plan:

   a. Analyze your current lifestyle and identify areas of excess. Begin by decluttering and simplifying your possessions, retaining only what is truly necessary.
   
   b. Adopt a frugal mindset by focusing on mindful consumption and prioritizing experiences over material items.
   
   c. Develop self-sufficiency skills, such as cooking, gardening, and repairing items, to minimize reliance on external resources.
   
   d. Cultivate mindfulness and self-awareness through meditation and self-reflection, fostering a deep understanding of your beliefs and values.

4. Tangible Examples of Cynic Philosophers:

   a. Diogenes lived in a discarded clay jar, showcasing his commitment to voluntary poverty and utter rejection of material wealth.
   
   b. Antisthenes practiced asceticism by wearing minimal clothing and frequently walking barefoot, illustrating the importance of self-discipline and simplicity.
   
   c. Crates of Thebes gave away his possessions, opting for a life of voluntary poverty and demonstrating the necessity of prioritizing wisdom over material wealth.

5. Incorporating Cynic Principles into Daily Routines:

   a. Asceticism: Engage in regular fasting or choose simple meals to foster appreciation for basic sustenance.
   
   b. Self-discipline: Implement a daily exercise routine to improve physical and mental well-being and strengthen your resolve.
   
   c. Humor: Use humor to disarm tension and promote deeper understanding in social interactions.

6. Cultivating Mental Resilience:

   a. Develop a strong sense of self by continuously reflecting on your values and beliefs.
   
   b. Educate yourself on Cynic philosophy to reaffirm your commitment to the minimalist lifestyle.
   
   c. Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who share your values and can provide support during challenging moments.

7. Discussion Topics and Exercises for Self-Reflection:

   a. Evaluate the extent to which your possessions contribute to your happiness and assess their necessity in your life.
   
   b. Contemplate the societal norms you might be perpetuating and assess whether they align with your values as a Cynic-minimalist.
   
   c. Create a personal mission statement rooted in Cynic philosophy to reinforce your commitment to living deliberately and intentionally.

By following this guide, you can embark on a lifelong journey of Cynic-inspired minimalist living, cultivating a sense of eudaimonia through simplicity, self-sufficiency, and personal growth.
