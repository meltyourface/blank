The correct answer is: 
- A philosophical technique of retracing the origins of a theory or belief back to its elementary principles.

**Explanation**:

Ariadne's Thread refers to an ancient problem-solving heuristic that can be traced back to the myth of Ariadne and Theseus from Greek mythology. Ariadne provided Theseus with a thread to help him navigate the labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur. In occult studies, Ariadne's Thread is understood as a metaphor for an intellectual tool or approach used to unravel complexities and overcome challenges.

In the context of occult studies, Ariadne's Thread represents the process of navigating through complex ideas, systems, and beliefs to uncover underlying principles and truths. This involves analyzing and retracing the emergence and development of theories and beliefs by examining their foundational concepts. This method is not just a tool to help clarify difficult or obscure ideas but also allows practitioners to delve deeper into the core of an issue or belief. Additionally, Ariadne's Thread can reveal insights into the nature of various esoteric traditions and philosophical frameworks.

The other options provided do not capture the essence of Ariadne's Thread in the context of the occult:

- A randomly generated sequence of points that connects a labyrinth's entrance and exit: This option is more related to the literal meaning of Ariadne's Thread within the mythological story and does not embody the philosophical interpretation associated with occult studies.

- A set of magical symbols employed in talismans and rituals that harness ancient knowledge for personal transformation: Although symbols and rituals do play an important role in the occult, this answer does not represent the metaphorical problem-solving concept of Ariadne's Thread.

- A complex web of interconnected archetypes that reveal the underlying unity within diverse esoteric traditions: While understanding interconnected archetypes can be essential for the exploration of occult realms, this does not embody the specific method of retracing origins that Ariadne's Thread symbolizes.

In conclusion, Ariadne's Thread in the realm of occult studies signifies the philosophical technique of retracing the origins of a theory or belief to its elementary principles. This method allows for the unraveling of complexity, increasing understanding within diverse esoteric traditions and philosophical systems.
