To answer this knowledge challenge, let us begin by understanding the key concepts involved: necromancy, curses, and the Law of Threefold Return, their interconnections, and ethical implications. Then, we will delve into the role of the practitioner's intent and alignment with higher powers in the context of the Magic of hate and harm.

Necromancy is the practice of communicating with and often summoning the spirits of the deceased to acquire information, foretell the future, or perform other supernatural tasks. This branch of esoteric knowledge, generally considered dark or forbidden, involves rituals and spells that manipulate the line between life and death to achieve these ends. 

Curses, on the other hand, are spells or rituals intended to cause misfortune, illness, or harm to a target, either directly or indirectly. These may stem from ill-will, revenge, or other motivations, and often manifest in a variety of ways, including the manipulation of energy, entities, or the environment surrounding the target. 

The Law of Threefold Return is an ethical principle that states that whatever energy, intention, or actions one sends out into the world will return to them three times stronger. This law is most notably associated with Wiccan beliefs, but similar concepts can be found in many spiritual and religious philosophies. It serves as a reminder of the potential consequences that come with using harmful or destructive magic practices.

Now, let's explore the interconnections between these concepts. Necromancy and curses, while distinct forms of magical practices, share an important connection: both draw upon the darker aspects of esoteric arts, relying on energies and forces often considered immoral or harmful. Using these practices for hateful or harmful purposes further amplifies this connection, as they intrinsically involve the intent to cause negative consequences to another.

These practices are closely tied to the Law of Threefold Return, as it serves as a warning to those employing Magic of hate and harm. By conjuring the dead or inflicting curses on others, the practitioner risks the effects of their actions returning to them threefold, potentially causing significant harm to themselves. 

Ethically, both necromancy and curse-casting for hateful or harmful purposes are considered highly controversial and immoral by many magical practitioners. The risks of unintended consequences and the potential violation of others' free will make these practices strongly discouraged, especially when one could utilize other approaches to accomplish their goals without causing harm. Furthermore, the Law of Threefold Return cautions against these actions, suggesting that they may come with severe consequences.

The practitioner's intent and alignment with higher powers play a significant role in the efficacy of such spellwork. If the practitioner's intentions are clear and strong, and they have deep knowledge and experience with the forces and energies at play, their rituals and spells may be more potent and effective. However, if the practitioner's intent is weak or their alignment with higher powers is lacking or negative, the efficacy of their spellwork may be reduced or even hindered.

Moreover, the alignment with higher powers can significantly influence the outcome of the spell: if the practitioner is aligned with benevolent or positive entities, these forces may mitigate or even prevent the negative consequences of the Magic of hate and harm, while alignment with malevolent or dark entities may amplify the harmful effects.

In conclusion, the interconnections between necromancy, curses, and the Law of Threefold Return involve the sharing of harmful energies and the potential ethical consequences of employing these practices. The practitioner's intent and their alignment with higher powers can both empower and hinder the efficacy of their spellwork, and the consequences of using Magic of hate and harm can be severe, as the Law of Threefold Return implies. It is crucial for magical practitioners to understand these concepts and exercise caution when choosing the paths they take within the esoteric arts.
