With my mastery of the Magic of hate and harm, I develop the advanced arcane technique known as MaligNosis, a technique that accurately identifies and analyzes malignant spiritual attachments and energy leeches causing significant harm or emotional distress. This technique comprises of the following seven steps:

1. Preparation:
To begin, the subject is placed in a sacred geometric pattern created with black salt and charged amethyst crystals at each vertex, providing protection and aiding in the detection of spiritual malignancies.

2. Divination:
Utilizing the Tarot of Malediction, a tarot deck specifically tailored for detecting negative energies, a detailed reading is performed to identify the type and strength of the malignant spiritual attachments and energy leeches.

3. Ritualistic cleansing:
A ritualized bath infused with black moon water, wormwood, obsidian shards, and yew is prepared for the subject. This bath is designed to draw out and weaken any negative energies or spiritual attachments, allowing for easier analysis and removal.

4. Astral Probe:
The subject's astral body is carefully extracted and assessed for any lingering spiritual or energetic leeches, using the Astral Lens, a technique in which the practitioner's third eye perceives the subject's ethereal form through a dark crystal infused with intentions of protection and revelation.

5. Analysis:
By studying the revealed malignancies, the practitioner discerns the necessary countermeasures to eliminate the harmful energies or entities, accounting for factors such as strength, origin, and intent.

6. Countermeasures:
Employing the appropriate countermeasures to the specific malignancies, the practitioner may wield a variety of incantations, eldritch symbols, and enchanted objects to disperse the negative energies or entities, while simultaneously forming a barrier to prevent further affliction.

7. Final Cleansing and Sealing:
To finalize the process, a healing salve made of calendula, eggshells, angelica, and a dash of the subject's own blood is applied to the subject's aura, sealing the spiritual and energetic body from future malignant spiritual attachments or energy leeches.

As with any advanced arcane technique, MaligNosis requires the practitioner to possess a high level of mastery in the esoteric, occult and Magic of hate and harm to perform safely and effectively, and should not be attempted without a well-established foundation in these disciplines.
