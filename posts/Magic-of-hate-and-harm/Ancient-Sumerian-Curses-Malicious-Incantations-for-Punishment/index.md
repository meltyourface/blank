Translation and Empowerment of Malignant Cursing Incantations:

1. Incantation of Overwhelming Agony

Original Sumerian Text:
"Utuk-la ilu-ta urru-namtilla, veh-zha namshub-bho ushkak-zha."

Translation:
"From the demon's grasp, I summon unending torment, echoing its malicious words."

This incantation invokes a demon that inflicts unbearable mental and physical pain upon its target. Historically, this curse was used in ancient Sumer to punish enemies of the state and individuals deemed evil by the community.

Required Materials and Gesture:
- A sharp object to draw blood from the caster's finger
- The target's personal belonging (hair, jewelry, etc.)
- A black candle to represent the demon's connection to the underworld

To invoke the curse, the caster must light the black candle and draw a small amount of blood from their finger, using the sharp object. Mixing the blood with the target's personal belonging, they must then recite the incantation in the presence of the burning candle.

Historical Consequence:
The most infamous use of this curse was against the Sumerian official Kishar, who was deemed corrupt by his enemies. Upon being cursed, Kishar was consumed by constant suffering, unable to eat or sleep. Within seven days, he took his own life as a desperate means of escape from the agonizing torment.

2. Incantation to Invoke Malevolent Entities

Original Sumerian Text:
"Gallu-zha irši, lugal-šu muur, eškiriš. Etemmu-zha dallu, bala-kutalla!"

Translation:
"By the dark night, I summon the shadows. Rise, ancient spirits, and crush my enemies!"

This incantation calls upon nefarious supernatural entities from the underworld to bring about chaos, confusion, and destruction to the caster's enemies. 

Required Materials and Gesture:
- A ceremonial knife for ritualistic purpose
- A small clay tablet inscribed with the names of the enemies
- A metal vessel filled with a mixture of snake venom and nightshade

The caster must inscribe the names of their enemies on the clay tablet and place it at the center of a hastily drawn magical circle. They must then pour the venom mixture around the tablet, forming a ring of poison while chanting the incantation. As the incantation is recited, the caster must simultaneously make a series of intricate hand gestures that mimic the actions of summoning dark forces.

Historical Consequence:
A notable use of this curse was during a conflict between the cities of Ur and Lagash. An aggrieved priest from Ur cast the incantation against the leaders of Lagash, causing mass panic and disarray among their people. Consequently, Ur emerged victorious in the ensuing chaos and seized control over Lagash's territory.

3. Incantation of Destructive Energies

Original Sumerian Text:
"Enki-ta, pašiu namtar! Zalag-eš kušum-zha!"

Translation:
"From Enki's wrath, I command the forces of doom! Unleash devastation upon my foes!"

This incantation unleashes chaotic and destructive energies akin to a cataclysmic natural disaster, targeting the caster's enemies with overwhelming force.

Required Materials and Gesture:
- A small vial of sea water, representing Enki's dominion over the watery abyss
- A representation of the desired disaster (e.g., a fiery stone for fire, or a vial of soil for an earthquake)
- A parchment with a symbol of chaos drawn upon it

To cast the incantation, the caster must imbue the sea water with the incantation's destructive intent and sprinkle it onto the chaos symbol on the parchment. They must then hold the desired disaster representation aloft, focused on their intent to unleash destruction, and recite the incantation.

Historical Consequence:
The siege of Nippur serves as a prime example of this curse's application. Nippur's desperate defenders employed the incantation to counter an overwhelming enemy force, causing the heavens to unleash a violent storm that obliterated the invading army.

These malignant cursing incantations not only altered the course of history but also exemplify the malevolent power of the esoteric, occult, and Magic of hate and harm when used with malicious intent.
