The knowledge challenge at hand involves delving deep into the Vintage Horror series Revenge to understand the link between the psychology, motives, alchemical symbolism, and esoteric undertones present within the story. To answer this challenge, we'll first need to analyze and discuss the key concepts and components, establish the connections between them, and evaluate their significance in contributing to the overall esoteric atmosphere that permeates the series.

1. ****Main Character's Psychology****: The central character in the Revenge series, who we'll refer to as the Protagonist, exhibits a complex and multifaceted psychology. The Protagonist is tormented by guilt, obsessive thoughts, and an unsettling sense of uncertainty surrounding their identity. These psychological aspects are significant, as they make the Protagonist more likely to be driven toward seeking knowledge beyond conventional understanding which aligns with the esoteric themes present in the story.

2. ****Motives****: The Protagonist is driven by a desire for retribution for the loss of a loved one and to make sense of the tragedies that have befallen them. This thirst for vengeance, combined with the need for self-discovery, steers them towards the path of the occult and alchemical arts. The esoteric knowledge they uncover grants them the means necessary to exert control over their world and enact revenge on those who have wronged them, reinforcing the series' underlying themes of power and retribution.

3. ****Alchemical Symbolism****: Alchemy, as a mystical science, is deeply intertwined with the concepts of transformation and transmutation. Throughout the Revenge series, alchemical symbolism is apparent in the development of the Protagonist's character. The use of elemental and alchemical motifs, such as the process of nigredo (blackening), albedo (whitening), and rubedo (reddening), symbolizes the internal transformation the Protagonist undergoes. This transformation and growth mirror their journey from darkness and ignorance to enlightenment and mastery of the occult sciences.

4. ****Esoteric Undertones****: The inclusion of alchemical symbolism and the Protagonist's embrace of the occult amplify and maintain the esoteric atmosphere that pervades the Revenge series. The story reveals hidden layers of meaning and knowledge, often accessible only to those with the necessary training or initiation into the esoteric artsâ€”a theme resonant with the Protagonist's own journey. Encounters with supernatural entities and the blurring of boundaries between reality and illusion further accentuate this ambiance and provide the story with an extra layer of depth and nuance.

Now that we have discussed the key concepts related to the psychology, motives, alchemical symbolism, and esoteric undertones present in the Revenge series, we can grasp the interwoven connections that make this series uniquely fascinating.

In essence, the Protagonist's complex psychology and motives propel them into a gripping journey of self-discovery and mastery of the occult arts. Alchemical symbolism serves as the central axis upon which this journey revolves, offering insight into the Protagonist's emotional and psychological development and tying it to their growing mastery of esoteric knowledge. The resulting blend of supernatural elements and arcane wisdom engulfs the entire series in an atmosphere of mystery, mystique, and profound transformation.

In conclusion, the connections between the main character's psychology, motives, and alchemical symbolism in the Vintage Horror series Revenge constitute the backbone of the story's esoteric underpinnings. By engaging with these complex and interconnected themes, the series offers a rich and intellectually stimulating experience that inspires readers to embark on their own journey of self-discovery and awareness.
