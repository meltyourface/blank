To fully understand the ways in which Moina Mathers' career as an artist, her role as a guiding force in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and her creative endeavors in developing the mystic symbolism of the "RR et AC" rituals demonstrate the interconnected mastery of hermeticism, artistic expression, and intimate spiritual exploration, we must first examine the different aspects of her life and career.

Moina Mathers was born Mina Bergson in 1865, in a family that was deeply intellectual and receptive to various fields like art and science. She developed her artistic skills studying at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, thus beginning her career as an artist.

In 1887, Moina became interested in esotericism and the occult after encountering Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, whom she married in 1890. Mathers co-founded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn alongside Dr. William Wynn Westcott and Dr. William Robert Woodman. Moina Mathers later emerged as an influential leader in the Order, serving as an adept, seer, and spiritual guide.

To further answer this knowledge challenge, let us delve deeper into the interconnected mastery of hermeticism, artistic expression, and intimate spiritual exploration that Moina Mathers displayed:

1. Hermeticism: Moina's fascination and significant involvement with the Golden Dawn placed her at the core of Western esotericism. The Golden Dawn was an organization that fused various aspects of occult philosophy, including hermeticism, Kabbalah, alchemy, and Egyptian symbolism. Moina's role in the Order saw her not only understanding and practicing rituals but also shaping the development of these teachings and practices.

2. Artistic Expression: Moina's gift for art manifested significantly in her work in the Golden Dawn. She created numerous paintings and illustrations representing the Order's rituals, concepts, and visualizations. Moina's artwork conveyed the complex symbolism of the hermetic principles, bridging the gap between the abstract mystical teachings and the tangible artistic manifestations. Moreover, by channeling her creativity into the development of the Order's visual elements, her art became crucial in enhancing the spiritual and aesthetic aspect of the organization.

3. Intimate Spiritual Exploration: Throughout her life, Moina developed a profound ability to connect her mystical ideas with her personal spirituality. As the most prominent female adept in the Order, she undertook meditative practices, inner workings, and visionary experiences. Moina's intimate spiritual exploration is evident in her clairvoyant practices and trance mediumship. These practices provided valuable insights that guided the evolution of the Golden Dawn's curriculum and workings.

Moina's contribution to the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis (RR et AC) rituals exemplifies her mastery over these three interconnected aspects. The RR et AC is an advanced level of the Golden Dawn's spiritual teachings, drawing from a variety of mystical sources, including Rosicrucianism and alchemy. Moina's ability to synthesize these complex teachings and symbolisms into her artwork demonstrated her erudition and intuition regarding esotericism. Her creative expression and guidance helped in shaping impactful rituals that deepened the adepts' spiritual experiences.

In conclusion, Moina Mathers' career as an artist, her role as a guiding force in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and her creative endeavors in developing the mystic symbolism of the "RR et AC" rituals showcased the interconnected mastery of hermeticism, artistic expression, and intimate spiritual exploration. Moina's impact on the evolution of modern Western esotericism is beyond tangible, resonating through her artwork, teachings, and influence on the Golden Dawn's practices that continue to inspire spiritual seekers to this day.
