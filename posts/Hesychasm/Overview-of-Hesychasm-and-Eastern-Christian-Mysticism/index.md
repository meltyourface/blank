  Develop a comprehensive annotated bibliography of primary sources on Hesychasm, focusing on the historical development, philosophical underpinnings, and contemplative practices. The bibliography should cover key figures such as St. Gregory Palamas and St. Symeon the New Theologian, as well as notable commentaries on the Hesychast tradition by both Eastern Orthodox and Western scholars. Additionally, include descriptions of the essence-energy distinction, practices of the Jesus Prayer, and the appearance of divine light. For each source, provide a succinct abstract detailing its significance, relevance, and unique contributions to the understanding and practice of Hesychasm.
