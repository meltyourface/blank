## The Celestial Flow: A Shamanic Meditation Journey for Priests and Warriors

Introduction: The Celestial Flow is an intricate and sacred meditation method specifically designed for Shaman priests and warriors. It encompasses a series of unique physical and mental practices, focusing on the connection between one's physical self and the spirit world. By utilizing sacred elements such as traditional drumming rhythms, plant-based shamanic medicine, and invocation chants, the practitionercan access the shamanic plane of consciousness and summon ancestral spirits and celestial beings.

Preparation:

1. ****Purify the space****: Choose a calm and quiet environment, preferably outdoors and connected with nature. Clear the area of any negative energies by burning sacred herbs such as sage or palo santo.
2. ****Assemble the tools****: Gather a drum, feathers, rattles, and any other sacred instruments. Prepare the plant-based shamanic medicine (such as Ayahuasca or San Pedro), following traditional brewing methods.
3. ****Ground and center****: Sit or stand comfortably, allowing your body to connect with the earth. Take slow, deep breaths, focusing on your connection with nature.

Phase 1 - Initiation:

1. ****Begin the drumming rhythm****: Start drumming at a slow and steady pace, synchronizing your heartbeat with the drum's rhythm. This unites your physical being with the spiritual realm.
2. ****Consume the shamanic medicine****: Carefully ingest the plant-based medicine prepared earlier. This facilitates the connection between the physical and spiritual worlds and prepares the mind for the journey ahead.

Phase 2 - Ascension:

1. ****Invoke the elemental spirits****: Call upon the four elements (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water) using personalized, heartfelt invocations. Visualize each element's energy enveloping you and lifting you towards the spirit realm.
2. ****Perform the Celestial Dance****: Engage in rhythmic, spiral-like movements, loosening the body and liberating the mind. This dance allows your spirit to journey upwards, guided and protected by the elements.

Phase 3 - Celestial Interconnection:

1. ****Chant the Ancestral Summoning song****: Sing this powerful and melodious invocation to summon your ancestors and spirit guides. Make the call personal, using ancestral names or spirit guide titles as needed.
2. ****Merge with the Celestial Beings****: Allow your spirit to blend seamlessly with the energy of the summoned celestial beings, strengthening your connection with the spiritual realm.

Phase 4 - Cosmic Wisdom:

1. ****Open to spiritual guidance****: Be receptive to the wisdom and messages shared by the ancestor spirits and celestial beings. Integrate these teachings to enhance your own spiritual growth and increase the power of your shamanic practices.
2. ****Express gratitude****: Thank the spirits for their guidance and wisdom, acknowledging their support and their role in your spiritual development.

Phase 5 - Descent and Reintegration:

1. ****Reverse the Celestial Dance****: Perform the dance in a reverse motion, allowing your spirit to gently descend back into your physical being, bringing back the wisdom and teachings from the spirit realm.
2. ****Ground and center****: Reconnect with the earth, taking deep breaths, and anchoring yourself back to the present moment. Feel the renewed strength and wisdom within you.
3. ****Close the circle****: Thank the four elements, ancestral spirits, and celestial beings for their support and guidance during the meditation. Gently release their energies, letting them return to their realms.

Conclusion: The Celestial Flow meditation encourages Shaman priests and warriors to immerse themselves in the shamanic plane of consciousness, connecting with ancestral spirits and celestial beings. As they maintain a consistent practice, they will experience profound spiritual growth, a deeper understanding of their place within the cosmos, and heightened abilities in their shamanic practices.
