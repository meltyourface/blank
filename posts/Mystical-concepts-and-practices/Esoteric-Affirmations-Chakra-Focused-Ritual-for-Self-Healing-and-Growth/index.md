excerpt: > 
  Develop a comprehensive sequence of esoteric affirmations, incorporating precise mystical concepts and practices, for a progressive opening and harmonization of each chakra, beginning with the Muladhara until culminating in Sahasrara. Ensure that each affirmation correlates to the individual chakra's elemental association, specific vibrational frequency, and psychological or energetic attributes. Additionally, include any relevant mudras, visualizations, or rites to be performed alongside each affirmation to amplify the potency of the process.
