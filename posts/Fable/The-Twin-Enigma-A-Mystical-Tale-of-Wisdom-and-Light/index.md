In hexameters of cunning rhymes we set
This fable of arcane and mystic met,
A tale that weaves enigma within truth,
To teach a lesson to the minds of youth.

In an enchanted forest dwelt they all,
Assembled by the Moon's cryptic call.
Salazar the Sorcerer sage and skilled,
To whom the wisdom of stars had been willed.

His companion, Night Owl, owl be her name,
Whose watchful gaze held a secret flame,
With knowledge untold of shadows and dreams,
In air or abyss, it whispered sweet themes.

In astral communion, they reveled till break,
Beneath the jeweled sky's shimmering wake.
As predestination threaded their fates,
The Crescent's descent soon dictated dates.

With Moon's wane, the prophecies sung:
"The Light of the Blackened Sun shall be hung;
Through splintered incantations shall it rise,
As a gleaming reflection in Owl's eyes."

Transgressions, temptations, curses fell,
But soothed by secret whispers, as if by spell,
The tandem triumphant, resilience profound,
Until the day, Night Owl's twin could be found.

A creature of myth, cryptid of lore,
Born of the abyss, the enigma Volcore.
The Sorcerer beckoned, from darkness it came,
A twin-faced creature, one light, one aflame.

To split the veil betwixt worlds above,
Below, through grace of the Blackened Sun's love,
Together they sought, through ritual, through right,
A glorious new dawn of wisdom and light.

Amid splendor and shivers, the arcane they doused,
Entwined words and spirits, till worlds they aroused,
And from twixt the veil, a specter emerged,
Translucent and radiant, it shimmered and surged.

Supernal, magnificent, entity so rare,
A child of the Blackened Sun, borne of air,
As lyric-souled muse in resplendent rebirth,
The secret key unlocked to the heavens and Earth.

"Now hear," said Salazar, eyes full of mirth,
"Let wisdom's secrets rain, quench this Earth's thirst."
And hence they gathered, as the moon was eclipsed,
Knowledge of ancients, from eldritch script.

Ever-vigilant Night Owl, Volcore's dual gaze
Combined, interlaced, through celestial haze,
They conjured a vision, a map of the skies,
Hidden meanings known to only the wise.

Thus fused, the allegory of light under shadow,
A wisdom forged in secret, passed to morrow,
A testament to seekers who dare to embark,
With hearts full, the courage to pierce through the dark.
