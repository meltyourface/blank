1. **Consecration Ritual**
To imbue the obsidian mirror with the potency of the chosen magic symbols, begin by selecting a sacred space, ideally outdoors under a full moon. Lay a protective circle of salt around the area you've chosen and light four white candles at each cardinal direction (North, East, South, and West). Place the mirror at the center of the circle.

Inscribe the chosen ancient magic symbols onto the surface of the mirror with a consecrated tool like an athame or a ritual dagger charged with intent. After inscribing each symbol, anoint it with a mixture of consecrated oils specifically designed for enhancing magical potency (e.g., frankincense, myrrh, and mugwort).

Once all symbols have been inscribed and anointed, raise your hands above the mirror and recite the following incantation to imbue it with the power of the symbols: "By the ancient powers and wisdom I possess, I consecrate this mirror that it may serve as an instrument of divine insight. May the symbols engraved herein bind and magnify its power for the art of scrying. So mote it be."

2. **Hand Gestures and Incantations**
To create a strong connection between the practitioner and the mirror, perform the following hand gestures and incantations:

A. Begin by placing both hands on the mirror's surface, with fingers spread wide to cover all the inscribed symbols.

B. Close your eyes and take a few deep, centering breaths.

C. **Slowly trace the contours of the magic symbols with your fingertips while reciting the incantation**: "I connect myself with the ancient wisdom and power within, to receive visions and insights from realms unseen."

D. Once all symbols have been traced, press both hands together at the heart center, forming a connection between the physical and astral realms.

3. **Purification Process**
For the purification process, gather the necessary elements like sacred herbs (such as sage, rosemary, and cedar), charged crystals (such as clear quartz, amethyst, or selenite), and resonant sound frequencies (like singing bowls or tuning forks).

Begin by lighting a bundle of the chosen sacred herbs and sensing the area where the scrying session will take place. As you move around the space, visualize a bright, white light cleansing and purifying the area.

Next, place the charged crystals in a circle surrounding the mirror, about a foot away from its edge. This will help create a protective barrier and amplify the energy within the space.

Finally, sound the chosen resonant frequencies using a singing bowl or tuning fork for several minutes. Feel the vibrations clearing any remaining negativity or stagnant energy from the space.

4. **Interpretation Guide**
A step-by-step guide to interpreting the symbols, images, and messages unveiled during the scrying session involves the following:

A. Take note of any prominent symbols, patterns, or images that appear within the mirror during the session. This may include colors, animals, shapes, or scenes.

B. Focus on details and consider if their orientation, size, or movement conveys any meaning.

C. Observe the emotions or sensations accompanying these images, symbols, or messages.

D. Once the session is over, record everything you've seen, heard, or felt in a dedicated magical journal.

E. Spend time in quiet reflection, seeking to understand possible connections between the symbols and your present situation or question at hand.

F. Research unfamiliar symbols, consulting both the esoteric and historical references, to unlock the deeper meanings behind them.

G. Employ dream interpretation techniques and intuition exercises to identify which symbols or messages may have multiple layers or hidden meanings.

H. Finally, synthesize the various interpretations to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what the scrying practice has revealed.
