13-24: To create the remaining 12 symbols, simply invert the patterns of the first 12 symbols along the vertical axis. The astrological associations, alchemical associations, and meanings of these inverted symbols will share core concepts with their counterparts but will express them through opposition or balance.

For example, the 13th symbol, "Ignatius Inversus," will inherit the Mars and Aries associations but may also signify cautious and strategic action rather than aggressive initiation. By using the 24 geomantic symbols outlined above, practitioners can harness their power effectively for diverse divination practices, such as predicting future events, locating lost objects, or determining the outcome of personal decisions.
