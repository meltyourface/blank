To complete the task, we will examine the Solomonic tradition, a school of esotericism that focuses on daemonic entities and is renowned for its elaborate and intricate rituals. **We will then present three case studies of prominent figures within this tradition**: Beelzebub, Astaroth, and Asmodeus. Lastly, we will discuss the moral implications and symbolism associated with their evocations.

1. **Solomonic tradition**:

The Solomonic tradition is an esoteric system that primarily revolves around the evocation, control, and cooperation with daemonic entities to achieve various objectives. Rooted in the medieval grimoires attributed to King Solomon, its practices span over millennia, enveloping various cultural, religious, and magical traditions. The three main aspects of this tradition are the ontological nature of the daemonic entities, the historical development of the tradition itself, and the essential rituals and practices involved.

a) Ontological nature:

Daemonic entities within the Solomonic tradition are viewed as sentient, otherworldly beings with their own desires, motivations, and personalities. These entities possess vast knowledge, power, and abilities far beyond that of humans. Despite their sinister reputation, they can be helpful when properly controlled and appeased through ritual means, thus creating a complex system of mutual benefit between the practitioner and the daemonic entity.

b) Historical development:

The Solomonic tradition's origins can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Israel. The texts attributed to King Solomon, such as the Key of Solomon and the Lesser Key of Solomon (also known as the Lemegeton), have their foundations in these ancient systems of magic. Over time, these practices evolved and amalgamated with European magic, shaping the tradition we know today.

c) Essential rituals and practices:

The Solomonic tradition employs various complex rituals and practices to evoke and control daemonic entities. These include the construction of magical circles, the preparation of magical weapons and tools, the invocation of divine names and words of power, and the use of specific incenses, oils, and symbols. Practitioners are expected to adhere to strict protocols of ritual purity, timing, and secrecy to ensure success in their magical endeavors.

2. **Three case studies**:

a) Beelzebub - Beelzebub, often identified as the 'Lord of the Flies,' is a powerful daemonic entity within the Solomonic tradition. He is known for having dominion over legions of lesser spirits and is linked to death, decay, and the spread of diseases. Through a properly executed evocation, Beelzebub can be commanded to provide hidden knowledge, bestow powerful skills, and manipulate enemies.

b) Astaroth - Astaroth is a duke of Hell within the Solomonic tradition, known for his wisdom, influence, and control over material wealth. Originally derived from the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar and other Near Eastern divinities, Astaroth can be invoked to grant the practitioner divinatory insights, worldly success, and assistance in achieving goals.

c) Asmodeus - Asmodeus is a king of Hell who rules over lust, deceit, and gaming. Linked to the biblical Solomon through the legend of the construction of the First Temple, Asmodeus is a cunning and seductive force within the tradition. When evoked, he can assist the practitioner in attaining influence, unravelling conspiracies, and securing loyalty among allies.

3. **Ethical implications and symbolism**:

The evocation of daemonic entities within the Solomonic tradition raises numerous moral considerations and symbolically represents the practitioner's power over potentially destructive forces. By working with these beings, the practitioner walks a fine line between harnessing their power for personal benefit and succumbing to the temptations they represent. Symbolically, the mastery over daemonic forces signifies overcoming internal and external chaos and achieving balance through the interplay of light and darkness.

In conclusion, the Solomonic tradition is an intricate esoteric system that revolves around the interaction with daemonic entities. Its complex rituals and practices provide a means for practitioners to access the power and knowledge of these beings, while also navigating the ethical considerations and symbolism inherent in these transactions. Beelzebub, Astaroth, and Asmodeus are prominent figures within this tradition, each offering unique insights, opportunities, and challenges to those who dare to invoke them.
