To better understand the intersection between mystical practices in Sufism, Kabbalah, and the Western Esoteric Tradition, we must first have a brief overview of these individual traditions:

1. **Sufism**: Sufism is the mystical branch of Islam, which emphasizes the importance of self-purification, inner work, and spiritual transformation to experience the divine. It seeks to establish a personal and intimate relationship with God through devotional practices such as dhikr (remembrance of God) and asceticism.

2. **Kabbalah**: Kabbalah is Jewish mysticism that aims to gain a deeper understanding of God and the spiritual aspects of life through the study of the hidden meaning behind Hebrew Scriptures. Kabbalistic teaching is mainly focused on understanding the sefirot, which are the ten divine attributes through which God interacts with the creations.

3. **Western Esoteric Tradition**: The Western Esoteric Tradition encompasses a vast array of beliefs and practices, such as astrology, alchemy, and theosophy. It includes philosophical and spiritual systems such as Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and Gnosticism. These systems focus on the exploration of the self and the universe to gain a deeper understanding of the divine and foster spiritual growth.

Shared Themes:

Despite the differences in origin and cultural context, there are several shared themes that emerge in these mystical practices:

1. **Union with the Divine**: All three traditions aim to achieve an intimate relationship or union with the divine, whether it's through seeking God's love and presence in Sufism, through understanding the true nature of God in Kabbalah, or through gaining access to divine wisdom in the Western Esoteric Tradition.

2. **Mystical Experiences**: Each tradition values transcendent, personal experiences that can provide deeper insights into the divine and the self. Sufis may experience ecstatic states through dhikr, while Kabbalists might interpret divine revelations by examining the Scriptures, and the Western Esoteric practitioners might achieve altered states of consciousness through meditation or ritual practices.

3. **Inner Transformation**: All three mystical traditions feature a focus on the individual's transformation and spiritual growth, often through purification, asceticism, and contemplation practices.

Unique Differences:

While there are shared themes amongst the three mystical traditions, there are also unique differences that set them apart:

1. **Cultural Influences**: Each mystical tradition is rooted in its own unique religious and cultural background. Sufism is influenced by Islamic principles, Kabbalah is rooted in Jewish mysticism, and the Western Esoteric Tradition is shaped by various philosophical and spiritual systems in the Western world.

2. **Methodology**: The approach to achieving spiritual insight differs in each tradition. Sufis rely on prayers, devotion, and recitation of God's name, Kabbalists focus on decoding the hidden meanings behind Hebrew texts, while Western Esoteric practitioners employ a wide variety of methods, such as alchemy, astrology, and philosophical reflection.

3. **Symbolism and Language**: Each mystical tradition has its own set of symbols and terminology, representing different aspects of the divine and the spiritual path. For example, Sufis often use the language of love and metaphors of intoxication, while Kabbalists use symbols like the sefirot and the Tree of Life to represent the structure of the divine realm.

In conclusion, the mystical practices found in Sufism, Kabbalah, and the Western Esoteric Tradition intersect through their shared goal of transcending the mundane world to reach deeper spiritual insights. The key themes that emerge from this intersection are the union with the divine, the importance of mystical experiences, and the emphasis on inner transformation. Yet, each tradition carries unique differences in methodology, symbolism, and cultural influences, reflecting the rich diversity and beauty of religious expression worldwide.
