To effectively address the challenge of attaining and sustaining an efficient, balanced, and ethically-driven approach towards the enhancement and mastery of Clairvoyance, it is crucial to examine a wide array of interconnected factors, practices, and philosophical considerations. These aspects are central to nurturing a deep understanding and disciplined practice of clairvoyance while meeting the various nuances presented by historical perspectives, esoteric practices, and cultural understandings. Establishing a foundation of knowledge, followed by disciplined practice and ethical awareness, is critical for clairvoyant development. 

Key Factors:

1. **Understanding of Clairvoyance**: Building a strong foundation by familiarizing oneself with the historical perspectives, cultural contexts, and various manifestations of clairvoyance across time and geographic locations. This serves as a vital starting point for the personal exploration and development of clairvoyant abilities.

2. **Personal Spiritual Development**: A significant factor in the development of clairvoyance is the practitioner's spiritual growth, often facilitated through reflection, meditation, and mindfulness practices. These practices promote self-awareness, self-discovery, and intuitive growth; a balanced spiritual journey contributes to realizing a deepened sense of clairvoyant capacity.

3. **Holistic Wellness**: Achieving a balanced and healthy lifestyle is essential for developing clairvoyance, as our physical, emotional, and mental well-being can directly impact our spiritual receptivity and sensitivity. Cultivating an intentional approach to diet, sleep, exercise, and mental wellness can make a significant difference in one's clairvoyant experiences.

Practices:

1. **Daily Meditation**: Cultivating a daily meditation practice allows the practitioner to tap into their inner awareness while also connecting with external energies. Developing meditation skills encompasses focusing on breathwork, visualization exercises, and techniques from a diverse spectrum of meditation traditions.

2. **Flexing Intuitive Muscles**: Developing clairvoyance requires practitioners to engage their intuition by recognizing and embracing moments of heightened intuition in everyday life, as well as participating in exercises designed to increase intuitive capacities, such as automatic writing, tarot, or dream analysis.

3. **Protection Rituals**: Incorporating protective rituals, like grounding, shielding, or invoking divine assistance, can create a secure energetic environment that allows the practitioner to develop clairvoyance with minimal risk of energetic interference or negativity.

Philosophical considerations:

1. **Ethical Responsibility**: As with any skill or ability, clairvoyance calls for a strong sense of ethical responsibility. Practitioners must establish personal ethical guidelines regarding the use of their abilities, respecting the privacy and free will of others at all times.

2. **Developing Discernment**: The process of refining clairvoyant skills also involves cultivating discernment, deciphering the origin and authenticity of received impressions or visions. Practitioners need to learn how to distinguish between genuine clairvoyant experiences and outcomes influenced by desire, fear, or other sources.

3. **Lifelong Learning**: Finally, mastery of clairvoyance is inextricably linked to a continued commitment to learning, curiosity, and openness to change. Embracing lifelong spiritual growth allows practitioners to continuously develop their clairvoyant abilities, explore new practices, and integrate evolving philosophical considerations.

In conclusion, the enhancement and mastery of clairvoyance require a holistic approach encompassing key factors such as understanding clairvoyance, personal spiritual development, and holistic wellness. Practitioners should engage in daily meditation, flex their intuitive muscles, and adopt protective rituals while maintaining a strong ethical responsibility, developing discernment, and embracing lifelong learning. By maintaining an efficient, balanced, and ethically-driven approach, clairvoyants can navigate their spiritual journey with confidence and integrity.
