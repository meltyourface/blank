The alchemical, astrological, and numerological elements within the work are emblematic of the time, where intricacy ruled the day and served to provide readers with a codex to decipher the enigmatic nature of the work itself.

The alchemical symbolism present in "De ortu medicinae" speaks to the transformative nature of life and the material world, with Van Helmont drawing upon concepts such as the Philosopher's Stone and the four classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Throughout the work, these concepts become integral to Van Helmont's theories on the human body, the ailments it faces, and the cures it may find in the natural world. Attention is drawn to the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm, as well as the concept of connections between all things in the universe, illustrating the holistic viewpoint of Van Helmont's occult medicine and alchemy.

Astrology plays a vital role in elucidating the interconnected nature of the universe, as well as the relationship between celestial bodies and the health of human beings. In "De ortu medicinae," astrological symbols are used to link the planets and celestial events to the nature of individual illnesses and the efficacy of specific treatments.

Numerology provides the work with a framework for understanding the fundamental structure of the universe and the energy that permeates it. Van Helmont introduces numbers as archetypes, each holding specific significance and symbolic meaning. For example, the sacred numbers 3, 4, and 7 make frequent appearances, representing the divine, the four elements, and the union between heaven and earth. This recurring numerological symbolism conveys the significance of harmony and balance within the natural world.

By analyzing the multi-layered symbolism embedded in "De ortu medicinae," we can see how Van Helmont created a rich tapestry of ideas and concepts designed to ignite the imagination and inspire inquiry into the hidden workings of the universe.
