### II. Practices

1. Respect the environment: Always approach the liminal spaces with humility and reverence for both the natural and the human worlds. Leave no trace behind, and honor the sanctity of these thresholds.

2. Protection: Before entering the liminal spaces, ensure you have appropriate psychic and spiritual protection. Ward yourself against unwanted energies and influences that might disrupt your intentions.

3. Know your limitations: Engage with the liminal spaces and their energies based on your level of experience and understanding. Take baby steps and ensure not to overstretch your abilities or dabble in forces you cannot control.

4. Cooperation with others: It is advisable to share your experiences and knowledge with trusted friends or mentors who can provide valuable insights. Establishing a network of like-minded individuals helps in learning from collective wisdom and personal growth.
