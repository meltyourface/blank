As the relentless march of climate change alters the very fabric of the Earth, the margins of wilderness and civilization are in flux, displacing entire ecosystems and awakening ancient forces. This ethereal border, where humanity's reach meets the untamed wilds, speaks of a delicate balance between the familiar and the unknown. Here, traces of magic and lore are entwined, imbuing these liminal spaces with a mystical quality that transcends the mundane. The effects of climate change acutely impact several regions, intensifying humanity's encounters with the creatures and phenomenon that dwell within them.

On the coasts, rising sea levels are becoming more of a threat, prompting coastal communities to adapt in order to survive. As the waters encroach upon the land, the veil between our world and that of the sea-dwelling entities grows ever thinner. These mysterious beings from the depths enter our perception as the tides shift, offering both fresh opportunities for magical exchange and perilous clashes.

In these coastal regions, indigenous magical practices must adapt and evolve in order to protect the people, the land, and the equilibrium. Shamans conjure new rituals, venerable sea-temples and flood defenses rise at the behest of the community, while divination and magic imbued in their ancestral wisdom offer guidance in these times of upheaval. The bond between these cultures and the oceans is strengthened amid new alliances with the aquatic denizens, as they seek mutual respect and understanding.

Simultaneously, the cryosphere – encompassing the Earth's frozen frontiers – is in a state of alarming retreat. As glaciers recede and permafrost melts, once-dormant forces awaken, rousing spirits, and entities from their eons-long slumber. The indigenous people of these regions, skilled in the mystic arts of the icy terrain, find themselves face-to-face with beings long considered mere legends.

These interactions necessitate a re-imagining of traditional myths and practices, as the cold-adapted people collaborate with these previously unfathomable entities to fight against the existential threat of thaw and flooding. The unraveled magical knowledge enriches the region's practices, empowering them to take on the new challenges imposed by a warming world.

In addition to these specific regional examples, the worldwide consequences of climate change forge unforeseen encounters between humankind and the wilderness. These meeting points have long served as repositories of hidden knowledge and concealed histories, their full importance emerging as ecosystems shift, and ancient powers reveal themselves.

It is the role of those who work within the margins of wilderness and civilization to uncover, preserve, reach a deeper understanding, and navigate these transformations. Channeling the ancestral wisdom and mystical practices of various cultures and utilizing unparalleled mastery over the esoteric and occult, these stewards of liminal spaces strive to not only adapt to the challenges brought forth by climate change, but also to engender harmony as the tenuous balance between civilization and wilderness becomes ever more precarious.
