The Rider-Waite Tarot deck, designed by Arthur Edward Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, has been widely regarded for its profound symbolism and connection to various metaphysical systems, such as the Hermetic Qabalah. Within the 78 cards of the deck, the themes of absence and void are notably present, making them fascinating tools to study the Metaphysical Absences that encompass the fabric of existence itself.

The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, representing the archetypes and forces that reflect fundamental aspects of life and its mysteries. This contrasts with the Minor Arcana, which is divided into four suits and represents more everyday experiences. The Major and Minor Arcana interplay to bring balance and wholeness to the tarot readings, giving breadth and depth of insight in various contexts.

A key aspect of the Major Arcana's metaphysical implications of absence is the reversed High Priestess. Upright, the High Priestess signifies intuition, mystery, and the unconscious mind. Reversed, it still embodies elements of intuition but turns into a more passive force, highlighting what isn't there and inviting the individual to seek out hidden knowledge and find balance between conscious and unconscious realms. This connects to the Sephirah Binah in the Tree of Life, representing understanding and receptive formlessness.

The reversed Seven of Cups, from the Minor Arcana, emphasizes the theme of absence through confusion, disillusionment, and wishful thinking. This particular card signifies energies and emotions that are absent from reality and instead dwell within imagination and illusion. Corresponding to the Sephirah Netzach, the reversed Seven of Cups signifies energy and creativity and directs individuals to discern the truth from illusions in their emotional world, reminding them that not everything is as it seems.

Delving into the Qabalah, the negative veils of Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur embody the essence of Metaphysical Absences. Ain represents the void from which all creation emerges, while Ain Soph symbolizes the limitless and infinite divine energy. Ain Soph Aur, the "limitless light," encompasses the bridge between nothing and something, ultimate potential and manifestation.

For the Rider-Waite Tarot deck and the Hermetic Qabalah, the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life emanates from these veils, meaning that each card corresponds to a specific Sephirah and thereby indicating an absence in the aspect of existence. For instance, the Fool corresponds to Kether (the Crown), the first Sephirah, and its link to Ain Soph Aur supplies it with an innate origin related to the void.

Exploring Metaphysical Absences within the Rider-Waite Tarot deck through this symbolism and connection to the Hermetic Qabalah allows for a comprehensive understanding of how these themes can guide interpretation during divination. By examining aspects of absence in the individual cards, it becomes possible to discern and contemplate not only what is material and present but also that which remains hidden, as-yet unmanifested or absent from one's understandings and perceptions. This attunement to the presence of absence aids in enriching the practices of tarot and Qabalah, offering insight and depth to existential inquiries and self-discovery.
