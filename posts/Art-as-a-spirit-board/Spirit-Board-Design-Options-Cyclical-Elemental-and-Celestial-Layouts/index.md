Layout 1: Archetypal Journey

In this first design, the spirit board will follow a circular layout representing the cyclical nature of the Major Arcana's Fool's Journey. The 22 cards will be positioned around the edge in their numbered order, with their respective symbols and images interwoven into the border. The center will showcase a stylized rendition of The World card, reinforcing the idea of completion and wholeness. The planchette in this design will have a classic triangular shape, but adorned with the symbols of the four elements (Fire, Water, Air, and Earth) to represent balance. A muted, yet rich color palette of earthy tones will bring a subtly mystical atmosphere to the design.

Layout 2: Elements and Mysticism

This second design incorporates a square layout, dividing the board into four quadrants dedicated to the four elements, with the elemental cards being the main focus (The Emperor for Fire, The Empress for Earth, The Chariot for Water, and The Lovers for Air). The other Major Arcana cards will be artistically scattered within the borders of their corresponding elements. The board's corners will showcase the symbols of the four elements in a more ornate style. The planchette for this design will take an asymmetrical shape, with decorative filigree and an all-seeing eye in the center. The color scheme will feature bold, complementary colors to represent the interplay of the elements.

Layout 3: Celestial Harmony

In this final design, the spirit board's form will resemble a star or mandala pattern. The 22 cards will be organized along radial lines drawn from the center to the edges of the board, giving a sense of unity and continuity. Astrological symbols will intertwine with the Major Arcana card images to further emphasize the connection between the Tarot and the cosmos. In this variation, the planchette will feature a crescent moon shape, adorned with zodiac sign symbols and a pentacle at the heart of the crescent. The color scheme will consist of deep blues and purples, with metallic gold accents for a celestial touch.

These three diverse designs showcase the Art as a spirit board's expertise in creating intricate and visually captivating layouts, all while maintaining the functionality required for spirit communication.
