1. Selection of plants and their symbolism in the context of the spirit board:

a. Sage (Salvia officinalis) - Sage is a popular herb used for spiritual cleansing and protection. In the context of the spirit board, sage can aid in keeping the space safe from unwanted negative energies.

b. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) - This fragrant plant carries a calming and soothing energy, which can help create a peaceful atmosphere during a séance. Lavender also encourages clear communication and can aid in connecting with higher realms.

c. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - Mugwort has long been used for its psychic-enhancing properties. Incorporating it into the spirit board can heighten intuition and help users access the subconscious mind during consultations.

d. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) - Rosemary is believed to promote memory and clarity of thought. Integrating this herb in the spirit board can help maintain focus and concentration during a reading.

e. Sweetgrass (Hierochloe odorata) - Known for attracting positive energy and inviting in benevolent spirits, sweetgrass can create a harmonious environment for spirit board sessions.

2. Process of preparing and preserving herbs and leaves:

First, the selected plants should be thoroughly cleaned and allowed to dry naturally. To preserve their vibrant colors, place the herbs and leaves between the pages of a heavy book or a flower press for about two weeks. This will leave them flat, dry, and ready to be embedded within the spirit board design.

3. Artistic approach to arranging botanical components:

The botanical elements should be thoughtfully integrated into the spirit board's overall theme and design. For example, the sage could be placed in each corner of the board to symbolize protection and keep negative energies at bay. Lavender can form a circle around the alphabet, representing the calming and soothing energy it brings to the communication process. Mugwort can be arranged in a crescent moon shape near the letters and numbers, reflecting its association with intuition and psychic abilities. Rosemary can be interwoven within the board's imagery to promote clarity and focus during the séance. Sweetgrass can create a radiant pattern emanating from the center of the board, symbolizing its ability to attract positive energy and benevolent spirits.

4. Guidelines for using the enhanced spirit board:

a. Take time to cleanse and consecrate the board before each use, as botanical elements may absorb and store energies over time.
b. Acknowledge and invite the energies and properties of the integrated plants into the session.
c. Allow the calming and protective elements of the herbs to establish a comfortable and safe environment for channeling spirits.
d. Keep in mind the influence of intuition-enhancing plants (such as mugwort), which may enable a deeper and more profound connection to the spirit realm.
e. Be aware that the botanical elements may affect the overall energy of the séance and provide additional insight into the messages received.
