To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the individual components involved, namely, the architecture, ley lines, and shadow entities, and then delve into their interconnected relationships and how they jointly affect the energies in a house swarming with powers of darkness. Lastly, we shall discuss rituals and occult symbolism that can be employed for harnessing or transmuting these energies for personal transformation.

1. Architecture, Ley Lines, and Shadow Entities:

a. **Architecture**: In a house swarming with powers of darkness, the architecture is designed in such a way that it facilitates the flow of dark energies. The layouts of rooms, corridors, and even the positioning of artifacts contribute to the overall energy in space. For instance, Gothic architecture often incorporates gloomy features such as gargoyles, pointed arches, and vaulted ceilings to amplify the atmosphere's overall dark energy.

b. **Ley Lines**: These are invisible lines of energy that connect various sacred sites and places with significant spiritual and historical relevance. In a house swarming with powers of darkness, these ley lines carry dark energies, connecting the house to other places of dark power or significance.

c. **Shadow Entities**: Shadow entities refer to supernatural or paranormal beings that exist in the realm of darkness, often manifesting in the form of shadows or dark figures. These entities are attracted to places where dark energies are concentrated and can either be malicious or neutral, depending on circumstances and intentions at play.

2. **Interconnected Relationship and Energies**:

The architecture, ley lines, and shadow entities are intrinsically linked in a house swarming with powers of darkness. The house's architecture can both harness and amplify the dark energies flowing along the ley lines. It may do so through the careful arrangement of rooms and hallways in relation to the lines, or through the use of sigils, magical symbols, and other occult tools embedded within the design.

The amplified dark energies attract shadow entities, which not only heighten the dark powers within the house but also influence the energies and experience for the occupants. The house becomes a nexus of dark energy, making it a powerful location for those who wish to harness its power or an ominous place for the uninitiated who may inadvertently invoke the shadow entities.

3. Rituals, Occult Symbolism, and Personal Transformation:

To harness or transmute the energies within a house swarming with powers of darkness, one must employ rituals, occult symbols, and other means that resonate with these energies. This includes using specific symbols, sigils, or patterns that connect to the dark energies or entities present in the house. 

A few examples of such rituals and techniques include:

a. **Drawing a protective circle**: This can keep the practitioner safe from the darker energies while they work to harness or transmute them.

b. **Sigil magic**: Utilizing sigils or symbols charged with intent creates a connection to these energies, allowing the practitioner to manipulate or direct them for transformation.

c. **Ritual spellwork**: Invoking specific entities or forces that resonate with the darker energies to assist in transmutation or the harnessing of this power.

d. **Shadow work**: Confronting one's own inner darkness and utilizing it as a source of strength, growth, and transformation.

In summary, a house swarming with powers of darkness is a nexus where architecture, ley lines, and shadow entities connect and influence the emanating energies. The architecture harnesses and amplifies these energies, while the ley lines serve as conduits, and the shadow entities interact with the space, adding to the house's dark power. To harness or transmute these energies for personal transformation, one must employ effective rituals and occult symbolism that resonate with the dark energies and entities within the space. By doing so, a practitioner can tap into these potent forces to face their own darkness, overcome fears, and ultimately, unleash their untapped potential.
