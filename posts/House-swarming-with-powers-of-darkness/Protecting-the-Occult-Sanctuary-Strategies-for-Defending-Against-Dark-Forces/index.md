1. **Identifying and Neutralizing Access Points**: Begin by conducting a thorough examination of the House, using spiritual divination techniques such as energy readings, dowsing, and clairvoyance to identify hidden artifacts, portals, and cursed chambers. Employ rituals of banishment and destruction to neutralize each discovered access point. Seal off portals and dispose of cursed artifacts according to ancient occult practices.

2. **Establishing an Aura of Protection**: Collaborate with experienced practitioners of the esoteric arts in forging powerful protective wards, shields, and sigils that repel malevolent forces. Place these at key entry points and throughout the House, strengthening the borders of the House against infiltration by dark energies.

3. **Designing the Interior Layout**: Enlist the help of architects and geomancers to design and construct a complex, maze-like layout that incorporates esoteric symbolism, sacred geometry, and natural elements to disorient and deter malevolent entities from navigating the House. This labyrinthine design will create a protective barrier within the House.

4. **Spiritual Cleansing and Purification**: Invest in an extensive collection of holy water, blessed incense, and enchanted talismans, and perform regular cleansing rituals that maintain the sanctity of the House. Adapt these rituals according to the specific dark forces seeking entry and respond with the appropriate countermeasures.

5. **Researching House History**: Delve into the House's past by reviewing archives, interviewing former occupants, and consulting experts on local legends. Collect detailed accounts of any occult connections and their possible ramifications, enabling the House's defenders to better predict and counteract any opening for dark energies.

6. **Assembling the Library**: Devote time and resources to amassing a comprehensive collection of texts on occult knowledge, dark entities, and magical banishment techniques. Regularly update and curate this library, ensuring that its contents remain relevant and accessible to the House's defenders.

7. **Developing Occult Alliances**: Forge connections within the wider occult community, sharing information and resources to help each other identify and counteract emerging threats. Attend conferences, workshops, and forums to stay informed on the latest developments within the world of dark forces.

8. **Assessing Geomantic Energies**: Study the local ley lines, geomantic energies, and astral disturbances that may act as catalysts for dark forces. Regularly analyze data gathered from these sources, taking immediate action to address any potential threats or weaknesses in the House's defenses.

9. **Reviewing and Adjusting Strategies**: Continuously reassess the House's defensive measures, incorporating new knowledge, tools, and techniques into the existing defenses as necessary. Stay adaptable and ever-vigilant to ensure the enduring safety of the House.

10. **Training Future Defenders**: Share the accumulated wisdom and experience with a new generation of occult specialists, providing them with the necessary skills, resources, and guidance to maintain the House's defenses against dark forces. Through mentorship and training, ensure the ongoing legacy of protection at the House swarming with powers of darkness.
