## Enchantment of Prosperity and Abundance

**Magical Intention or Objective**: To manifest a continuous flow of financial prosperity and abundance into one's life.

### I. Preparatory Stage
- Cleanse and consecrate the ritual space.
- Cast a circle to create a sacred space for the working.
- Invite the appropriate elemental spirits and/or guardians according to the Gardnerian tradition.

### II. Optimal Moon Phase
- Waxing (Crescent to Gibbous) or Full Moon for attracting positive energy and manifesting abundance.

### III. Elemental Associations
- Earth: Stability, foundation, and manifestation of material wealth.
- Water: Fluidity, adaptability, and flow of prosperity.
- Fire: Drive, motivation, and passion for acquiring wealth.
- Air: Intellect, communication, and clarity of financial goals.

### IV. Traditional Deities, Symbols, and Sacred Tools
- Deities: Fortuna (Roman goddess of fortune), Lakshmi (Hindu goddess of wealth), or Hermes (Greek god of commerce).
- Symbols: Pentacle or coin (representing wealth and money), Horn of Plenty (representing abundance), and Sigil of Prosperity.
- Sacred Tools: Green or gold candles (to symbolize wealth and success), besom (to sweep away blockages), chalice (for offerings), athame (to direct energy), and cauldron (for burning herbs or crafting potions).

### V. Ritual Steps and Sequence

1. **Invoke the chosen deity for assistance by chanting the following invocation**:

"Fortuna/Lakshmi/Hermes, gods/goddess of prosperity and wealth,
I call upon your divine grace to join me in this sacred space,
Bless my endeavors and guide my path,
Infuse this ritual with your abundant energy and ever-lasting power."

2. Light the green or gold candles while focusing your intention on financial abundance.

3. Place a pentacle or coin, and any other symbols of prosperity, on the altar or in the center of the circle.

4. Using the besom, sweep the ritual space in a clockwise direction to symbolize the removal of financial obstacles and the welcoming of abundance.

5. Blend a mixture of appropriate herbs, such as basil, cinnamon, and bay leaves, to symbolize wealth and success. Burn the herbs in the cauldron. Alternatively, use the herbs to create an oil or potion.

6. **Hold the athame above the burning herbs and visualize your financial objectives while chanting the following incantation**:

"By earth, air, fire, and water,
I call upon the elements to assist my conjure,
Prosperity and abundance I now demand,
Bring forth wealth with your loving hand."

7. Make offerings to the deity in the chalice (e.g., milk, honey, or wine) while expressing gratitude for their assistance.

8. Meditate on the flow of prosperity entering your life, visualize this energy as a golden light surrounding you.

9. When ready, close the circle by thanking and releasing the elemental spirits and/or guardians.

10. Allow the candles to burn down completely or snuff them out, symbolizing successful completion of the ritual.

### VI. Post-Ritual Actions
- Carry the charged pentacle, coin, or crafted potion with you as a talisman for attracting prosperity.
- Practice gratitude and maintain focus on your financial goals.
- Periodically renew the enchantment through meditation or repetition of the ritual as desired.
