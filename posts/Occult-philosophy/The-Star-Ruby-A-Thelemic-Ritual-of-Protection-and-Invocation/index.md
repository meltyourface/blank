Ritual: The Star Ruby (ΜΕΓΑΣ ΑΣΤΗΡ ΡΟΥΦΗΧ)

Historical Background:
The Star Ruby is a Thelemic ritual that was introduced by Aleister Crowley as a replacement for the traditional Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) used in the Golden Dawn system of magic. It is a powerful ritual of protection, invocation, and banishing, utilizing Thelemic elements and symbolism. It is featured in The Book of Lies and The Equinox, key texts within the Thelemic tradition.

Contemporary Adaptation:

### I. The Prologue
Stand facing East, in the center of your designated space. Take a moment to breathe deeply and center yourself. Visualize an infinite stream of energy descending upon you from the cosmos.

### II. The Qabalistic Cross
Touch the forehead, and say, in a clear and confident voice: ATEH (Unto Thee)
Touch the chest, and say: MALKUTH (The Kingdom)
Touch the right shoulder, and say: VE-GEBURAH (And the Power)
Touch the left shoulder, and say: VE-GEDULAH (And the Glory)
Clasp the hands upon the chest, and say: LE-OLAM (Forever)
Finish the cross by saying: AMEN.

### III. The Invocation of the Elements
Face East, and visualize an electric blue pentagram within a yellow hexagram. ****Extend your right hand, make a banishing Earth pentagram, and recite****: ΘΕΡΙΟΝ (Therion)

Turn to the North, visualize the electric blue pentagram within a black hexagram. ****Make a banishing Earth pentagram, and recite****: ΝΥΙΘ (Nuit)

Face West, visualize the electric blue pentagram within a green hexagram. ****Make a banishing Earth pentagram, and recite****: ΒΑΒΑΛΟΝ (Babalon)

Turn to the South, visualize the electric blue pentagram within a crimson hexagram. ****Make a banishing Earth pentagram, and recite****: ΕΡΩΣ (Eros)

Return to the East and complete the circle, extending your right arm in a slicing motion along the path you just walked. As you do so, visualize an electric blue circle surrounding the circle.

### IV. The Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel
Retire to the center of the circle and stand with your body erect and your arms outstretched in the form of a cross.
Say: ΠΡΟ ΜΟΥ (Before me) ΡΑΦΑΗΛ (Raphael)
Say: ΟΠΙΣΘΟ ΜΟΥ (Behind me) ΓΑΒΡΙΗΛ (Gabriel)
Say: ΔΕΞΙΑ ΜΟΥ (On my right) ΜΙΧΑΗΛ (Michael)
Say: ΕΥΩΝΥΜΟ ΜΟΥ (On my left) ΟΥΡΙΗΛ (Uriel)

Visualize the Archangels around you, Raphael in the East, Gabriel in the West, Michael on the right, and Uriel on the left. Sense their overwhelming presence and the energy emitted by them.

### V. The Closing
Stretch your arms over your head, clasp your hands, and say: ΑΓΙΟΣ, ΑΓΙΟΣ, ΑΓΙΟΣ ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ΣΑΒΑΟΘ (Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of the Universe)
Chant the word "ΙΑΩ". 

Commentary:

The Star Ruby retains the core structure and purpose of the Golden Dawn’s LBRP, while incorporating key Thelemic elements such as the Archangels, the hexagrams, and the use of Greek words. These adaptations reinforce the Thelemic cosmology, particularly, the interplay between Nuit (the infinite space) and Hadit (the point of experience).

The use of modern language, technology, and updated cultural references makes the ritual accessible and relevant for contemporary practitioners. For example, virtual reality or augmented reality could be employed to help with the visualization and sense of immersion.

The Star Ruby continues to hold significance for Occult practitioners today because it encompasses the evolving spirit of Thelema and serves as a bridge between the rich history of the Golden Dawn and the unique Thelemic tradition. It is essential for Thelemites and other seekers of the Occult to learn, adapt, and evolve this ritual for the current generation, ensuring that the wisdom and knowledge within it are not lost to time.
