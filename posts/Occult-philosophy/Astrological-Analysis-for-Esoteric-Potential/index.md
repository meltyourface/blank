To complete this task, I would require specific birth details of an individual such as date, time, and place of birth. However, since you did not provide those details, I will explain the general method and principles of analyzing an astrological birth chart with a focus on occult philosophy, which can be applied to any specific chart.

1. ****Planetary positions****: Examine the position of each planet in the signs and houses, and the aspects they create. As each planet represents a different aspect of the individual's personality, these positions will reveal their occult potential.

For example:
- Sun: The individual's core essence and life purpose. In an occult context, this may relate to the individual's spiritual mission or the role they have chosen to fulfill in this life.
- Moon: The individual's emotional nature and subconscious desires. It symbolizes the individual's psychic abilities and intuition and indicates how they can channel their emotional energies in esoteric practices.
- Mercury: Communication and mental abilities. Mercury's position may suggest the individual's propensity for learning and understanding esoteric knowledge, and occult practices such as tarot, numerology, or astrology.

2. ****House positions****: Each house represents a different area of life, and the planets in those houses show how the individual can manifest their occult potential in that area. For example, a strong presence in the 8th house (house of transformation and the occult) might suggest the person is naturally drawn to exploring hidden, mysterious subjects and has a natural talent for transformational work.

3. ****Aspects****: Examine the aspects between the planets, as these show the connections and relationships between different aspects of the individual's esoteric potential. For example, a trine between the Sun and Neptune might give the individual a deep spiritual insight and strong intuition.

4. ****Symbols, sigils, and talismans****: Investigate any symbols or sigils present in the chart that correspond to esoteric practices, as these represent specific energies that can be harnessed by the individual. For example, the Star of David (a hexagram) or Sacred Geometry might appear as a powerful guiding symbol in the chart.

5. ****Major and minor arcana****: Consider the major arcana tarot cards that correspond to the individual's Sun, Moon, and Rising signs. The qualities and energies of these cards can reveal additional layers of meaning within the individual's occult personality. Additionally, analyze any significant minor arcana cards that appear in connection with the individual's major life events or themes, as these can offer further context and nuance to the interpretation.

By applying this method, one can provide a comprehensive occult character analysis that delves into the nuances of the individual's esoteric potential and reveals the forces shaping their spiritual journey.
