1. **Materials selection**:
For Water, choose Aquamarine, a natural gemstone that resonates with the water element, symbolizing fluidity and emotional healing. For Earth, select Obsidian, representing grounding, stability, and protection. For Wind, opt for Citrine, embodying the air element and associated with mental clarity, communication, and inspiration. Finally, pick Garnet for Fire, symbolizing passion, courage, and transformation.

2. **Design conception**:
Create a circular blueprint with four quadrants, each representing one of the four elements. In the Water quadrant, incorporate a wavy line to symbolize fluidity and flowing movement. In the Earth quadrant, include a square or hexagon, symbolizing stability and grounding. In the Wind quadrant, design a spiral or feather, representing free-flowing air and inspiration. In the Fire quadrant, integrate a triangle or a flame, symbolizing passion and transformation. Ensure that these symbols are integrated harmoniously and balanced within the circle to encourage the effective flow of energies.

3. **Crafting techniques**:
Begin by carving and shaping the chosen gemstones into their respective elemental symbols. Then, create a small metal frame made of either silver or copper to house the gemstones. Use soldering techniques to assemble and connect the frame, ensuring a secure structure. Next, carefully set each gemstone into its designated place within the frame, using prongs or bezels to hold them firmly in place. Polish the metal frame to achieve a bright, even finish.

4. **Elemental charging**:
For Water: Immerse the talisman in a flowing river or ocean waves. Perform a meditation focusing on the element of water, channeling its energies into the talisman for a minimum of 20 minutes.
For Earth: Bury the talisman in rich soil beneath the roots of a strong, healthy tree. Leave it there for a full day and night cycle, allowing its energy to absorb the grounding vibrations and natural energies of the Earth.
For Wind: On a windy day, climb to a high elevation, holding the talisman aloft. Allow the wind to pass through and around it for at least half an hour, focusing on the intention of imbuing the talisman with the element of air.
For Fire: During a fire ceremony or a bonfire, place the talisman on a fireproof dish and pass it through the flames, visualizing the fire's transformative energy charging the talisman. Do this for 5-10 minutes until you feel the talisman is adequately charged.

5. **Balance and harmonization**:
Perform a culminating ceremony during a day of balanced elemental energies, such as on an equinox or solstice. Gather elemental representations, such as a bowl of water, a dish of soil, incense, and a candle. Cast a circle and call upon guardians or deities associated with each element for guidance, support, and protection. Meditate on the harmonizing of these elemental energies within the talisman, ensuring each force is working together for the greater good.

6. **Activation and maintenance**:
To activate the elemental properties of the talisman, hold it in your dominant hand and speak an incantation that resonates with your intention for the amulet, such as "I call upon the powers of Water, Earth, Wind, and Fire to infuse and activate this talisman, granting me balance, protection, and mastery over the elements." 

To maintain the amulet's potency, regularly cleanse it of any unwanted energies through smudging, placing it in natural running water, or allowing it to charge in the moonlight. Perform a maintenance ritual periodically (monthly, seasonally, or yearly), repeating the activation and charging steps to ensure the talisman's continued effectiveness.
