To create a comprehensive funeral floral arrangement plan for the deceased avid gardener, we must begin by understanding their unique gardening preferences, cherished plant species, and preferred color schemes. We will use their passion for horticulture and the cycles of nature as our underlying theme while incorporating distinctive floral design techniques and sustainable, locally sourced plants.

[Deceased Gardener's Name] Floral Tribute Plan:

1. **Preliminary Research**:
- Speak with the deceased's family and closest friends to gather information about their favorite plants, colors, and gardening preferences.
- Visit the deceased's garden and take note of any recurring elements, distinctive features, and species that hold personal significance.
- Explore the possibility of using plants from the deceased's garden within the floral arrangements.

2. **Preferred Plant Species**:
- Roses: Symbolizing love and appreciation
- Lilies: Representing the restoration of innocence after death
- Sunflowers: Embodying warmth and happiness
- Ferns: Symbolizing eternal life and rejuvenation
- Lavender: Used for serenity and tranquility
- Baby's breath: Signifying everlasting love and purity

3. **Color Scheme**:
- Soft pastels (pinks, lavender, and blues) to create a calming atmosphere
- Vibrant greens to represent growth and renewal
- Earthy tones (browns, tans, and creams) as an homage to the gardener's close connection to the soil

4. **Underlying Theme**:
- The cycles of nature, representing the ebb and flow of life itself, emphasizing the parallels between gardening, growth, and rebirth.

5. **Floral Design Techniques and Components**:
- A heart-shaped wreath made with greenery, roses, and lilies as the focal point and centerpiece. This signifies the deceased's love for gardening.
- Garlands crafted from vines, ferns, and sunflowers to drape across the casket, evoking emotions of warmth and continuity.
- Locally sourced moss and sustainably harvested wood to create a natural foundation for the arrangements, showcasing the gardener's commitment to environmentalism.
- Organic shapes, mimicking the fluidity and unstructured beauty found in nature, will be used throughout the arrangement designs.
- A rustic floral cross arrangement made of fragrant lavender and baby's breath, representing the deceased's spiritual connection to their passion for gardening.

6. **Sustainable and Locally Sourced Plants**:
- Consult with local nurseries and community gardens to source plants as close to the service location as possible.
- Include potted plants, which can later be donated, repurposed, or planted in honor of the deceased, underlining the cyclic nature of life.
- Use biodegradable ribbons, twine, and other natural materials when possible, avoiding the use of non-renewable resources.

By following this comprehensive funeral floral arrangement plan, we will create a profound visual tribute that honors the deceased avid gardener's passion for horticulture, resonating with the attendees and providing them with a meaningful representation of the deceased's connection to the cycles of nature.
