## Embracing the Divine Feminine: A Guided Meditation with Goddess Isis

**Background Music**: Soft instrumental harp music playing softly in the background.

Introduction:
Welcome to this guided meditation experience, focused on invoking and honoring the divine feminine energy within each one of us. Today, we will connect with the Egyptian goddess Isis, a powerful symbol of feminine strength, love, and healing. As we go through this meditation, we will be guided through visualization, breathing techniques, and powerful mantras to embrace the divine feminine essence fully.

Let us begin by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes gently and take a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each exhale, let go of any tension or stress that resides within your body.

As we continue with our deep breaths, start to visualize a beautiful, golden sun setting on the horizon. The sky is filled with a warm, radiant glow. Feel this warm, nurturing light softly touching your skin, embracing you with its divine energy.

Invoking Goddess Isis:

Now, imagine a figure gracefully walking towards you, emerging from the golden sunlight. As she gets closer, you observe that she is a stunning woman with long, dark hair and enchanting eyes. She is adorned in gold jewelry and wearing a graceful, flowing gown. Upon her head is a magnificent crown, bearing the symbol of a throne and wings.

This beautiful, powerful woman is Goddess Isis. As she gets closer, you can sense her nurturing, loving, and protective energy. She smiles at you, and you feel a deep, warm connection with her.

**Breathing Technique**: Fourfold Breath

Now, Goddess Isis gently encourages you to practice a breathing technique, known as the Fourfold Breath. Inhale for a count of four, then hold the breath for a count of four. Exhale for a count of four, and finally, hold the breath for another count of four. As you breathe, visualize a golden light entering your body, filling you with warmth, love, and the healing energy of the divine feminine.

**Mantra**: "I embrace the power of the divine feminine within me."

As you continue to breathe, repeat the following mantra silently or out loud:

"I embrace the power of the divine feminine within me."

Feel the energy of this mantra resonating within your entire being as it strengthens your connection to Goddess Isis and the divine feminine.

Empowerment:

Now, Goddess Isis gently places her hand on your heart, and a paragon of warmth and light engulfs your entire being. Feel the sensation of warmth, love, and empowerment radiating through your body. Let this energy balance and harmonize your feminine and masculine qualities, creating a perfect equilibrium within you.

Imagine this powerful energy extending outwards, connecting you to the divine feminine energies and wisdom of all those who have ever lived. Feel this collective power, love, and support merging with your own, amplifying your connection to the divine feminine.

Closing:

Slowly, Goddess Isis steps back and begins to walk away, returning to the golden sunlight. As the light softly fades, take a few deep breaths and start to bring your awareness back to your physical surroundings.

When you are ready, gently open your eyes, carrying with you the powerful energy of the divine feminine and your profound connection with Goddess Isis. Throughout your day, remember that you, too, embody the essence of the divine feminine, filled with love, strength, wisdom, and healing.
