## The Ceremony of the Scorpio Vermilion

**Objective**: To pay homage and propitiate the spirit of a powerful sorcerer from an ancient bloodline of necromancers, the Scorpio Vermilion.

### Part 1: Preparation
1. Choose a secluded location with a rich connection to the Earth, such as a cave, an ancient burial site, or ancestral grounds of the Scorpio Vermilion bloodline.
2. Select a specific date and time for the ceremony that aligns with the new moon, a powerful time to connect with the spirit world.
3. Gather your ritual tools, which should include, but are not limited to: a ritual dagger, a chalice filled with red wine, a black-handled censer filled with incense, a black altar cloth embroidered with the emblematic symbols of the Scorpio Vermilion bloodline (e.g., a red scorpion encircled with a serpent), seven black candles, salt, and a parchment with the invocation inscribed.
4. Choose offerings that hold significance to the ancestor, such as dried herbs, their favorite food, and objects of personal value.

### Part 2: The Altar
1. Arrange the altar with precision, placing the ritual dagger to the east, the chalice to the west, the censer to the north, and the black candles to the south.
2. Beneath the altar cloth, scatter the salt in the shape of a septagram (a seven-pointed star), symbolizing the seven pinnacles of the necromantic arts.
3. Place the offerings beside or on the altar as appropriate.

### Part 3: Elements and Invocation
1. Use the ritual dagger to draw a circle around the participants, sealing the space and protecting them from unwanted energies.
2. Light each of the seven black candles while reciting the names of the seven pinnacles of the necromantic arts: Evocation, Divination, Transmutation, Animation, Manipulation, Consecration, and Illumination.
3. Hold the parchment with the invocation inscribed and start chanting the names of the ancestor and their significant deeds, connecting to their energy and opening the gateway between the worlds.
4. Recite aloud the invocation:

    "Oh, mighty spirit of the Scorpio Vermilion,
    Ancient bloodline of sorcery and necromancy,
    We call upon you on this sacred night,
    To honor your legacy, your power, and your might.

    Ancestor of shadows, whisperer in the dark,
    Reveal thy mysteries, and leave thy mark.
    Accept our offerings, our love, and our devotion,
    And grant us the wisdom of your endless emotion.

    We invoke thee, [Ancestor's Name], bearer of the Vermilion name,
    Rise from the depths, and join our sacred flame.
    Guide us and teach us, as we walk thy path,
    To master thy art and to know thy craft."

### Part 4: The Personalized Aspect and Offerings
1. Select an object or symbol that represents the ancestor's most significant accomplishment, such as a talisman, artifact, or a family heirloom.
2. Display the object on the altar and recount the tale of the ancestor's accomplishment, giving thanks for their wisdom and influence.
3. Raise the chalice, offer a toast to the spirit, and pour a libation of the red wine onto the ground.
4. Place the offerings on or beside the altar, expressing gratitude for the ancestor's presence and the insights they provide.

### Part 5: Closing the Ceremony
1. After a moment of silence and reflection, thank the ancestor for their guidance and the wisdom that was shared.
2. Extinguish the black candles one by one, releasing the power of each pinnacle back into the ether.
3. While holding the ritual dagger, close the circle, expressing gratitude to the protective energies that surrounded the ceremony.
4. Dispose of the offerings according to chosen tradition, ensuring to respect the ancestral spirit.

The Ceremony of the Scorpio Vermilion allows for a deep connection to the ancient bloodline's spirit and the honored ancestor, providing participants with a transformative and meaningful experience aligned with the principles of necromancy and propitiation of the dead.
