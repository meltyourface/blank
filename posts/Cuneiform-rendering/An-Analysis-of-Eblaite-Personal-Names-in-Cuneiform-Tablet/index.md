As a master of esoteric studies, I shall provide a detailed analysis of the Eblaite personal names found in a late third millennium BCE Cuneiform tablet. It should be noted that Eblaite, a now-extinct Semitic language, was spoken in Ebla (located in modern-day Syria) during this period. The tablet in question contains personal names of individuals from the Eblaite civilization, written in Cuneiform script.

The Eblaite language uses a combination of logograms (ideographic signs) and phonetic components (syllabic signs). When analyzing personal names, one can identify common logograms used across multiple names, such as symbols representing gods or occupations. Deciphering the intricacies of these names may reveal not only their meanings but also insights into the Eblaite society and culture.

To provide a coherent analysis, we will examine three Eblaite personal names taken from the tablet:

1. IR-DAGAN
2. EN-LIL
3. RABI-UM

IR-DAGAN:
The name IR-DAGAN (ìr-dagan) consists of two components: "IR," a logogram representing a servant or slave (ìr), and "DAGAN" (dagan), a theophoric element associated with the Mesopotamian god Dagan. Thus, this personal name can be translated as "servant of Dagan." Theophoric names, where one of the elements is derived from a deity, are widespread throughout the ancient Near East.

EN-LIL:
This name is written as en-LIL (en-líl) and combines two logograms: "EN," representing a lord or ruler (en), and "LIL," symbolizing the Mesopotamian god Enlil. "EN-LIL" can, therefore, be translated as "lord of Enlil." Names containing the Enlil element suggest the influence of the Sumerian pantheon and imply strong connections between the Eblaite and Sumerian cultures.

RABI-UM:
The name RABI-UM (ra-bi-um) is written using phonetic components. "RABI" is an Eblaite term meaning "great," while "UM" is a common Semitic element referring to a maternal figure. Thus, "RABI-UM" translates as "great mother." Names such as this one highlight the prominence of maternal figures in the Eblaite society.

Comparative analysis:
A comparative study of the personal names in the Cuneiform tablet reveals potential cultural connections in the region. The presence of Mesopotamian gods such as Dagan and Enlil in Eblaite personal names points towards shared religious beliefs and the influence of Mesopotamia on Ebla. On the other hand, the use of Semitic linguistic elements and the emphasis on maternal figures stand as evidence for local cultural traits.

Moreover, a more extensive comparative analysis involving the study of additional names, historical records, and archaeological findings may yield even richer insights into the Eblaite civilization and its connections to its contemporaries in the region.

In conclusion, Eblaite personal names tell us about the society and its cultural and religious environment. The presence of Mesopotamian gods in the names indicates the influence of neighboring regions, and the examination of the tablet's intricacies reinforces linguistic connections with other civilizations. Striking a balance between regional influence and local culture adds to the richness and complexity of the Eblaite civilization.
