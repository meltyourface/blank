The best option would be:

Incorporating a statuette to represent personal deity, a bowl of saltwater for the blending of Earth and Water energies, crystals for grounding, and a pendulum for divination purposes.

**Explanation**:

In the context of altar setups within occult practices, the goal is to represent and incorporate various elemental energies and symbols that resonate with the practitioner, allowing them to focus and manifest their intent most effectively. In this scenario, the practitioner is looking to blend Earth energies, Water energies, and their personal connection to the divine realm.

The chosen option incorporates a statuette to represent the practitioner's personal deity. This could be a specific god or goddess from their chosen pantheon, or any other symbol that embodies the divine for them. This statuette serves as a representation of the divine realm, and a focal point for their spiritual connection.

A bowl of saltwater is used to represent the blending of Earth and Water energies. Salt is a common symbol for earth and grounding, while water signifies fluidity, purity, and healing. By combining them, the practitioner is intentionally merging these two energies and symbolizing balance and harmony.

Crystals are a powerful and versatile tool in occult practices, used for their unique energetic properties. In this scenario, the practitioner utilizes crystals as a grounding and amplifying element. They can aid in establishing a connection with the earth, acting as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms.

The pendulum is used for divination purposes, allowing the practitioner to access their intuition and receive answers or guidance more directly from the divine realm. Pendulums built with specific materials related to Earth and Water can help bridge the gap and create a strong energetic link between the practitioner and their divine connection.

In conclusion, this altar setup best represents the blending of Earth energies, Water energies, and the practitioner's personal connection to the divine realm as it thoughtfully incorporates key symbols and tools that resonate with each aspect. It fosters a balanced and harmonious environment that the practitioner can use to tap into their intuitive abilities and connect with the spiritual realm more effectively.
