To complete the task of designing and constructing a Kemetic-inspired altar dedicated to establishing a profound connection with specific ancient Egyptian deities, I would proceed as follows:

1. Select the deities: For this particular altar, I would choose three deities: Isis (goddess of love and motherhood), Osiris (god of the afterlife), and Horus (god of the sky and kingship). These deities represent a divine family and are often associated with each other in ancient Egyptian mythology.

2. Determine the altar location: The altar should be set up in a quiet, dedicated space where you feel comfortable and focused. Ideally, the area should be clean and well-ventilated, and facing East to welcome the rising sun.

3. Secure authentic materials: Begin gathering materials such as sandstone, papyrus, and gold leaf. Sandstone can be used to create a sturdy base for the altar, papyrus for scrolls or inscriptions, and gold leaf for decorative elements and offerings.

4. Altar symbology: For each deity, incorporate specific symbols to create a meaningful connection.

   a. Isis: You may use a statue or representation of Isis nursing her son Horus, showing her maternal aspect. Symbols such as the Tyet, an ankh, and the sacred lotus flower can also be included.

   b. Osiris: Include a figure or statue of Osiris holding his crook and flail, which represents his power and authority. You can also incorporate the Djed pillar symbol, representing stability and endurance, and images of the sacred bennu bird (a type of heron).

   c. Horus: A statue or image of Horus, often depicted as a falcon or a man with a falcon's head, can be placed on the altar as well. Symbols to incorporate include the Eye of Horus and the sky hieroglyph.

5. Traditional offerings: Prepare traditional offerings to present on the altar, which include:

   a. Incense: Frankincense and myrrh, known for their purification properties and as a favored offering in ancient Egypt.
   
   b. Libations: Water, beer, or wine, poured into a dedicated vessel or bowl.
   
   c. Symbolic foods: Bread, fruits, vegetables, or sweets as appropriate to the deities' preferences.

6. Ritualistic ceremonies: Perform the appropriate ritualistic ceremonies to invoke the presence and favor of these powerful divine beings based on personal research and dedication. Some possible practices might include:

   a. Cleansing your space with incense or by sprinkling natron (a type of salt used in ancient Egypt for purification) around the area as an offering.
   
   b. Uttering prayers or chants in the ancient Egyptian language, addressing the deities, and seeking their guidance, protection, and blessings.
   
   c. Offering libations and symbolic foods, presenting them on the altar while stating your intentions and respect for the deities.
   
   d. Meditating and envisioning yourself in the presence of these powerful gods, receiving their wisdom and energy.

With the completion of these steps and adherence to the proper elements reflective of the chosen deities, you can achieve a profound connection with Isis, Osiris, and Horus through your dedicated Kemetic-inspired altar.
