**Explanation**:
In occult practices, altar setups play a crucial role in performing rituals and establishing a connection with the energies and forces at work. The arrangement of elements on an altar embodies the principles of balance and unity, both of which are essential in creating harmony and promoting successful outcomes.

The association between cardinal directions and elements is based on various esoteric and magical traditions, but one of the most widely accepted combinations is the one derived from the Western tradition:

1. Air in the East: Air represents mental faculties, intellect, and communication. East is often associated with the beginning of a new day, enlightenment, and new beginnings. Establishing a connection between Air and the East emphasizes the importance of clear thoughts and intentions in any practice.

2. Fire in the South: Fire symbolizes passion, willpower, and transformation. The Southern direction represents growth, strength, and the warmth of the sun. Correspondingly, Fire helps to fuel one's will and determination throughout their magical workings.

3. Water in the West: Water is associated with emotions, intuition, and the subconscious mind. The West is often linked to the end of the day, reflection, and introspection. This combination encourages an exploration of one's inner world, and the integration of emotions and intuition into their practice.

4. Earth in the North: Earth embodies stability, grounding, and physical manifestation. The North represents solitude, quiet, and the deep wisdom of the earth itself. By aligning Earth with the North, practitioners are reminded of the importance of staying grounded and connected with the tangible reality while exploring the unseen realms.

The arrangement of elements as described in option C (Air, Fire, Water, and Earth clockwise, starting from the east) respects the traditional correspondences with cardinal directions. This elemental cycle reflects the natural progression of energies and symbolizes a continuous flow between the elements, a concept that emphasizes both balance and unity.

In summary, this arrangement is the most appropriate for representing balance and unity as it respects traditional associations and effectively combines the varying energies of each element in a harmonious and logical flow.
