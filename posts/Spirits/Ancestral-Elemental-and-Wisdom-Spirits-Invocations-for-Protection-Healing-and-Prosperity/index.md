description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Spirits, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a series of six intricate invocations, each tailored to a specific category of benevolent spirits - such as guardian spirits, ancestral spirits, elemental spirits, healing spirits, wisdom spirits, and prosperity spirits. Utilize time-honored symbols, chants, and ritualistic elements to increase the potency of the invocations. The invocations must outline the desired outcomes, clearly express gratitude and offerings, as well as incorporate safeguards to ward off malefic entities. Ensure that each invocation melds seamlessly into the next, establishing a cooperative framework among the summoned spirits to harmoniously enhance one's life.

Invocation 1: Guardian Spirits

Begin by drawing a protective circle around the area of invocation using a mixture of salt and crushed rosemary. Light a white candle in the center.

Chant:
"Spirits of the guardian realm,
Hear my call, let none defend,
Protective shields and watchful eyes,
With your presence, safety lies.
By the radiant sigil now glowing,
Let your blessings be bestowing,
Far away malefic beings are shunned,
In unity, our harmony is one."

Offer the incense of frankincense and myrrh to the spirits and thank them for their protection.

Invocation 2: Ancestral Spirits

Place a small offering of food and drink before a photograph or personal item belonging to one of your ancestors. Light a black or white candle.

Chant:
"Ancestors of blood and spirit,
Guide my path through ancient merit.
Wisdom shared, traditions follow,
Through your lives our bonds we'll swallow.
Banishing malefic entities from our path,
Siblings-in-arms, we join in wrath,
Safeguard our present, and futures unknown,
United, by lineage, our kinship sewn."

Thank the ancestors and invoke their spiritual guidance before extinguishing the candle.

Invocation 3: Elemental Spirits

Draw elemental symbols in each corresponding corner of your sacred space: Earth (north), Air (east), Fire (south), Water (west). **Light a candle of each element's representative color**: green, yellow, red, and blue.

Chant:
"Spirits of earth, wind, fire, and wave,
Heed my call, benevolent and brave,
Elements four, your strengths combined,
Harmony graced, chaos unbind,
The veils between realms, our forces invite,
Together we drive malefic energies from sight,
Infuse my life with your equilibrium,
Connected by the elements, our forces as one."

Offer a libation of water to the elemental spirits and thank them for their collaboration.

Invocation 4: Healing Spirits

Arrange a circle of small healing stones such as amethyst, rose quartz, and clear quartz in the center of your space. Light a violet or blue candle.

Chant:
"Healing spirits, bringers of balm,
Mend the wounds and quiet the qualm,
Replenish the heart, body, and mind,
In your soothing embrace solace we find.
Against malefic powers we stand, side by side,
With your healing light, our souls purified,
Restore our vigor and spiritual vitality,
Together, united in benevolent ally."

Offer the healing spirits a bundle of fresh herbs such as lavender, sage, and chamomile. Thank them for their healing energy.

Invocation 5: Wisdom Spirits

Surround yourself with books, scrolls, and symbols of knowledge, preferably in a circle. Light a silver or indigo candle.

Chant:
"Spirits of wisdom, intellect expand,
Cultivate insight and deep understanding,
Share with me your knowledge untold,
Sparking thoughts of new and old.
Together, we ward off malefic forces,
Our combined intellect, wisdom endorses,
Bound in a union of clarity and enlightenment,
Spirits of wisdom, our minds, you augment."

Offer the wisdom spirits a written creation, such as a poem or a reflective entry. Thank them for their insights and guidance.

Invocation 6: Prosperity Spirits

Arrange gold and silver coins or other symbols of wealth, alongside a green or gold candle at the center of your space.

Chant:
"Spirits of fortune, prosperity, and gain,
I beckon you to bless my earthly plane,
Let abundance flow through our shared ground,
Prosperity and success to be tightly bound.
Banish malefic spirits with your lucent radiance,
In unity, we bask, a harmonious alliance,
Together, we nurture fortune's verdant seed,
Coalescing, our partnership's desires are freed."

Offer the spirits a small pouch of spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves as a symbol of bounty. Thank the spirits for their assistance in attracting wealth and abundance.

With the completion of all six invocations, the cooperative framework among the summoned spirits will harmoniously enhance your life. Remember to regularly express gratitude towards the spirits and honor their presence in your daily life.
