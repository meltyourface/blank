Meticulous Investigation of Intricate Relationships between Ancient Pagan Deities and Contemporary Occult Practices:

### I. Introduction:

The ancient pagan deities have played a pivotal role in shaping contemporary occult practices through their complex relationships and evolving archetypes. Through meticulous investigation and documentation, the deep connections between major gods and goddesses from various pantheons and their significance within the esoteric orders and secret societies become evident. With a focus on the interplay between historical context and the evolution of these ancient archetypes, the ongoing integration of these deities in the Magnum opus on occult arts can be unraveled.

### II. Pantheons: A Cross-Cultural Overview

The major pantheons and their deities have influenced and transcended their original cultural contexts, shaping esoteric and occult practices worldwide. Key pantheons include:

1. Egyptian Pantheon: Isis, Osiris, Horus, Set.
2. Mesopotamian Pantheon: Inanna, Enki, Marduk.
3. Greek Pantheon: Zeus, Hera, Athena, Hades. 
4. Roman Pantheon: Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Pluto.
5. Celtic Pantheon: Brigid, Dagda, Lugh, Morrigan.
6. Norse Pantheon: Odin, Thor, Freyja, Loki.

### III. Influence on Modern Rituals:

Each pantheon has contributed unique practices and beliefs to the contemporary occult rites and ceremonies:

1. Invocations and evocations: Drawing upon the energies and attributes of deities, particularly those associated with the elements, like Zeus (Greek) and Thor (Norse).
2. Magickal glyph and sigil work: Harnessing the power of symbols and written forms associated with deities (Egyptian hieroglyphs, Norse runes, etc.).
3. Seasonal festivals: Celebrating solstices, equinoxes, and the cycles of nature in honor of gods and goddesses linked to nature or agricultural abundance (such as Brigid and Lugh in the Celtic Pantheon).

### IV. Symbolism in Esoteric Orders and Secret Societies:

Across esoteric orders and secret societies, ancient deity symbolism infiltrates their practices. In Hermeticism, the core principle of "As Above, So Below" fully encapsulates the analogy between the macrocosm of the divine gods and the microcosm of humanity. The pillars of popular secret societies like Freemasonry, the Rosicrucians, and the Illuminati all incorporate symbols rooted in pagan mythology.

### V. Integration and Evolution of Deities as Archetypes:

Previously worshipped exclusively as gods and goddesses, many ancient deities have evolved into powerful archetypes and symbols for exploring the complexities and relationships between the spiritual and the physical. Carl Jung's theories of the collective unconscious and the integration of archetypes therein resonate with the contemporary spiritual and intellectual climate. Esoteric practitioners are drawn to the exploration of these subconscious pathways.

### VI. Ongoing Significance of Ancient Deities in Magnum Opus of Occult Arts:

Deities connect to fundamental aspects of the human experience, the sacred and the profane. The ancient gods and goddesses embody universal energies, making them essential to the Magnum opus on the occult arts. As the deities continue evolving in form and meaning, they provide new insights and connections between cultures and times, enabling practitioners to delve deeper into the mysteries of their craft.

In conclusion, the detailed analysis of the relationships between ancient pagan deities and contemporary occult practices reveals the evolving roles of these divine entities within esoteric orders and secret societies. With a keen understanding of both historical context and the ever-present interplay between spiritual and intellectual climates, one can appreciate the true depth and ongoing relevance of ancient deities within the Magnum opus on the occult arts.
