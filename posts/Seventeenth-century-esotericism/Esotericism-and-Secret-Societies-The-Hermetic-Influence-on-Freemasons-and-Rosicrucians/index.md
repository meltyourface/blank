During the Seventeenth century, the intellectual and spiritual landscape was marked by the emergence of secret societies such as the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians. These groups were deeply influenced by the esotericism of the period, particularly in relation to the ancient Hermetic philosophy, alchemy, and various mystical traditions. In this investigation, we will explore the intricate connections between these groups and the world of the occult during this period.

Hermetic philosophy, originating from the Corpus Hermeticum—a collection of texts ascribed to the mythical figure Hermes Trismegistus—played a central role in the formation of secret societies in the Seventeenth century. These texts provided the foundation for the idea of esoteric knowledge hidden from the masses and accessible only to a select few initiates. The underlying principles of Hermeticism include the idea of the macrocosm (the cosmos) and microcosm (the human being) reflecting each other, as captured in the axiom "As above, so below"; the concept of an eternal soul present in every human being; and the notion of the inherent unity and interconnectedness of all things.

The emergence of the Freemasons can be traced back to the operative stonemasons' guilds, which later evolved into speculative Masonic lodges. The Freemasons incorporated Hermetic philosophy into their rituals and symbolism, borrowing heavily from alchemical and mathematical principles. Of note are the use of the compass and square, representing the active and passive principles in nature, and the central role of the Temple of Solomon in their rituals, symbolizing the eternal pursuit of wisdom.

One of the key esoteric figures of this period was Robert Fludd, an English physician, mathematician, and alchemist who was deeply influenced by Rosicrucianism and Hermeticism. Fludd contributed to the development of both Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism through his writings and illustrations in various texts, which expounded on the value of esoteric knowledge, alchemy, and divine wisdom. His works provided a vital link between Hermetic philosophy and the secret societies he influenced.

Rosicrucianism, another secret society that emerged in the Seventeenth century, was similarly influenced by Hermetic philosophy. The Rosicrucians claimed to possess secret knowledge originating from ancient Egypt and the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, with their foundational texts – the Fama Fraternitatis, the Confessio Fraternitatis, and the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreuz – outlining their beliefs and practices. Central to these texts is the idea of a hidden fraternity working toward the spiritual and intellectual rebirth of humanity, as well as the pursuit of alchemical and spiritual transmutation.

Alchemical symbolism and practices were fundamental to the formation and development of these secret societies, with alchemy offering a rich repository of esoteric wisdom, providing the means for spiritual transformation and the attainment of divine knowledge. The alchemical process of transforming base metals into gold served as a metaphor for the spiritual transformation of the individual, which was a central tenet of both Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.

In conclusion, the intricate connections between Hermetic philosophy and secret societies such as the Freemasons and Rosicrucians during the Seventeenth century were significant, shaping their formation and development. The influence of key esoteric figures, texts, and symbols, as well as the profound impact of Rosicrucianism and alchemy on these secret societies, demonstrate the deep-rooted ties between the occult and the intellectual and spiritual pursuits of the time. These esoteric currents continue to inspire and influence modern secret societies and spiritual movements today, testifying to the enduring power of Seventeenth-century esotericism.
