The intricate stages of a 17th-century Hermetic ceremonial magic rite can be reassembled and elucidated by examining primary sources such as grimoires and manuscripts from that era. One notable example is the "Clavis Inferni," a grimoire authored by the enigmatic Cyprianus during this time. The text represents a fusion of Christianity, Hermeticism, and Kabbalah in its structure and symbolism.
**Step 1**: Preparation
The ceremonial magician begins by purifying their body and mind through a series of rituals. They cleanse themselves with water, fasting, and prayer. They inscribe sacred symbols and sigils on parchment, which will act as talismans during the ritual.
**Step 2**: Consecration of Space and Tools
The magician dedicates a ritual space, drawing a circle on the floor to represent the boundaries between the sacred and profane. The tools employed during the ceremony, such as the athame (ritual knife) and wand, are also consecrated, imbuing them with spiritual power. The practitioner may anoint themselves and the tools with holy oil.
**Step 3**: Localizing the Four Elements
The circle is divided into quadrants, each one representing an element (earth, air, fire, and water). These elements are invoked by the magician and serve as protectors and guardians of the ritual space. 
**Step 4**: Calling the Hierarchy
The magician invokes the divine presence by calling upon the various hierarchies of angels, archangels, and divine powers associated with the celestial spheres. These entities are summoned to witness and bless the ritual proceedings, and their names are often inscribed around the circle's perimeter.
**Step 5**: Inscribing Sacred Geometric Symbols
The practitioner inscribes sacred geometric symbols, such as pentacles, hexagrams, and Solomon's Seal, within the circle, on the floor, or on the invocant's body. These symbols are thought to possess spiritual energies that protect and empower the ritual.
**Step 6**: Invocations and Conjurations
The magician recites prayers, invocations, and conjurations to summon the desired spiritual entities, such as angels, daimons, or planetary intelligences. These spirits are called forth to provide guidance, wisdom, and power to the practitioner, or to assist in particular acts of magical manifestation desired by the magician.
**Step 7**: Communion with the Entity
The entity is invoked, and the magician engages in a dialogue with the spirit. They may ask for guidance, knowledge, or assistance in the manifestation of specific worldly or spiritual goals. The magician must be respectful, humble, and assertive in their interactions with the summoned entities. They may bargain or enter into pacts with these spiritual beings, which may involve promises, offerings, or acts of devotion to fulfill.
**Step 8**: License to Depart
After the communion and the completion of the ritual, the magician grants permission for the summoned entities to depart. This is done to maintain control, ensure the magician's authority, and restore the balance between celestial and mundane realms.
**Step 9**: Closing the Circle
The practitioner closes the ritual by extinguishing the candles, dispersing the elemental energies, and expressing gratitude to the divine powers. Finally, they erase the circle and any inscribed symbols, signifying the end of the ceremony and the return to the mundane world.

In conclusion, the intricate stages of a 17th-century Hermetic ceremonial magic rite involve preparation, consecration, invocation, communion with spiritual entities, and a return to the mundane. Through understanding and mastery of these esoteric practices, the practitioner can access knowledge and power from the celestial realms, influencing and manifesting their goals in the material world.
