To analyze the role of ritual, specifically the Gnostic Mass, within the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) system and its connection to Thelema, we must first delve into the background and fundamental principles of these esoteric practices. Thelema, a philosophical and religious system founded by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, is based on the key principle of discovering and accomplishing one's True Will. This system serves as the foundation for the O.T.O, which is a magical and initiatory order that utilizes spiritual practices and teachings to guide its members.

Now that we have briefly described Thelema and the O.T.O., let us examine the Gnostic Mass (also known as Liber XV or "Ecclesiae Gnosticae Catholicae Canon Missae"). The Gnostic Mass represents the central ritual of the O.T.O. and is an elaborate ceremony that symbolically enacts the union of opposites, divine and human, as well as the transformation of consciousness that arises from such union.

The purpose of the Gnostic Mass is to engage participants, known as the congregation, in a collective spiritual experience, leading to personal transformation and the realization of their True Will. Within the context of Thelema, the Gnostic Mass is a perfect vehicle for the integration of magical and spiritual practices, as it unifies the microcosm (individual) and the macrocosm (cosmic).

To understand the Gnostic Mass's engagement with both microcosmic and macrocosmic aspects, let's dive into the ritual's structure and symbolism:

1. **Structure**: The Gnostic Mass consists of a series of ritual actions, such as the proclamation of "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" and its response, "Love is the law, love under will." These actions symbolize the liberation of the individual's True Will and the recognition of the divine within oneself and others.

2. **Participants**: Key participants in the Gnostic Mass include the Priest, the Priestess, the Deacon, and the congregation. Each participant represents a specific aspect of the divine and the human, with the Priest symbolizing the active, will-driven part of the self, and the Priestess representing the receptive and intuitive aspect.

3. **The Ceremony of the Eucharist**: This part is crucial in the Gnostic Mass, as it represents the union of opposites and the transformation of consciousness. The Priestess consecrates bread and wine, symbolizing the creative forces in the universe, while the Priest consumes these sacred elements, transforming them into spiritual energy. The rest of the congregation also partakes in the Eucharist, experiencing spiritual rejuvenation and an increased state of awareness.

To summarize, the Gnostic Mass serves as a transformative ritual within the Ordo Templi Orientis system, engaging both the microcosm (individual) and the macrocosm (cosmic) through its structure, participants, and symbolism. By enacting the union of divine and human aspects, as well as the integration of active and receptive forces within oneself, the Gnostic Mass provides participants with an experience of spiritual and magical transformation, ultimately guiding them towards the realization of their True Will and a greater understanding of Thelema's principles.
