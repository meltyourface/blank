To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, we must first explore the interconnected relationships between Qabalah, alchemy, Tarot, and astrology, and then understand the historical systems and traditions where these relationships can be best observed and analyzed. We will discuss the Hermetic tradition, the Rosicrucian tradition, the Golden Dawn tradition, and the Thelema tradition. Finally, we will delve into how these systems might reveal the underlying Magickal principles governing the manifestation of reality.

1. Hermetic Tradition:

The Hermetic Tradition, rooted in the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, is one of the prime sources for understanding the interconnected relationships between Qabalah, alchemy, Tarot, and astrology. Centered around the 'Emerald Tablet' or the 'Tabula Smaragdina,' this tradition lays the foundation for the concept of "As above, so below," which emphasizes the correlation between microcosm and macrocosm, as well as the interconnected nature of the universe.

Qabalah, in this context, becomes the key to understanding the intrinsic relationship between the spiritual and physical worlds. Alchemy symbolizes the transformation and purification of the soul. Astrology serves as a blueprint for understanding the celestial influences on human life, while Tarot helps decode the symbols of the universe and serves as a tool for self-discovery.

2. Rosicrucian Tradition:

The Rosicrucian Tradition is a Western esoteric belief system that marries Christianity with Hermeticism, Gnosticism, and Neoplatonism. Its emphasis on mystical and secret knowledge makes it a suitable mantle for the study and understanding of the interconnected relationships between Qabalah, alchemy, Tarot, and astrology.

In the Rosicrucian Tradition, Qabalah serves as a way to interpret the Bible and bring awareness of the divine and spiritual within each person. Alchemy is understood as the Magnum Opus, or a spiritual path to inner perfection. Astrology explores the mind and soul through celestial correspondence, while the Tarot is a tool to invoke meditative introspection and invoke revelations from the Holy Guardian Angel.

3. Golden Dawn Tradition:

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded in the late 19th century by Freemasons William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, incorporates Qabalah, alchemy, Tarot, and astrology within its teachings. The order's curriculum and structure were designed around these disciplines to guide the initiate through different magical grades and understanding.

In the Golden Dawn system, Qabalah explains the structure of the universe and the human soul. Alchemy represents the transformative practices of elemental, planetary, and zodiacal workings essential in an initiate’s progress. Astrology helps determine the correct timing and invocations in their rituals, while Tarot forms an essential component of Golden Dawn's divination techniques and symbolic understanding of the universe.

4. Thelema Tradition:

Aleister Crowley founded Thelema, an esoteric religion, in the early 20th century. Drawing inspiration from various mystical disciplines, including Qabalah, alchemy, Tarot, and astrology, Thelema weaves these core principles into its philosophical and practical foundations.

In the Thelema system, Qabalah is used to develop an in-depth understanding of the individual's True Will. Alchemy is the process of transforming the self into the True Self, aligning with the Divine Will. Astrology charts the course for Thelemic rituals and ceremonies, while Tarot – particularly Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck – acts as a powerful divination tool, embodying Thelemic principles in every illustration.

In conclusion, the Hermetic, Rosicrucian, Golden Dawn, and Thelema traditions provide the most profound understanding of the interconnected relationships between Qabalah, alchemy, Tarot, and astrology. Within these traditions, many of Magick's underlying principles are unraveled. These systems reveal the cosmic harmony between microcosm and macrocosm, inherent divine nature, transformation and purification of the soul, and understanding our unique path of spiritual and self-development – all of which ultimately govern the manifestation of reality.
