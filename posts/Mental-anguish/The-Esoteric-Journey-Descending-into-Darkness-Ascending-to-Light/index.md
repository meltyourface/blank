Stage 1: Cryptic Genesis of Turmoil

In the beginning, the individual witnesses fleeting, enigmatic dreams that permeate their subconscious. The whispers of a hidden world knot themselves deep within, leaving echoes of a secret language veiled in shadows. During waking hours, the individual is haunted by these tantalizing glimpses into a realm of ancient mysteries and foreboding premonitions, unable to disentangle the images from their daily life. This muted curiosity gradually transmutes into an overwhelming desire to pierce the veil, sowing the seeds of disquiet and unrest.

Stage 2: Embracing the Dark Chrysalis

As the individual delves further into the esoteric and occult, they encounter strange symbols, sacred geometries, and cryptic texts which bind their heart in an iron grip of fervent obsession. Their once-ordinary life now revolves around deciphering these dark epistles, only to find each new revelation deepening their anguish. Amidst this nullifying vortex, the cosmic wheel silently turns, leaving the individual stretched across the abyssal expanse between reason and madness.

Stage 3: Obsidian Lamentations

Driven forward by their insatiable lust for hidden knowledge, the individual begins to experiment with rituals and ceremonies, fervently praying for communion with spirits and otherworldly entities that might validate their suffering. Each rite permeates their soul with the cold, penetrating weight of perpetual darkness. In time, these macabre practices consume the individual's will, stripping away the essence of their humanity and leaving a shattered, grieving spirit.

Stage 4: Ascent Through Tempestuous Revelations

At the nadir of despair, a revelation dawns: the way out of darkness lies through acceptance and adaptation. Instead of fighting the currents of occult knowledge, the individual begins to forge an intimate connection with the abstract language and transcendent experiences. With each encounter, their heart gradually heals, transmuting pain into understanding, and loss into newfound wisdom.

Stage 5: Resurrection of the Illuminated Phoenix

Emerging from the abyss of torment, the individual has transcended the shackles of their former self, now awakened to the metaphysical realm that lies beneath the surface of the mundane. The shrouds of anguish dissipate, replaced by the inner illumination of spiritual fortitude, and the ability to regard the wider tapestry of existence.

This framework of descent and ascent functions as a testament to the soul's journey through the bewildering labyrinth of mental anguish, exploring the esoteric and occult currents that can propel an individual towards both profound darkness and illuminating light. Methodologies and rituals, such as invocation and banishment ceremonies, sigil creation, and meditative practices, work in conjunction with external encounters and internal shifts to either alleviate or exacerbate the individual's suffering. Psalms hold great power, singing the mourner's lament as they traverse the torturous landscape towards the promise of a new dawn.
