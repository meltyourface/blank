excerpt: >
  1. Begin by grounding and centering yourself in your preferred ritual space, invoking the essence of Current 218 for guidance and transformative potential.

  2. Visualize each Qliphothic sphere in a vivid and detailed manner, starting with the innermost sphere, Thaumiel, and moving outwards to the final sphere, Lilith.

  3. As you visualize each sphere, take the time to connect with the specific energy, symbolism, and Dark Gods or Goddesses associated with it. For instance, when focusing on Gamaliel, evoke the presence of Lilith and Samael.

  4. As you move through the spheres, maintain a deep awareness of the Qliphothic currents that run through each of them, as well as understanding their collective role in the Current 218 system.

  5. Once you have reached the outermost sphere, draw upon the energies of each Qliphothic realm, allowing them to merge within your being, forming a powerful nexus of the Qliphothic Tree of Life aligned with Current 218.

  6. Merge these energies and channel them into your desired intention, whether it be for spiritual growth, personal transformation, or other esoteric goals.

  7. Conclude the meditation sequence by grounding and sealing the energies, thanking the deities and forces of Current 218 for their guidance and influence.

  8. Record any insights, experiences, or revelations obtained throughout the meditation for future reference or analysis.

1. Begin by grounding and centering yourself in your preferred ritual space. Light black candles and arrange them in a circle around you. Burn a blend of incense that represents Current 218 – for instance, a mixture of wormwood, myrrh, and patchouli. **Invoke the essence of Current 218 by reciting the following invocation**: "I call upon the wisdom and power of the Current 218, the Dragon of the Other Side, to guide me through this meditation and reveal the transformative potential within the Qliphothic realms. So it is."

2. Visualize a black vortex opening before you, revealing the Qliphothic Tree of Life in all its dark splendor. Begin by focusing on the innermost sphere, Thaumiel, represented by two black orbs entwined by serpentine coils, symbolizing the dual nature of this realm – both destroyer and creator. As you visualize Thaumiel, feel the energies of its ruling deities, Satan and Moloch, merging within it.

3. Moving outwards, proceed to the next sphere, Chaigidel. Envision a pulsating, crystalline orb full of chaotic energy. Connect with the god Chagidiel, who oversees the realm's destructive power and chaotic potential.

4. Travel further through the realms, visiting each Qliphothic sphere, including Sathariel, Golachab, Gha'agsheblah, Dagdagiel, A'arab Zaraq, Samael, Gamaliel, and finally, Lilith. As you journey, witness firsthand the power and energies of the deities associated with each sphere and comprehend the interconnected nature of the Qliphothic currents flowing throughout the entire Tree.

5. Upon reaching the final sphere, Lilith, visualize the Black Moon's energy. Feel the primal, feminine force of Lilith permeate your being. Allow the energies you've encountered in each realm to converge at this point, forming an intense vortex of Qliphothic energy within your being.

6. Merge these energies with your own intentions. Hold your desire for spiritual growth, personal transformation, or esoteric ambition firmly in your mind, and channel the accumulated power towards it, feeling the nexus of Qliphothic energies empower and amplify your intention.

7. To conclude the meditation sequence, take a deep breath and allow the energies of Current 218 to calm and recede. Visualize the vortex of Qliphothic realms closing before your eyes. Thank the deities, entities, and forces for their assistance and guidance, and state: "I release the power of the Current 218, and seal within me the energies I've harnessed for my intentions. So it is."

8. After completing the meditation, record your experiences in a ritual journal or diary. Include any insights, visions, or revelations you had, as well as any changes you felt in your energy, attitude, or mental state. Use this information to refine your practice, deepening your connection, and mastery over the Qliphothic Current 218 system.
