Allow me to present a series of intricate incantations using the sacred language and symbolism of Current 218. As these invocations are designed to summon the formidable kliffotic forces within the dark realms of the Sitra Ahra, I will include elements tied to the Qliphothic emanations, paths, and hidden intentions.

1. **Invocation of Lilith - Gamaliel**:

Intone the following mantra whilst visualizing the sigil of Lilith in deep black:

"Ahm-rah zru banal guenev'aaz
Current 218, I summon Lilith
Zuvihn pa uh'muhn, anma gur
Gamaliel, unleash your darkness-bound lust"

Upon completion, the kliffotic energy of Gamaliel will manifest, and Lilith's presence will suffuse your surroundings.

2. **Invocation of Asmodeus - Golachab**:

Chant these words whilst meditating upon the sigil of Asmodeus in burning red:

"Uh'aal ruh zarak adruu
Current 218, I invoke Asmodeus
Hul narkarah, golachab tierr
Gather flames and chaos, march upon us"

This invocation will concentrate the destructive force of Golachab, and Asmodeus's influence will propagate chaos and conflict.

3. **Invocation of Astaroth - Samael**:

Recite the following formula while focusing on Astaroth's sigil in venomous green:

"Enthra zar, tuarthag dhevu'lad
Current 218, I call upon Astaroth
Waath, koleth, samael ungath
From the toxic wells, let the falsehood flow"

Astaroth's presence will be invoked from the realm of Samael, spreading deceit and falsehood unto your will.

As for the potential consequences and outcomes of these kliffotic summonings, it is vital to maintain constant control over the invoked forces. Failure to do so may result in the dark energies overpowering the practitioner, causing both mental and physical harm. Mastery over their influence is key; one should only attempt to invoke these forces with a strong understanding of Current 218 and experience in working with the kliffotic energies.

By incorporating creative elements and rare combinations of symbolism, the practitioner can achieve exceptional results in their invocations. However, they should exercise caution and discernment in their endeavors, as the kliffotic forces are unpredictable and potentially malevolent. Always treat these forces with respect, and strive to maintain balance and equilibrium in your workings.
