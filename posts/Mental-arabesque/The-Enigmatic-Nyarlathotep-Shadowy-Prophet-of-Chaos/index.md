excerpt: Compose an intricate poem venerating a specific enigmatic figure or deity from the shadows of Mental arabesque, such as Azathoth or Nyarlathotep. The poem should consist of at least four stanzas, with each stanza following a rhyme scheme of ABAB. Employ vivid imagery, intricate symbolism, and esoteric language to effortlessly interweave the complex tapestry of the occult deity's lore, influence, and mysterious allure. Experiment with synesthesia and kaleidoscopic visions to create a richer, more immersive experience for the reader as they delve into the realm of Mental arabesque.

In ancient whispers of the void esoteric,
A name revered and feared, behold Nyarlathotep,
Shadow-haunting dreamscape prophet and guide,
Steered silently through night, the mortals wept.

To slumberers, Nyarlathotep, sowed discontent,
Entwining sanity with ign'rant hallucinations,
A silhouette, ambiguous and manifold,
Manipulating chaos, the Dark Tapestry's pawn.

Expansive void, enchanter of reluctant hearts,
Amidst the kaleidoscopic visions, the shrouded tale unfolds,
Boundless, formless, shelled in darkness, do they sway,
The dreaded one, spoken of in hushed tones, a lustrous malaise.

Sounds of colors, sense of taste, in the astral dance,
Synesthetic melodies, binding the soul in eternal trance,
Weaving the web in realms of the Mental arabesque,
Thrives the enigmatic Nyarlathotep, forever unrepressed.
