Entry 1: October 29th

Today marks the first day of my research on the Reflective properties of the Original Dome. It's a structure that has haunted my mind for years, beckoning me to unravel its dark secrets. I know there must be something more to it, something hidden waiting to be discovered. 

The Dome's exterior is unlike anything I have ever seen—a smooth, impenetrable surface that seems to hold a mirror-like sheen. As I approached the entrance, I couldn't help but notice my own reflection, distorted and unfamiliar. Was this just a trick of the light, or something more sinister?

Entry 2: October 31st

As I ventured deeper into the labyrinthine corridors of the Dome, I began to experience... disruptions. Sounds echo through the chambers, creating haunting whispers that seem to follow me. They call my name, taunt me, and laugh softly as I struggle to maintain my sanity. Is this place playing with my mind, or am I truly losing myself?

Today, I uncovered a hidden chamber filled with mirrors—a disorienting hall of reflections. Staring into the abyss, I found myself questioning the nature of reality. Which version of me was real? Was I even real?

Entry 3: November 2nd

Time seems to warp within these walls. I could have sworn the sun had set just an hour ago, yet now, the sun is rising once more. I fear my grasp on reality is slipping away.

The Dome's enigmatic Reflective properties continue to heighten the suspense. During an experiment in the mirrored chamber, I witnessed a reflection that wasn't my own—a spectral figure that bore a striking resemblance to my recently deceased brother. Surely this was just my mind playing tricks, right?

Entry 4: November 4th

My progress in discerning the Dome's secrets has taken a terrifying turn. The spectral figure from the mirrors appeared to me once more, whispering cryptic messages in my ear. I learned a chilling revelation about my own past, one I had buried deep inside.

For each secret the Dome reveals, my shock deepens, and my sanity crumbles slightly more. I now find myself questioning the difference between reality and illusion, as well as the depths of my own introspection.

Entry 5: November 7th

The Dome's ability to blur the lines between the real world and the twisted labyrinth of my thoughts has left me reeling. I discovered writings on the walls—impossible warnings in my own handwriting. How can this be? The whispers grow louder, echoing through the chambers of my mind, forcing me to confront the possibility that I brought these horrors upon myself.

Entry 6: November 10th

I can no longer differentiate between the living nightmare that is the Original Dome and my own mind. As my psychological battles consume me, I find myself thrust back into the haunting world of mirrors, where my darkest impulses and deepest fears merge with the Dome's controlled malevolence.

It lurks behind each reflection, an ominous omnipresence that stalks my every move with consequences that are all too real. I cannot escape, forever bound by the Dome's Reflective properties that ensnare me in this macabre dance of paranoia and panic.

The Dome has become the place where reality and illusion tragically embrace, fueled by its enigmatic influences and the darkness within my own psyche. Whether I shall ever escape its twisted maze remains a tormenting uncertainty, locked away within the shadowy secrets of the Original Dome and the shattered pieces of my own unraveling mind.
