## Planetary Hours - A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction

Planetary hours, a fundamental concept in the realm of the occult, are instrumental in mastering the art of ritual and spell work. This guide aims to provide students of the occult with a comprehensive understanding of planetary hours, their significance, calculations, and practical applications in magical practices.

The Significance of Dividing the Day and Night into 12 Periods

The division of the day, from sunrise to sunset, and the night, from sunset to sunrise, into 12 different periods each, stems from ancient astrological practices. This system, dating back to the Chaldeans and Egyptians, allowed astrologers to assess the influence and energy of various celestial bodies on human affairs.

Moreover, these divisions allowed practitioners to determine the most propitious hours for their rituals, as each hour is ruled by one of the seven classical planets: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. The energetic attributes of the ruling planets imbue the specific hours with distinctive qualities, which practitioners can harness for their magical workings.

Governing Planets Associated with Planetary Hours

The sequence of governing planets for each planetary hour follows the Chaldean Order, which is based on the descending celestial sphere's speed. The order of the planets is as follows:

1. Saturn
2. Jupiter
3. Mars
4. Sun
5. Venus
6. Mercury
7. Moon

The first planetary hour of the day is governed by the planet that rules the day of the week. For example, the first hour on a Sunday begins with the Sun, followed by Venus, Mercury, Moon, and so on. It is essential to familiarize oneself with the planetary rulers of the week to determine the governing planet for each hour:

1. Sunday: Sun
2. Monday: Moon
3. Tuesday: Mars
4. Wednesday: Mercury
5. Thursday: Jupiter
6. Friday: Venus
7. Saturday: Saturn

Calculating Planetary Hours

To calculate the planetary hours, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Determine the time of sunrise and sunset for your location.
2. Calculate the length of the day by subtracting the time of sunrise from the time of sunset. Divide this duration by 12 to determine the length of each daytime planetary hour.
3. Calculate the length of the night by subtracting the time of sunset from the time of sunrise on the following day. Divide this duration by 12 to determine the length of each nighttime planetary hour.
4. Assign each hour in the day and night to the respective ruling planet, beginning with the planet that governs the day of the week.

Practical Applications of Planetary Hours in Ritual and Spell Work

Planetary hours play a compelling role in enhancing the efficacy of rituals and spells. Each ruling planet imbues its governed hour with unique energies, which can be harnessed for specific purposes:

1. Sun Hours: Ideal for prosperity, success, and recognition spells. 
2. Moon Hours: Suitable for clairvoyance, intuition, and dream work.
3. Mars Hours: Strengthen resolve, achieve victory, and protect against adversaries.
4. Mercury Hours: Boost communication, form alliances, and enhance creativity.
5. Jupiter Hours: Attract abundance, expand knowledge, and garner influence.
6. Venus Hours: Encourage love, beauty, and harmonious relationships.
7. Saturn Hours: Cultivate discipline, manifest long-term goals, and vanquish obstacles.

Understanding and incorporating the potent energies of planetary hours is pivotal to mastering the occult, resulting in more effective rituals and enriching magical practices. By diligently adhering to the knowledge within this guide, students can harness the immense power of celestial bodies and elevate their magical workings to new heights.
