To perform this task, we need some specific details, such as the date and the location for which you want the planetary hours calculated. In the meantime, I'll provide a general guideline on how to calculate planetary hours and determine the most auspicious time for performing the tasks based on intentions and desired outcomes.

1. Determine sunrise and sunset times for the given date and location. You can use various websites and apps, such as timeanddate.com or an almanac, to find the accurate times.

2. Calculate the length of daylight and nighttime.
- To find the length of daylight, subtract the time of sunrise from the time of sunset.
- To calculate the length of nighttime, subtract the time of sunset from the next day's sunrise time.

3. Divide the time intervals.
- Divide the length of daylight by 12 to find each planetary hour for daytime.
- Divide the length of nighttime by 12 to find each planetary hour for nighttime.

4. Assign planetary rulership to hours.
- In a traditional sequence, the planetary hours rotate through the following order: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon.

Starting from the hour of sunrise, assign each planetary hour following the sequence. Once you reach the Moon, return to Saturn, and continue the cycle until all daylight hours are assigned. Proceed with the same order for nighttime hours, starting at the time of sunset.

5. Determine the best planetary hour for activities or rituals based on intentions and desired outcomes.
- Saturn: Discipline, responsibility, limitations, and dealing with authority.
- Jupiter: Expansion, abundance, growth, and success.
- Mars: Courage, willpower, strength, and conflict resolution.
- Sun: Vitality, creativity, power, and recognition.
- Venus: Love, beauty, harmony, and artistic inspiration.
- Mercury: Communication, intellect, versatility, and travel.
- Moon: Emotions, intuition, dreams, and fertility.

Select the planetary hour that best aligns with your intentions and desired outcomes for the activities or rituals you wish to perform.

Once you provide me with a specific date and location, I can provide you with the exact calculations, the planetary hours, and the best time based on your intentions.
