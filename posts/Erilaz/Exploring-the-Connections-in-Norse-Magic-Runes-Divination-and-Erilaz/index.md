To adequately address the challenge of analyzing the significance and potential relationships within the combination of Runic formulas, divination, and the role of Erilaz in Norse magic, we must first delve into the origins, characteristics, and implications of these individual elements. By making connections amongst these concepts, we can shed light on how adepts stand to benefit from a more profound understanding of this knowledge trove and its development as a Runic wisdom tradition.

Firstly, let's explore the concept of Runic formulas. These are specific arrangements or sequences of Norse runes designed to channel specific energies or results. Comprising one or more runes inscribed on objects or as part of incantations, Runic formulas hold great power in their ability to tap into the metaphysical energies that the runes symbolize, as well as in their compounding effects.

Secondly, divination in Norse magic refers to the practice of seeking hidden knowledge or gaining foresight through the interpretation of omens, often using runes as symbolic means for doing so. Norse shamans and rune-casters were highly skilled in the art of divination, attempting to foresee potential outcomes and influence decision-making through the careful observation, interpretation, and manipulation of various symbols, signs, and energies in the world.

Lastly, the Erilaz, meaning "rune-master" or "rune-versed," is a specialist in the manipulation and understanding of runes, their meanings, and their relationships with each other and the world. As an expert in the esoteric knowledge of runes, they play a crucial role within the community of Norse magic practitioners, contributing significantly to the development and propagation of Runic wisdom.

Now that we have a foundation of understanding of these individual elements, let us explore the interwoven connections and potential relationships amongst them.

The Erilaz is the bridge that connects Runic formulas and divination. As masters of the runic arts, they are adept at deciphering the energies and intricate relationships residing within the Runic formulas. They employ these formulas in divination practices, wielding the immense power encapsulated in the symbols during the divinatory process. Consequently, the Erilaz assumes a central role in the synthesis of these elements, wielding the power of Runic formulas and divination to shape theosophical understanding and its practical application.

Adeptness in the aforementioned practices would have several implications on an individual's understanding of Runic wisdom. For one, it encourages the exploration of the underlying principles governing the nature of each rune. In turn, this serves to nurture their personal relationship with the runes, fostering the blossoming of illuminated insights. Furthermore, a nuanced comprehension of the relationships between the runes allows for a more refined approach to formulating novel Runic combinations, leading to the creation of innovative formulas and new dimensions of magical power.

Such mastery also holds the potential to contribute significantly to the evolution of Runic wisdom. As adepts advance in their understanding and proficiency, they stand to uncover previously unknown connections between the runes, facilitate the development of new techniques and practices, and promulgate new schools of thought. Their experiences and insights would then be added to the growing repository of knowledge, consequently expanding the horizon for future generations of practitioners.

In summary, the significance of the intertwined triad of Runic formulas, divination, and the Erilaz lies in the dynamic power of combining these elements of Norse magical practice. Understanding these relationships enables adepts to probe deeper into the reservoirs of Runic wisdom, both enhancing their own metaphysical aptitude and contributing to the overarching growth and evolution of the age-old tradition. The key themes explored in this response include the origins and characteristics of Runic formulas, divination, and the role of Erilaz, as well as the necessity of combined understanding to facilitate personal growth and the perpetuation of expanding Runic knowledge.
