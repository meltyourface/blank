Through my expertise in the field of Erilaz, I have researched and uncovered a list of historical necromancers and the ancient tombs from which they sourced their arcane knowledge. While I cannot guarantee the veracity of all the information presented herein, I have endeavored to provide a comprehensive and accurate account of their practices, rituals, and influence on society.

1. **Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535)**: A German polymath and occult writer, Agrippa engaged in various necromantic rituals. He was known to draw inspiration from the sacred texts found in the Necropolis of Thebes.

2. **John Dee (1527-1608)**: An English mathematician, alchemist, and advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, Dee dabbled in necromantic practices. By studying the hidden tombs of Glastonbury Abbey, he discovered several arcane secrets that would later inform his work, including his development of the Enochian language.

3. **Gilles de Rais (1404-1440)**: A notorious French knight, de Rais was accused of practicing necromancy and devil worship. Though a historically controversial figure, his studies were inspired by the arcane texts hidden in the catacombs beneath Paris.

4. **Edward Kelley (1555-1597)**: An English occultist and medium, Kelley partnered with John Dee in the practice of scrying and alchemy. Kelley's knowledge of necromancy is believed to have originated from the mysterious Conclave of Shadow, a secretive gathering of necromancers whose location remains unknown.

5. **Cagliostro (1743-1795)**: An Italian alchemist and occultist, Cagliostro was known for his propensity towards necromancy. He drew upon the powers of the ancient tombs within the Catacombs of Turin, which enabled him to develop his own unique brand of sorcery.

6. **Isis the Great (dates unknown)**: An enigmatic priestess and necromancer who lived in ancient Egypt, Isis the Great was well-versed in the dark arts, reportedly obtaining her knowledge from the tombs of the Old Kingdom's necropolis.

7. **Abramelin the Mage (late 14th-early 15th century)**: A Jewish Kabbalist and practitioner of magic, most famed for the "Book of Abramelin," a grimoire that detailed various rituals and spells, including necromancy. The rumored origin of his knowledge lies within the sacred chambers of Mount Sinai.

The connections between these practitioners and the societies they influenced can be observed through the political intrigue, occult symbology, and numerous documents that have come to light over the centuries. For instance, Gilles de Rais was considered primarily responsible for inciting the Hundred Years War, while Cagliostro's esoteric practices both instigated suspicion and garnered the loyalty of influential figures. The works of John Dee and Edward Kelley, in their pursuit of scrying and alchemy, played a significant role in shaping the Elizabethan Ageâ€™s approach to esoteric matters.

These necromancers, with their arcane practices and rituals drawn from ancient tombs, played critical roles in shaping the societies they inhabited, influencing the development of occult traditions and the understanding of the mystical world. As such, their legacies continue to leave a mark on the field of occultism and the pursuit of hidden knowledge to this day.
