1. **Fundamental Principles and Theories**: 

Cabbalism, a form of Jewish mysticism, primarily revolves around the understanding of the true nature of God and the universe. Cabbalists believe in ten divine emanations or attributes (Sefirot) through which God interacts with the world. They study the sacred texts, especially the Torah, to attain spiritual insight and decode hidden meanings. The Erilaz mastery within Cabbalism would entail deep comprehension of these mystical concepts and their interrelation.

Hermetic Qabalah is an adaptation and extension of Cabbalism that incorporates various Western esoteric systems, such as astrology and alchemy. **It shares the same core concepts as Cabbalism**: the Sefirot, divine emanations, or energies â€“ each linked with an archetypal symbol, planet, or force. The Erilaz mastery within Hermetic Qabalah signifies adeptness in employing its myriad symbols and correspondences to decipher the mysteries of existence.

2. **Historical and Cultural Contexts**: 

Cabbalism emerged around the 12th century in Provence, France, and further developed in Spain with the publication of the Zohar in the late 13th century. The rise of Hermetic Qabalah traces back to the Renaissance period when European scholars rediscovered Greek and Roman mystical texts. It reached its peak with the formation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the late 19th century, an organization dedicated to the study and practice of the occult.

3. Notable Figures, Thinkers, and Practitioners:

Cabbalism's notable contributors include Isaac the Blind, Moses de Leon (author of the Zohar), and Isaac Luria. Hermetic Qabalah owes its foundations to the works of Renaissance thinkers like Pico della Mirandola, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and Marsilio Ficino. The Golden Dawn was established by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, and its influential members included Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, and Israel Regardie.

4. **Symbolism and Correspondences in Erilaz Mastery**:

In both Cabbalism and Hermetic Qabalah, the Tree of Life and its ten Sefirot serve as the symbolic framework connecting the divine and material worlds. The Erilaz mastery requires the ability to navigate this complex structure and recognize its layered correspondences, such as associations with Hebrew letters, the planets, and the Tarot cards.

5. **Impact and Influence on Popular Culture**:

Cabbalism and Hermetic Qabalah have deeply influenced various art forms, literature, and contemporary magical practices. Aleister Crowley's works, for instance, are inspired by both systems and have left a significant mark on modern occultism. The symbols and concepts of the two systems are also found in popular culture, such as movies (e.g., "The Tree of Life") and books (e.g., Jorge Luis Borges' writings).

6. **Potential Future Developments and Integration**:

As modern spiritual seekers continue to explore the boundaries of esoteric knowledge, it is likely that Cabbalism and Hermetic Qabalah will further evolve and integrate with new systems and cultural influences. The role of the Erilaz mastery in this context will be to ensure a deep understanding of underlying principles, enabling a meaningful synthesis between the old and the new, and facilitating the further dissemination of esoteric wisdom.
