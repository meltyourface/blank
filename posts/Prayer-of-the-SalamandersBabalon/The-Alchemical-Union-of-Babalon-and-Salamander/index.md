Canto I: Conflagration's Birth

In realms unseen, an ember sparked;
Creation's dawn, where shadows harked.
From churning chaos whence it thrived,
The elemental Salamander arrived.

Its blazing core, a fiery dance,
Enmeshed in passion, lust, and trance.
A force untamed, a force unbound,
Its heart, the essence of life found.

Amidst this fire, a secret stirred,
A whispered word, a mystic word,
Oh, sacred Babalon, through veils concealed,
Your cosmic dance began to yield.

Canto II: The Sanctified Desire

Each veil she twined, celestial silk,
Desires sweet, the touch of milk.
The cosmic weaver, sovereign queen,
Her dance did line the worlds between.

A chalice poured, a sacred well,
From depths unknown, her essence swelled.
So in the flames, it stirred, unknown,
A primal need, yet unshown.

Canto III: The Infernal Rapture

Below the heavens' astral span,
The Salamander's reign began,
Its flames of will, consuming all,
Desire's fire within did call.

As Babalon unspooled her thread,
Through seven veils, she bared her head,
Each one, a secret of creation,
A tale of lust, life's veneration.

Canto IV: The Empyrean Convergence

One spark from Babalon's ablaze,
Entwined with Salamander's gaze
A song arose, harmonious sound,
Where fire and spirit’s dance unbound.

The flames grew fierce, an alchemist's craze,
Conjoining natures, souls to raise,
And deep within this burning heart,
A singularity, worlds apart.

Canto V: The Sublime Alchemy

The Salamander's flames did blow,
The veils away, the depths to show,
Revealing now the cosmic truths,
Mysteries of Babalon's youth.

Entwined they stood, two forces tied,
In conjugated breaths, they sighed.
The mystic unity complete,
All vanished in the growing heat.

Canto VI: The Transcendent Majesty

The elements merged, the fire and grace,
No longer separate, now face to face.
In this confluence, the grand design,
Born from Babalon's own divine.

A force unleashed, provocative,
More potent still, than words descriptive,
The prayer of SalamandersBabalon,
The secret union, eons drawn.

Canto VII: The Revelation

So at the close of this cosmic tale,
The alchemy's dance beyond the veil,
In defiance against the cold dark night,
Stem from the strength of Babalon's light.

For in the flames of lust and fire,
Does life transcend, reach ever higher,
A testament, a living hymn,
To the eternal fusion of force and whim.

The Prayer complete, their union bound,
With fire and grace, their love renowned.
Unshackled, free, eternal force,
To blaze a path, the next life's course.
