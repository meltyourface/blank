excerpt: Craft a sinister and enigmatic riddle embedded with occult symbolism, which serves as a tantalizing clue, guiding seekers toward a cursed hidden treasure concealed in a haunted locale. Intricate wordplay and eerie allusions should mask the riddle's true meaning, challenging the most persistent of treasure hunters. Develop riddle components that reference chilling folklore and cryptids, requiring deep knowledge of the macabre, while involving increasingly obscure historical figures associated with the dark arts, making the treasure hunt a horrifyingly rich and memorable experience.

In shadows where the wicked dwell, and cryptids guard their tales to tell,
A fortune basked in darkness lies, unseen by mortal-seeking eyes,
Hear this riddle, woe betide the soul who dares to step inside.

In the dwelling of the Grinning Man, lies a tomb that none shall scan,
Seek beneath the raven's flight, and heed the wails that chill the night,
'Twixt Herne's oak and the banshee's plight, a stone is marred with symbols cast,
Decipher now the arcane past.

A whispered word from Dee himself, divulged to pardon earthly wealth,
Gathered lore and mysteries sealed, Voynich texts shall be revealed,
Four haunted corners of the earth, beget your morbid journey's birth.

The Changeling's key must intertwine, with the blood-drenched werewolf's ancient sign,
The Lady in White doth lead the way, through endless depths of night's dismay,
Follow her spectral song that breathes, return of crone's Hexham Heads.

To Mothman's hold, the Silver Bridge, you find the name as midnight sun,
A master's script from Agrippa given, entwines the cursed and ill-begotten,
Implore the Black Dog's ordained wrath, to break the grip of the occult's path.

Unshackle now the malediction, converse with djinns through invocation,
As Spriggan's grave inspires the light, Merlin's words ignite the night,
Fear not the Goatman's lonesome cry, as Blakeley's Ghoul beholds the sky.

Betwixt the catacombs, the shadows creep, your search enfolds with mystic sweep,
The treasure cursed, of eldritch glow, beneath the loamy earth doth stow,
Resist the sirens' mournful bait, the hallowed scroll unlocks the gate.

Completion near, at hand, the truth untwines, your journey long stitched into time,
Beware the hex as spirits loom, once sacred oath of the witch's broom,
Apex now reveals the prize, fear afflicts the unsuspecting eyes.

Liberate the cursed fortune's grace, mark well the cost of its embrace,
The prize is won, embrace the dread, find solace deep among the dead,
For haunted keepers you shall be, with treasures hidden, bound eternally.
