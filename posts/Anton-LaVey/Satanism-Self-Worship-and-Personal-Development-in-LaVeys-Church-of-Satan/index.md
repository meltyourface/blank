Answer: Satanism, for LaVey, was primarily a form of self-worship and a celebration of humanity's carnal nature, with symbolic and theatrical elements employed to enhance its appeal.

**Explanation**: Anton LaVey (1930-1997), the founder of the Church of Satan and the author of The Satanic Bible, was primarily influenced by his understanding of humanity's carnal nature and disbelief in supernatural beings. His approach to Satanism was not about worshiping an external, literal figure of Satan, but rather using Satan as a symbol of individualism, personal strength, and pride. In this sense, LaVeyan Satanism focused on the celebration of the self and the development of personal values that opposed conventional religious teachings.

One of the primary principles of LaVeyan Satanism is a belief in the individual's pursuit of their own desires, placing self-interest above all else. This form of Satanism does not encourage self-assurance at the expense of others, but instead, advocates for personal growth and self-awareness. This emphasis on self-worship sets it apart from other forms of Satanism that might focus on external deities or the supernatural.

To enhance the appeal of his belief system, LaVey incorporated theatrical aspects into the practice of Satanism. Rituals and ceremonies were important elements of LaVeyan Satanism, but they were intended as a form of psychodrama rather than mystical experiences or literal worship of Satan. The use of symbols, such as the inverted pentagram, and rituals served as a means to empower the individual and tap into their inner strengths.

It is essential to note that LaVey's Satanism was not focused on undermining traditional religious and social institutions without providing an alternative. On the contrary, he built a coherent system of beliefs and practices that centered around individualism and personal development. By combining elements from various sources such as Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, Ayn Rand's Objectivism, and aspects of social Darwinism, LaVey created a unique approach to Satanism that resonated with people seeking a less dogmatic and more human-centered belief system.

In summary, Anton LaVey's approach to Satanism was primarily about self-worship, celebration of humanity's carnal nature, and the employment of symbolic and theatrical elements to make it a compelling alternative for those who did not resonate with traditional religions. His focus was on individualism and personal development, rather than worshiping an external being or undermining existing beliefs without providing a coherent alternative.
