- Anton LaVey was a strong proponent of individualism and self-preservation, believing that each person should be their own highest authority.

Understanding Anton LaVey's philosophy as the founder of the Church of Satan requires a deep insight into his beliefs and principles. LaVey's strong proponent of individualism and self-preservation is central to the doctrine of Satanism, which sets it apart from other religious and philosophical systems. This statement reflects the essence of LaVeyan Satanism, which is based on the idea that each person should act as their own highest authority, instead of submitting to an external deity or dogma.

LaVey founded the Church of Satan in 1966 to create a space for those who rejected the idea of submission to a higher power. The Satanic Bible, published in 1969, outlined the basis of his philosophy. This book contains the principles referred to as the Nine Satanic Statements, which emphasize the importance of individualism, indulgence, and the pursuit of personal happiness. LaVey saw Satan as a symbol of rebellion and freedom from oppressive religious institutions, rather than a real spiritual entity.

The other options provided might seem related to LaVey's life and work, but they don't require deep insight into his philosophy:

- The fact that LaVey worked as a professional lion tamer and a crime scene photographer before founding the Church of Satan might be an interesting aspect of his biography, but it doesn't provide insight into his philosophical standpoint.
- LaVey's concept of "Psychic Vampirism" does appear in The Satanic Bible. While it could be seen as an aspect of his wider philosophy, it is not as central to understanding his belief system as his views on individualism and self-preservation.
- The inclusion of rituals and writings influenced by historical figures like Aleister Crowley and H.P. Lovecraft in "The Satanic Rituals" might be of interest to those studying the development of modern Satanism and its influences. However, it does not touch upon the core tenets of LaVey's beliefs.

To sum up, understanding LaVey's position on individualism and self-preservation as the highest moral good is key to grasping the essence of his Satanic philosophy. This principle distinguishes LaVeyan Satanism from other religious and philosophical systems and reflects the spirit of rebellion and freedom it embodies.
