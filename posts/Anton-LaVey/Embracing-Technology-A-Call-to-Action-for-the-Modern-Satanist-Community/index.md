To the Contemporary Satanist Community:

Greetings and hail Satan,

As we find ourselves in the throes of modern society, adrift in a sea of rapidly changing norms and ethics, it is paramount that we, the followers of Anton LaVey's teachings, continue to uphold the principles he advocated in his seminal work, the Satanic Bible, and work together to strengthen our community bond.

At the heart of LaVeyan Satanism lies an understanding of the intrinsic animal nature of human beings. We must ensure our beliefs remain true to this core tenet and are rooted in individualism, rational self-interest, and personal responsibility. By embracing the Ego, the 'self,' as our most sacred principle, we prioritize our own growth, success, and happiness. Let us be wary of being swayed by the herd mentality or society's moral dictates, as we alone hold dominion over our actions and decisions.

As staunch supporters of individualism, we recognize the value of diversity and stand against the growing tide of discrimination and prejudice that threatens the very essence of our beliefs. It becomes our mandate to actively fight against these oppressive forces, whether it be racism, sexism, or other forms of discrimination within our society. By doing so, we strengthen our community bond and foster understanding amongst our members.

In an age dominated by technology and social media, we must adapt our practices to connect with a new generation of seekers. We should leverage the power of the internet and the plethora of digital resources available to us to spread our message and support our community. Encouraging responsible discussion, study, and practice of LaVeyan teachings across available platforms will help us grow, learn, and evolve.

As Satanists, we must also strive to foster positive dialogue with non-Satanists and present the true nature of our beliefs, dispelling the myths and misconceptions that surround them. By engaging in open and respectful conversations with others, we build bridges and create opportunities for mutual understanding, fostering respect and tolerance within the larger society.

We must acknowledge the challenges that our community faces, with a significant factor being our very existence. As Satanists, we are often ridiculed, discriminated against, or simply misunderstood, but we must not let these trials dampen our resolve. It is precisely in the face of adversity that our spirit and dedication to our beliefs are put to the test.

Embracing technology to perform our rituals and celebrations can enhance our experience and reach. Virtual reality, AI, and other digital tools can elevate our practices and create immersive and transformative experiences. Let us examine and adopt these innovations while remaining mindful of their potential impact on our privacy, safety, and the quality of our interpersonal connections.

We live in a time when our foundational beliefs - reason, radical self-expression, and the worship of the selfâ€”are simultaneously more relevant and more threatened than ever. We, the contemporary Satanist community, must come together to face these challenges and forge our way into the future. Let us preserve and promote our core values and principles, for in their steadfast practice shall we reshape our world.

In the name of the Infernal King and our Satanic heritage, let us be bold, relentless, and unyielding.

Hail Satan!

A Fellow Devotee of Anton LaVey's Teachings
