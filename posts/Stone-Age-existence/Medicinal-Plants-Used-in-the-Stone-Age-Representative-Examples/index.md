Due to the vast expanse of time associated with the Stone Age (roughly 3.4 million years ago to 8700 BCE) and the variety of environments that our ancestors inhabited, it is impossible to compile an exhaustive list of native plants, herbs, and fungi. However, I can present a range of representative examples from various regions to give a sense of the species that may have been used medicinally during this era.

1. **Plant**: Willow (Salix spp.)
Medicinal properties: Anti-inflammatory, analgesic
Traditional preparation: Bark and leaves made into a poultice or chewed
Dosage: Variable depending on the ailment and individual
Rituals/ceremonies: The tree's link to water sources might have symbolized renewal and cleansing during healing ceremonies.

2. **Plant**: Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus)
Medicinal properties: Immune system support, antioxidant
Traditional preparation: Consumed as a tea or grated into fine powder
Dosage: Variable depending on the ailment and individual
Rituals/ceremonies: The chaga tree could have been used as a symbol of resilience, as the mushroom is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in tough conditions.

3. **Plant**: Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale)
Medicinal properties: Diuretic, liver tonic
Traditional preparation: Leaves, roots, and flowers consumed raw or steeped in hot water
Dosage: Variable depending on the ailment and individual
Rituals/ceremonies: The dandelion's ability to thrive in various environments might have been revered by shamans, signaling hope for ailing individuals seeking healing.

4. **Plant**: Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)
Medicinal properties: Anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, wound healing
Traditional preparation: Leaves and flowers applied topically as a poultice or crushed for their juice
Dosage: Variable depending on the ailment and individual
Rituals/ceremonies: Yarrow's connection to the warrior Achilles may have been known in ancient times, invoking the power of legendary fighters to heal wounds.

5. **Plant**: Wild garlic (Allium ursinum)
Medicinal properties: Antiviral, antibiotic, lowers blood pressure
Traditional preparation: Leaves and bulbs consumed raw, cooked, or crushed into a paste
Dosage: Variable depending on the ailment and individual
Rituals/ceremonies: Wild garlic's pungent fragrance could have been used to ward off evil spirits or cleanse a sick individual's environment.

6. **Plant**: Nettle (Urtica dioica)
Medicinal properties: Anti-inflammatory, diuretic
Traditional preparation: Leaves and stems boiled in water for consumption as a tea or soup
Dosage: Variable depending on the ailment and individual
Rituals/ceremonies: The stinging capabilities of the nettle plant may have been used to symbolically release pain from the body during ceremonies.

It is crucial to acknowledge that each of these plants and fungi, as well as their proposed rituals and ceremonies, have only been hypothesized. It is difficult to determine exact preparation methods, dosages, or rituals observed by Stone Age shamans without concrete evidence or existing records. However, these examples demonstrate how these plants and fungi could have been used medicinally and spiritually by our ancestors.
