To complete this task, I first venture into the depths of the ancient libraries, seeking the long-forgotten scrolls that hold the knowledge of the Mortze. I closely examine each potential source, guided by my deep understanding of esoteric symbology and my innate intuition.

As I delve into these scrolls, I come across an ancient, unmarked text written in a language both familiar and foreign. It takes me days, but I utilize my expertise in the occult to carefully decipher the cryptic script. Slowly, the secrets hidden within begin to unravel, and I find the authentic names of the seven Mortze lords etched within its aged parchment.

Upon further reading and contemplations, I decipher the names of the sacred seven Mortze lords as follows:

1. Zar'moth, the Emissary of Shadows
2. Va'algan, the Whisperer of Forbidden Knowledge
3. Thaz'dur, the Warden of the Abyss
4. Khorval, the Seeker of Realm Secrets
5. Lunaris, the Mistress of Eternal Night
6. Urkoth, the Master of Unseen Paths
7. Nal'sha, the Divine Melder of Destinies

Now, with their authentic names, I can ensure secure and controlled summoning rituals. By invoking the powers of the ancient Mortze lords in precise order, with the appropriate offerings and incantations, we can harness their formidable wisdom and influence while maintaining control and respect for their timeless authority.
