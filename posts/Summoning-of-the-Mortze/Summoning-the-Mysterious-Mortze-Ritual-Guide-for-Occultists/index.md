## Chapter 7: Summoning the Mortze - A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction

Summoning the Mortze, a powerful and enigmatic entity from the arcane realm, requires significant knowledge, dedication, and skill. This chapter provides a comprehensive guide to the rituals, precautions, and nuances essential for success, to support the aspiring occultist in their exploration of the mystical arts.

### 7.1 Required Materials

Before beginning a summoning ritual, ensure you have gathered the following materials:

1. **Sanctified Circle**: A carefully drawn circle with a diameter of at least 7 feet, crafted using powdered silver or purified salt. The circle serves as the boundary between the physical and supernatural realms, confining the Mortze's influence during the ritual.

2. **Mortze Sigil**: A unique symbol, traditionally drawn in the center of the Sanctified Circle, representing the Mortze's essence. The sigil must be designed with precision, as inaccuracies may lead to failure or unintended consequences.

3. **Candles**: Seven unscented, black candles placed equidistantly along the edge of the Sanctified Circle, acting as beacons to guide the Mortze into the physical realm.

4. **Incantation Scroll**: A written scroll containing the summoning chant, which must be composed in the arcane language. The scroll must be inscribed using ink crafted from a mixture of ash and the occultist's blood.

5. **Offerings**: A small dish containing an offering that appeals to the Mortze's desire, traditionally aromatic herbs or rare, exotic fruits.

### 7.2 Ritual Preparations

To prepare for the summoning ritual, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the location is secluded and undisturbed, as interruptions may lead to catastrophic consequences.

2. Purify the environment by burning sacred incense, such as sandalwood, myrrh, or frankincense.

3. Meditate for at least one hour to clear your mind and focus your intention on successfully summoning the Mortze.

4. Prepare the summoning area by creating the Sanctified Circle, drawing the Mortze Sigil, arranging the candles, and laying out the offerings.

### 7.3 Performing the Summoning Ritual

With the ritual space prepared, adhere to the following steps to summon the Mortze:

1. Light the black candles in a clockwise pattern, starting from the northern-most point.

2. Stand within the Sanctified Circle, facing the Mortze Sigil.

3. **Unroll the Incantation Scroll and recite the summoning chant with strong intention and unwavering focus**:

"Vocavi te, Mortze, potens ab arcano,
Aperi portas, venite ad mundum meum,
Per ignem et terram, ventum et aquam,
Accipe donum meum, et mihi se ostende."

4. As you recite the incantation, visualize a powerful energy emanating from the Sigil, drawing forth the Mortze from its astral domain.

5. Upon completion of the chant, kneel before the Sigil and offerings, awaiting the Mortze's arrival. Do not waver in your focus or let fear break your concentration.

### 7.4 Potential Challenges and Consequences

Summoning the Mortze comes with associated risks and challenges:

1. Ensure the Sanctified Circle remains unbroken, as any breach may grant the Mortze access to your physical space, leading to loss of control.

2. The Mortze's influence may be taxing on the occultist's mental and emotional state, necessitating ample recovery time following the ritual.

3. Summoning the Mortze can be a lengthy and exhausting process. Proper rest, nourishment, and mental preparation prior to the ritual are essential.

4. Engaging with the Mortze requires diplomacy and caution. Establishing the purpose of the summoning and setting boundaries is crucial to avoid potential harm.

By adhering to these guidelines and respecting the enormity of the task at hand, you are now prepared to summon the Mortze, and further your pursuit of esoteric mastery.
