excerpt: > 
  Design a meticulously detailed diagram of a protective circle, specifically tailored for the summoning of the enigmatic Mortze entity. Incorporate precise geometric formations, potent arcane symbols, and relevant elemental associations to fortify the circle's safeguarding power. Additionally, incorporate the intricate balance of celestial alignments and temporal aspects to enhance the potency of the summoning and ensure the successful conjuring of the Mortze.

To design the protective circle for the summoning of the enigmatic Mortze entity, we will first create a basic outline and then fill in the specific elements. The circle will feature six layers of protection, assembled concentrically from the outermost boundary to the innermost.

1. **Outer Boundary**: Draw a large circle delineating the perimeter of the protective space. This circle represents the physical boundary and should be inscribed in salt, which is known for its purifying qualities and the ability to ward off negative energies.

2. **Elemental Defense**: Between the outer boundary and the next concentric circle, draw the symbols representing the four elements - Earth (a downward-pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it), Air (an upward-pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it), Fire (an upward-pointing triangle), and Water (a downward-pointing triangle). These elemental symbols serve to reinforce the stability and balance of the protective space and further strengthen the circle's safeguarding power.

3. **Geometric Protection**: Inside the elemental barrier, inscribe a dodecagram, or twelve-pointed star, symbolizing the unity of the microcosm and macrocosm. This geometry connects to the cosmic order and aids in harnessing celestial energies during the summoning process.

4. **Temporal Aspect**: At each intersection of the dodecagram, place twelve small circles representing the hours of a clock. This symbolizes the temporal aspect of the summoning process and corresponds with the ideal time to summon the Mortze (midnight). Additionally, inscribe the phases of the moon in the twelve spaces within the dodecagram, emphasizing the lunar influence on the Mortze's summoning.

5. **Celestial Alignment**: Within the dodecagram, inscribe an ouroboros, or a serpent biting its tail, to represent the cyclical nature of the Mortze's influence. In the center, place the planetary symbol for Saturn, as it governs the deeper mysteries and hidden knowledge that the Mortze encompasses.

6. **Inner Protective Circle**: Finally, within the ouroboros and Saturn symbol, draw another circle filled with the runic alphabet, a powerful tool for establishing a connection with the Mortze. This circle serves as the final layer of protection and focus for the summoning ritual.

When performing the summoning, ensure that the ritual is conducted during a new moon at midnight, as this is the optimal time for harnessing the Mortze's power. With this detailed protective circle in place, the summoning process is enhanced and fortified, ensuring the successful conjuring and control of the enigmatic Mortze entity.
