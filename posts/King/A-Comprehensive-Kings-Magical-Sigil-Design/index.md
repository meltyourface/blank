  Devise an intricate King's magical sigil that embodies the arcane knowledge of the occult. The sigil must prominently feature emblems or symbols specific to King's domain, such as crowns, scepters, and regalia. Incorporate elements of numerology, sacred geometry, and ancient cultural influences to enhance its mystical power and complexity.

I have devised a powerful and intricate King's magical sigil, incorporating symbols and elements from various fields of arcane knowledge. The sigil features a circular design representing wholeness, unity, and eternity. The border of the circle is composed of eight segments, with each symbolizing a critical aspect of the King's domain.

1. First, a crowned and regal lion representing the King's courage, pride, and leadership.
2. A scepter topped with a radiant gem, symbolizing the divine power bestowed upon the King.
3. An orb embodying the King's wisdom and worldly dominion.
4. A chalice signifying the King's virtues and spiritual connection, overflowing with magical energy.
5. A crackling lightning bolt, symbolizing the King's electro-magnetic power to command the elements.
6. A pentagram, an emblem representing the King's mastery over the five elements and alchemical magic.
7. The number 9 in the center of the sigil represents completion, spiritual enlightenment, and the power of creation.
8. An intertwined, double-helix formation, enclosing the sigil in sacred geometry and enhancing its complexity.

The sigil's design incorporates the divine proportions of the golden ratio, providing it with a sense of balance and harmony. The intricate interplay of lines and shapes reflects the intricate web of knowledge and energy that the King has access to.

The sigil also draws upon ancient influences from various cultures. Astrological symbols are placed at the cardinal points, guiding the King's connection with celestial energies. Additionally, runes from the Elder Futhark and Ogham script are inscribed throughout the design, imbuing it with the strength of ancient wisdom.

This unique King's magical sigil serves as a potent talisman for the practitioner, unlocking the arcane mysteries of the world and channeling immense power to command and create. Through deep contemplation and focused intent, the practitioner can harness the full spectrum of the sigil's potential and step into their role as a true Sovereign.
