In order to address the knowledge challenge at hand, let us begin by examining the historical context and ritualistic uses of each mentioned plant: the Mandrake root, Belladonna, and Wolfsbane, alongside the intersections between their disease-causing properties and the realms of occultism and esotericism. We will then explore these relationships and contextualize them within a broader understanding of spirituality and the physical world.

The Mandrake Root, often associated with its human-like shape and intricate root system, holds a rich history in various ancient cultures, particularly in Hebrew, Greek, and Roman traditions. Mandrake was used in rituals for its narcotic and hallucinogenic properties, where high doses were known to cause delirium and even death. Owing to these effects, it has been utilized in rites for divination, fertility, and as a means of communing with the gods and spirits.

The Belladonna, or "Deadly Nightshade," holds similar qualities to the Mandrake root. Its significance lies in its strong ties with the whimsical world of witches, as they used the plant for their flying ointments due to its psychoactive and potentially lethal properties. The atropine found in its leaves and berries is known to cause intense hallucinations, delusions, paralysis, and upon ingestion or topical use, it can ultimately lead to death. This dual nature of the plant made it a potent tool in the practices of sorcery and witchcraft.

Wolfsbane, also known as Aconite or Monkshood, is a plant with a long and complex history of use in warfare, poisons, and mystical practices. The alkaloid aconitine causes paralysis and death, making it a popular choice among assassins and warriors in ancient times. Its role in occultism and esotericism lies in its association with werewolves and shape-shifting, where practitioners often utilized this plant to invoke animal spirits or divine protection.

Now, analyzing the intersection between the disease-causing properties of these plants and their use in occult and esoteric practices, we see a common theme: the exploration of altered states of consciousness and the manipulation of physiological and mental states. These plants have the ability to change the way an individual perceives reality, either through their hallucinogenic properties or their potentially lethal qualities.

An example to help elucidate this point is the ritualistic use of the Mandrake root in divination practices. The practitioner may consume small doses of the plant in order to induce hallucinogenic states, allowing them to perceive and interpret otherworldly visions or messages that they believe to originate from sacred or divine entities. Alternatively, the Belladonna and Wolfsbane plants may be used to evoke a sense of physical transformation or metaphysical transcendence.

In summation, the historical contexts and ritualistic uses of Mandrake root, Belladonna, and Wolfsbane can all be connected through their disease-causing properties and interactions with both the spiritual and physical dimensions. These plants have been used throughout history for their mind-altering and potentially lethal effects, allowing practitioners to explore altered states of consciousness, commune with gods and spirits, and manipulate their own or others' physiological and mental states. The exploration of these plants in occultism and esotericism thus harbors a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the human condition, as well as the often blurred lines between life, death, and the mysteries of the spiritual world.
