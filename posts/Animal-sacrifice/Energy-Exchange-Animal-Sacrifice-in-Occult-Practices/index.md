The correct answer is:

- It functions as an exchange of energy, often for receiving blessings or invoking spiritual entities

**Explanation**:

Animal sacrifice within the context of occult practices is not about inflicting harm or causing suffering, but an exchange of energy and a way of remembering and honoring the cyclical nature of life and death. It has been a part of human spiritual practices for thousands of years and is still practiced today in various forms throughout the world by different cultures and religious groups.

In ancient cultures such as the Aztecs, Egyptians, and Greeks, animal sacrifices were performed as a way to connect with gods and deities. It was believed that the act of taking an animal's life and offering it to a higher power symbolized an exchange of life force and energy. The animal's death would, in turn, bring blessings, protection or assistance to the caster and/or their community.

Throughout history, different cultures have utilized animal sacrifices for different purposes. For example, in Vodou and other Afro-Caribbean religions, sacrifices to the spirits (lwa) are an essential part of their religious ceremonies. This exchange of energy allows the lwa to manifest in the physical world and perform tasks on behalf of the practitioner.

It is essential to understand that animal sacrifice in the context of occult practices is not a one-size-fits-all concept. The intent, purpose and specific rituals differ depending on the tradition and beliefs of the practitioner. For instance, in some Wiccan practices, the "sacrifice" is symbolic, with no actual harm coming to the animal. The animal is then released, as a symbol of "return-to-nature" and cycle completion.

Furthermore, contrary to the popular belief that animal sacrifice is exclusively associated with dark arts, it can also be used in positive, healing or protective contexts. This can be seen in some shamanic or indigenous practices where an offering is made to ensure a good harvest or to ward off malevolent spirits.

In conclusion, animal sacrifice within occult practices often functions as an exchange of energy to invoke spiritual entities or receive blessings. This exchange is not about causing suffering, but rather connecting with the life force and understanding the cycle of life and death. Each practitioner's specific traditions and rituals will vary as this ancient practice is rooted in numerous cultures and belief systems throughout history. Also, it is important not to misinterpret animal sacrifice solely as a dark art, as it can also be applied in positive and healing contexts.
