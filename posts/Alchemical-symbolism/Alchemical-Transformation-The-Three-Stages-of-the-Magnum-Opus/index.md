excerpt: Compose an enigmatic conundrum infused with the arcane wisdom of alchemical symbolism, artfully encompassing the principles of the Magnum Opus and the stages of Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo. Incorporate within the riddle a veiled reference to a significant alchemical element, such as the Philosopher's Stone or the Elixir of Life, that will elucidate the seeker's path towards spiritual and material mastery.

In shadows deep, where secrets sleep, a riddle weaves its thread,
With steps three-fold, a tale unfoldsâ€”Magnum Opus dream to wed.
Seek ye the light, through blackest night, where symbols whisper, beckon,
The Nigredo first, a soul immersed, to purify, to reckon.

Faces bright and moon's pure light, the second stage appears,
In Albedo's glow, with wisdom slow, the dross abates, it nears.
Yet sun and rain, through joy and pain, endure as one in union,
To force give birth, upon the earth, in balanced, sweet communion.

Embrace the dawn, as ember yawns, awakened deep in Rubedo,
The Phoenix flies, aged in wise, redemption's final credo.
In hidden flame, a power claimed, elixir veiled in verse,
A potent draught, that countless sought, true riches to traverse.

Oh, cunning gem, thy secret hemmed, of legend, hushed in lore,
Transforming base, transcend the race, thy face forevermore.
What be the cure, the essence pure, in mystics' tongues concealed?
Seek answers soon, in turning moon, with heart and mind, wide peeled.
