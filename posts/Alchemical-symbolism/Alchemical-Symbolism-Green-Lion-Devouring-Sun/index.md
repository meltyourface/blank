The Green Lion devouring the Sun.

The Green Lion devouring the Sun represents a significant stage in the Magnum Opus, the alchemical process that aims to transform base metals into gold. This symbol is part of a broader set of allegories and metaphors used to communicate alchemical wisdom and knowledge. To fully understand the meaning behind the symbolism, it's essential to delve into the context of alchemical theory, the process of the Magnum Opus, and the relevance of the other symbols mentioned.

Alchemy, both a protoscientific and philosophical discipline, focuses on the transmutation of substances and the search for the Philosopher's Stone, which enables said transmutation. The Magnum Opus, or the Great Work, is the ultimate objective of the alchemist, comprising several stages to produce the Philosopher's Stone.

The Green Lion devouring the Sun corresponds to the vitriol phase of the Magnum Opus, wherein the otherwise toxic green vitriol or sulphate acts as a solvent, dissolving the impurities in the base metals. The Sun traditionally represents gold, which is the metal the alchemist seeks to create. The act of the Green Lion consuming the Sun is indicative of the substance's capacity to dissolve gold, revealing its constituent parts, which can then be manipulated to perform transformation.

The other symbols hold significance within alchemy as well but do not directly represent the transformation of base metals into gold. The Red Rose growing from the cross symbolizes the union of opposites, specifically the red masculine Principle of Sulfur and the white feminine Principle of Mercury. The White Eagle soaring above the Earth represents the volatile nature of spirit, emphasizing the alchemical process of sublimation. Lastly, the Blue Serpent entwined around the Tree of Knowledge is an allusion to the Hermetic axiom "As above, so below," stressing the interconnectivity of microcosmic and macrocosmic aspects of the universe.

In conclusion, the Green Lion devouring the Sun earns the distinction of being the alchemical symbol most closely associated with the transformation of base metals into gold. This emblem signifies a key stage in the Magnum Opus, capturing the essence of the alchemical process to produce the Philosopher's Stone and, ultimately, achieve gold.
