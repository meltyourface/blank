excerpt: >
  Design an ancient Spoken charm rooted in the clandestine practices of occult sorcery for the purpose of achieving near-perfect invisibility and evading unwanted scrutiny. Incorporate the following intricacies for a more potent and versatile incantation: \n\n1. Detail the specific phonetic pronunciations, intonations, and cadence required to effectively manifest the invisibility charm.\n\n2. Incorporate elements from a variety of esoteric and cultural sources, such as ancient Latin, medieval runes, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, to imbue the charm with a rich historical essence.\n\n3. Conceive a set of customizable options within the charm to grant the user control over the degree of invisibility (e.g., full invisibility, partial transparency, or only cloaking one's presence from specific individuals).\n\n4. Formulate a time constraint or reversion clause within the incantation that requires the user to periodically reaffirm the charm, thus preventing indefinite use and challenging the practitioner's mastery of the Spoken art.

I present to you the Invisibilia Cantus Charm:

1. Phonetic Pronunciations, Intonations, and Cadence:
The conjuration of this charm begins with a deep, resonant hum, gradually evolving into a melodic chant filled with rolling Rs, lilting Ls, and soft, haunting vowel sounds. The cadence must be held steady, akin to the beats of a rhythmic drum. Mastery of this enchantment resides in the user's ability to precisely evoke the intended phonetic elements while maintaining a meditative state.

2. Esoteric and Cultural Elements:
Drawing from diverse historical sources, the charm seamlessly integrates Latin phrasings, medieval runes, and Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Latin incantation "Absconditus velatusque" conveys the core theme of concealment, while a string of medieval runes adds further potency. Woven throughout are vocalized Egyptian hieroglyphics, which connect the charm to the magnetic energies of the ancients.

3. Customizable Options:
To harness the charm's full potential, practitioners may incorporate specific modifications that grant additional control over the degree of invisibility. Each alteration could be encoded in a series of three runes or hieroglyphs appended to the incantation:

- Full Invisibility: ᚱᚢᚾᛖ + 𓂋𓐍𓏏
- Partial Transparency: ᚱᚢᚾᛖ + 𓂋𓆑𓆗
- Cloaking from Specific Individuals: ᚱᚢᚾᛖ +  𓂋𓅜𓏜 (followed by a mental image of the person you wish to evade)

4. Time Constraint and Reversion Clause:
To prevent indefinite use of the Invisibilia Cantus Charm, a temporal restraint is embedded within the incantation. The spoken phrase "Tempus fugit" serves as a reminder of time's fleeting nature. After a duration of one hour, the charm will gradually fade, its efficacy diminishing until the user is fully visible once more.

To continue harnessing the power of invisibility, the practitioner must reaffirm the charm before the hour elapses, blending the repetition seamlessly into the ongoing incantation. This test of skill and focus prevents misuse and maintains the delicate balance of the Spoken arts.
