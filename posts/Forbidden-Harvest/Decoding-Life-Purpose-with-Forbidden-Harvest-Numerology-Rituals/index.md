To decode the obscured meaning of one's life purpose using Forbidden Harvest numerology, we must first acquire the individual's birth chart. With this information, we can perform a series of rituals to unveil the corresponding numerical values tied to one's destiny. Below is the sequence of intricately devised rituals using Forbidden Harvest numerology that will lead us to the final goal.

1. Gathering of Birth Chart Elements: 
First, obtain the exact time, date, and location of the individual's birth. This information will be crucial for developing an accurate representation of their astral birth chart.

2. Construction of the Astral Wheel Chart:
Using the previously gathered information, construct an astral wheel chart that displays the positioning of planets, Moon, and Sun at the exact moment of birth. Take special note of the astrological houses and their associated numbers.

3. The Planetary Sigil Ritual:
For each planet in the astral wheel chart, craft a sigil - a symbol that represents the essence of the planet and its astrological influence. By doing so, the hidden energies within each sigil will be awakened, allowing the deep arcane knowledge they possess to be accessed.

4. Assigning the Numerical Values:
Assign each planet of the astral wheel chart a corresponding numerical value based on its natural ruling number in Forbidden Harvest numerology. This information will be vital in deciphering the concealed messages within the birth chart.

5. The Ritual of Circle of the Numbers:
Using the assigned numerical values, create a circle with the numbers evenly placed around the perimeter. Then, trace lines between numbers based on the aspects found in the birth chart (for example, squares, trines, sextiles, oppositions). This will cause the lines to interlink in a specific pattern, revealing a hidden numerical sequence.

6. The Median Ritual:
Find the median of the newly created sequence by adding the numbers up and dividing by the total number of values. This new number represents the numerological essence of one's life purpose, a critical waypoint on the map to self-realization.

7. The Anima and Animus Ritual:
Now, divide the numerical essence of the life purpose obtained in the previous ritual by the Sun and Moon numbers in the birth chart. This will result in two new numbers, representing the female (anima) and male (animus) energies that influence the individual's life.

8. The Decoding of the Hidden Messages:
Utilizing the newly acquired numerical information, delve into the ancient Forbidden Harvest texts to uncover the concealed meanings these numbers hold. Meditate on these numbers and ponder how they manifest in the individual's life, as well as the messages they convey about one's true life purpose.

9. Return to the Astral Wheel Chart:
Consult the astral wheel chart once more, drawing attention to the houses and their associated meanings. Consider the results of the previous rituals and recognize how the decoded numerical information aligns with the various aspects and houses of the chart.

10. The Final Ritual of Revelation:
Lastly, consolidate all the acquired knowledge, findings, and wisdom gained from the previous rituals. Through deep introspection, contemplate the precise connection between the revealed numerical values and the individual's destiny. Emit the energy obtained from these revelations back into the cosmos, imprinting the newfound understanding on the universe.

By following this intricate sequence of Forbidden Harvest numerology rituals, one can decode the obscured meaning of their life purpose, unearthing the hidden messages within their birth chart. The results could reveal not just one's destiny but also offer profound insights into their unique journey through life.
