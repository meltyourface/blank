  Under a veil of silver light aglow,
  Upon this hallowed hour of twilight's kiss,
  We gather 'neath the waxing moon's ascent,
  Beneath the stars that, piercing, weave their ancient mystic dance.
  
  From depths of Earth's embrace, now rise,
  The forces hidden 'midst the untamed wild,
  Rewild our hearts and guide our steps,
  Through tangled wooded paths untrod.
  
  Inhale the scent of sacred sage and vervain's purer air,
  Let thistle free the binding ties, and rosemary cleanse our cares,
  With mugwort's call, unlock the gates to realms unseen, untold,
  And nettles to protect and heal, their ancient truths unfold.
  
  Great Bear, our guide, rekindle strength, and Wolf, unbridled Howler,
  Reveal our primal force within that we may walk in power.
  Swan the grace, seek transformation; Crow the gatekeeper wise,
  Vervain is the Savior; Sage our true heart will arise.
  
  As Luna's silver light doth shine upon our eager gaze,
  Hail, ancient gods and goddesses, join proud our mystic praise,
  Diana the huntress holds The key to the virgin wild,
  Cernunnos, lord of wooded dance, through primal eyes, we're beguiled.
  
  With wind and flame, and earth and sea, these elements intwine,
  They birth the cosmic tapestry, harmonious their entwine.
  Fire's flicker, air's sweet breath; earth's embrace and water's flow,
  Together weave their ancient tale, the endless ebb and grow.
  
  Oh, celestial forces nigh, within, without, and 'round,
  Awaken now our soul's true path, to Earth and Spirit bound,
  Manifest desires untold, as we chant this moonlit verse,
  With reverence to the sacred powers, for wisdom to immerse.
  
  Feel the pulse â€˜tween wax and wane, the balance of the tides,
  The primal rhythm on which we ride, let wild our essence thrive,
  In whispers soft, like the rustle of leaves, we weave this lunar rhyme,
  Eternal as the endless dance of Earth and Moon's embrace.
