The legendary mythos in question revolves around the ancient tale of Astarania, a realm where celestial beings and arcane symbols deeply intermingle to create an intricate narrative. Astarania itself is a plane existing beyond the veil of our reality, where astral entities engage with orators of the occult and shape the very fabric of the story. The myth takes place during a period of immense upheaval, both in the celestial realm and the realm of mortals.

The celestial beings present in Astarania's mythos bear unique traits and attributes. Some are aligned with elemental forces like fire, water, air, and earth. Others possess dominion over concepts such as time, fate, and wisdom. In Astarania, these celestial beings communicate through magically-charged incantations, delivered via oral tradition by skilled orators of the occult.

One prime example of such an orator would be Zephyra, the Echo of the Stars. She serves as a bridge between the astral entities and mortals, reciting incantations that guide the narrative progression and directly impact the world. Characters' destinies depend on Zephyra's words, which channel the will of the celestial beings.

The relationships between these astral entities represent a delicate balance of power and influence. Some beings strive for harmony, while others seek chaos. The incantations the orators recite often reflect the nature of the entities involved, leading to dramatic clashes and symbolic representations of different ideologies and struggles.

Within this mythos, arcane symbols permeate both the thoughts and actions of the characters. These symbols hold great power and are invoked by the orators to manipulate energy, modify the environment, and transform the very nature of reality. The esoteric symbology plays a significant role in the myth's intricacies, and these cosmic sigils carry meanings beyond their visible form.

These ancient symbols operate on two levels. On a surface level, they interact with the beings in the story, binding them to promises, alliances, or oaths. On a deeper level, they reflect the nature of the celestial force they represent, forging a connection between the symbol and the astral being. These underlying connections contribute greatly to the thematic development of the mythos.

As we explore the influences of the arcane symbols on the myth's intricacies, we discover that understanding these symbols allows the orators to gain control over certain aspects of the celestial realm. This command of symbology ultimately empowers the mortal characters, who can use the marks to deepen their connection to the astral entities and shape their own destinies.

In conclusion, the interplay of orally-transmitted spellcraft and lore within the legendary mythos of Astarania creates a rich tapestry of narrative progression and thematic development. The relationships between the astral entities and the orators of the occult, as well as the significance of the esoteric symbology, provide a multi-layered story that invites analysis and interpretation. This mythos reminds us of the deep connection between our reality and the celestial plane, the transformative power of ancient symbols, and the potential of mortals to shape their own fate through a mastery of the occult.
