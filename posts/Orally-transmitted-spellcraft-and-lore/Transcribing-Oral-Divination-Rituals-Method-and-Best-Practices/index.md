**Step 3**: Detailed Step-by-Step Transcription
Using the information gathered during the analysis, create a detailed, written guide to the divination ritual. Include step-by-step instructions, descriptions of the sequence, and explanations for each symbol and incantation used. Ensure that the transcription is clear, accurate, and faithful to the oral tradition.
**Step 4**: Theoretical Foundations and Broader Context
In addition to the transcription, provide a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical foundations underpinning the oral tradition. Discuss the history, development, and purpose of the divination ritual, as well as how it fits within the broader context of occult knowledge.

After completing the transcription and analysis, review the document for accuracy and clarity. Consult with practitioners of the divination ritual and experts in the field of occult studies to ensure the validity of the transcription. Revise the document as necessary based on feedback.
