  Answer:
  
  To properly address this knowledge challenge, let us begin by breaking it down into its constituent components. We will first provide an overview of Gaumata and the central tenets of his teachings. Following that, we will discuss the significance of spiritual awakening and its relationship to materialism. Finally, we will explore how esotericism, occult symbolism, and the life of Gaumata come together to influence an initiate's journey towards transcendent knowledge. 
  
  Overview of Gaumata:
  
  Gaumata, also known as Gaumata the Magian or pseudo-Smerdis, was a historical figure in ancient Persian history who successfully seized the throne of the Achaemenid Empire from Cambyses II. Although not much information is available on the life and teachings of Gaumata, he is thought to have been a practitioner of the Zoroastrian faith and a member of the Magi, known for their practice of the esoteric arts, astrology, and spiritual insights.
  
  Spiritual Awakening and Materialism:
  
  In the context of Gaumata's teachings and practice, spiritual awakening represents the expansion of human consciousness and awareness beyond the physical and mundane realms. This expanded awareness encompasses a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things, as well as a profound sense of inner peace, compassionate love, and connectedness with the divine.
  
  On the other hand, materialism refers to the attachment and valuation of worldly possessions, achievements, and social status. In the process of spiritual awakening, one would be expected to detach from these material concerns and focus on the pursuit of transcendent knowledge and inner fulfillment.
  
  Esotericism, Occult Symbolism, and Gaumata's Life:
  
  Gaumata's life and teachings exhibit strong connections to both esotericism and occult symbolism. As a Magian, he would have been familiar with and well-versed in mystical and esoteric principles, which can be considered a critical aspect of his spiritual awakening.
  
  Occult symbolism often serves as a conduit for communication between the mundane and divine realms, enabling the seeker to tap into hidden knowledge and higher truth. The symbols and rituals employed in occult practices serve to activate the individual's latent spiritual energies and facilitate a connection with the divine.
  
  The duality between spiritual awakening and materialism is a recurring theme in esoteric and occult traditions, including those practiced by Gaumata. Often, the journey towards spiritual awakening and transcendent knowledge involves a conscious choice to shed attachment to material possessions and mundane concerns in favor of a deeper connection to divine wisdom.
  
  Initiate's Journey towards Transcendent Knowledge:
  
  In the context of Gaumata's teachings, spiritual awakening and materialism serve as two opposing forces that must be navigated and balanced as an initiate seeks transcendent knowledge.
  
  An initiate must first recognize and embrace the significance of spiritual awakening while rejecting the pull of materialism. By understanding the limitations of a material-driven existence and recognizing the potential of a spiritually awakened consciousness, the initiate can then embark on the journey towards higher wisdom and deeper insights.
  
  Throughout this journey, the initiate may utilize esotericism and occult symbolism as tools to facilitate the process of spiritual growth. By engaging with these symbols and practices, the individual can unlock hidden knowledge and make conscious connections with the divine source of wisdom.
  
  Conclusion:
  
  In the context of Gaumata's teachings, the duality of spiritual awakening and materialism serves as a critical factor in the pursuit of transcendent knowledge. By embracing the significance of spiritual awakening and letting go of material attachments, an initiate can transcend their mundane existence and embark on a journey towards higher wisdom. By incorporating esotericism and occult symbolism into their spiritual practice, they can further facilitate their connection with the divine, ultimately leading to an enriched understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the divine mysteries of existence.
