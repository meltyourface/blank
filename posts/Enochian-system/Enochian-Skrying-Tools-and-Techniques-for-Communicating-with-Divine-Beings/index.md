Enochian Skrying: Origins, Tools, and Techniques

### I. Origins of the Enochian System

The Enochian system of magic dates back to the late 16th century, with its primary source attributed to the work of British polymath, mathematician, and occultist Dr. John Dee and his psychic associate, Edward Kelley. Dee, inspired by the book of Enoch in Biblical Apocrypha, sought to communicate with divine beings and retrieve a "Celestial Language." Edward Kelley, purportedly a skilled scryer, played a pivotal role in contacting the spirits, which ultimately dictated the Enochian system to Dee through him.

### II. Essential Enochian Tools

For practitioners of the Enochian system, several vital tools are integral to successful skrying, including the Holy Table, the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, and the Enochian alphabet.

1. The Holy Table: A wooden table inscribed with Enochian characters, divine names, and symbols. The Holy Table serves as the foundation for Enochian skrying, connecting the practitioner to celestial and elemental forces.

2. The Sigillum Dei Aemeth: A consecrated wax seal, also featuring Enochian characters and symbols. The Sigillum Dei Aemeth, translated as the "seal of God's truth", is placed upon the Holy Table and serves to protect the scryer and strengthen their connection with the Enochian beings.

3. The Enochian Alphabet: The Enochian script is central to Enochian magic and is essential for transmitting the celestial language. Each character corresponds to a specific sound and acts as a tool for decoding messages received during skrying sessions.

### III. Consecration of Enochian Tools

Before delving into Enochian skrying, it is crucial to consecrate the tools involved. Some recommended methods of consecrating Enochian tools include:

1. Cleansing: Cleanse the tools physically and then spiritually, utilizing methods such as smudging with sage or using consecrated water.

2. Inscribing: Properly inscribe the Enochian symbols and characters onto the Holy Table and Sigillum Dei Aemeth according to the traditional sources, such as Dee's records.

3. Charging: Energize the tools using focused meditation, prayer, or invoking the presence of appropriate Enochian entities to bless and empower the items.

### IV. Performing Enochian Skrying

To perform Enochian skrying, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the space: Set up a designated and undisturbed location, preferably with dim lighting, to create a conducive environment for skrying.

2. Enter a visionary state: Utilize meditation, breathing exercises, or repetitive chanting of Enochian invocations to achieve the desired mental state for skrying.

3. Establish contact: Call upon Enochian entities and guides, requesting their presence, protection, and assistance in the skrying session. Seek permission and establish a link with the beings you wish to communicate with.

4. Engage in skrying: Focus on your chosen medium (such as a crystal ball, mirror, or bowl of water) and allow the Enochian beings to communicate with you through visions and insights.

5. Record your experience: Keep a detailed account of the messages received, including symbols, words, and images. Over time, this record will serve as a valuable tool for understanding the Enochian language and decoding the messages.

6. Confirmation and interpretation: Seek guidance from the Enochian entities and your intuition in interpreting the messages. Cross-reference your findings with traditional Enochian sources for additional clarity.

### V. Efficacy and Role in Modern Occult Practices

Many practitioners assert that Enochian skrying offers profound spiritual experiences and direct communication with divine entities. Critics, however, argue that it is a product of Dee and Kelley's imaginations, rather than genuinely supernatural. The Enochian system continues to hold a prominent position within Western occultism, and its impact has resonated through various contemporary magical practices, including Thelema, the Golden Dawn, and Chaos Magick.

Overall, Enochian skrying remains a fascinating aspect of the Western esoteric tradition. Its roots, tools, and techniques offer dedicated practitioners a unique and potent gateway to spiritual exploration and the possibility of accessing the divine.
