## Enochian System of Magic - A Comprehensive Overview

### I. Historical Background

The Enochian system of magic, also known as the language of the angels, is an esoteric and occult practice that traces its origins back to the work of Dr. John Dee (1527–1609) and his assistant, Edward Kelley (1555–1597). As prominent figures in the Elizabethan age, Dee and Kelley claimed to have received this sacred knowledge through angelic communications during a series of spiritual scrying sessions in the late 16th century. This mysterious language was purportedly the key to unlocking powerful forces and secrets of the universe and was attributed to the mystical figure of Enoch, seventh patriarch from Adam in biblical tradition.

### II. Key Components and Fundamental Principles

The Enochian system consists of several key components, which will be further elaborated upon in the sections that follow: Enochian script, language, calls, and the Watchtowers of light. It is important to approach the study of the Enochian system with the intent of establishing a solid foundation, as the intricate nature of its principles requires a deep understanding and respect for the source material.

1. **Enochian Script and Language**

The Enochian script is composed of 21 unique characters based on a modified version of the Latin alphabet. While visually distinct, historical investigations suggest there may be subtle connections between Enochian script, Runic script, and other alphabetic systems. Each character of the Enochian script represents a phonetic sound that contributes to the beauty and complexity of the Enochian language.

Enochian language, also called the "Angelical Language," is considered to be a divine tongue, constituting a series of phrases, syntax, and grammar rules that deviate considerably from those of recognizable modern languages. The language is believed to carry inherent power in its words, pronouncing them invokes specific magical effects. Studying and mastering the Enochian language and script requires dedication and discipline, as mispronunciation or improper use may lead to unintended or hazardous consequences.

2. **Enochian Calls**

Enochian calls are the verses or invocations that form the basis of Enochian magic rituals. These calls are recited in the Enochian language and serve as the keys to unlocking the deeper mysteries encapsulated within Enochian practice. There are 19 calls in total, with the first 18 focusing on the elemental energies of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, as well as specific celestial and angelic forces. The 19th call is reserved for opening the Aethyrs or the supreme worlds.

### III. Enochian Practice for the Modern Occultist

The study of Enochian magic can significantly enhance an occult practitioner's spiritual journey through increased awareness of the divine and the esoteric forces surrounding our existence. Below are several steps to begin incorporating Enochian magic into one's practice:

1. Foundational Studies: Begin by studying the foundational works of Dr. John Dee, specifically "The Five Books of Mystery" (also known as the "Mysteriorum Libri Quinque") and the "True and Faithful Relation." Familiarize yourself with the Enochian script and language through regular practice and study.

2. Personal Meditations: Meditate on the Enochian calls and their meanings as you progress through your studies. This helps to internalize the knowledge and deepen your connection to the Enochian system.

3. Magical Implements: Create or obtain magical tools specific to the Enochian tradition, such as the Sigillum Dei Aemeth (the Seal of God's Truth) and the elemental Tablets of Union.

4. Pathworking: Engage in pathworking—guided visualizations and contemplative exercises—based on the Enochian system to solidify your understanding of the complex realms within the Enochian cosmology.

5. Practical Application: Gradually incorporate Enochian rituals and magical workings into your existing practice once you have developed a strong foundation in the Enochian system.

As with any esoteric pursuit, the journey toward mastery is continuous and requires deep commitment, practice, and introspection. By approaching the Enochian system of magic with an open mind and sincere dedication, the occult practitioner will unlock doors to profound revelations and spiritual growth.
