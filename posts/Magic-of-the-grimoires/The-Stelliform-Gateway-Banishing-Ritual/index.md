## The Banishing Rite of the Stelliform Gateway

Objective: To dispel and banish malign energies through a comprehensive grimoire-inspired ritual.

Materials Required:

1. Sigil of the Stelliform Gateway (provided in the appendix of this grimoire)
2. Altar cloth (preferably white or purple)
3. Ritual dagger / athame
4. Ceremonial chalice filled with water
5. Incense (preferably frankincense or sage)
6. **Herbs**: Bundle of sage, pinch of salt, and rosemary sprigs
7. **Crystals**: Black tourmaline, selenite, and clear quartz
8. White or purple candles (one central and four smaller ones)
9. Compass
10. A metronome or similar device for maintaining rhythm

Ritual Setup:

1. Align the altar to the cardinal directions using the compass. Place the white or purple altar cloth upon it.

2. **Arrange the ritual items on the altar in the following order**:

   a. The central candle at the center of the altar.
   b. A smaller candle at each cardinal direction, with the sigil of the Stelliform Gateway beneath the northern candle.
   c. The ritual dagger to the east.
   d. The chalice with water to the west.
   e. The incense and herbs to the south.
   f. The crystals to the north.

3. Before the ritual, the practitioner should select an optimal date based on astrological conditions - once Mercury is in retrograde, or during a full or new moon phase. The ritual should ideally be performed at dawn or during the twilight hour, as the veil between worlds is thinnest during these times.

Preliminary Consecration and Purification:

1. Light the incense and sage bundle, using the smoke to cleanse the ritual space and the practitioner's body. Sprinkle a pinch of salt upon the chalice water to further purify it. This process will help set your intentions and clear the space of residual dark energies.

2. Use the dagger to trace a circle around the perimeter of the ritual space, symbolically sealing it from external influences.

Ritual Procedure:

1. Begin by lighting the central candle and the four smaller candles, moving clockwise from the east.

2. Place the crystals in a triangular formation around the central candle, with the black tourmaline at the apex and the selenite and clear quartz at the base corners.

3. Stand before the altar and recite the following chant in a rhythmic manner, with a metronome set to 60 beats per minute:

   "Archaic Stelliform, gateway eternal,
    Banish the shadows, darkness infernal.
    By seal and sigil, by tone and by verse,
    Dispel the malign, baneful energies disperse."

4. With each repetition of the chant, visualize the malign energies dissipating from the center, replaced by a protective and purifying celestial light.

5. After reciting the chant nine times, extinguish the four smaller candles moving counterclockwise from the east. **Close the rite by raising your arms and proclaiming**:

   "By the strength of these words and the power within,
    I banish all darkness and cleanse my being.
    Stelliform Gateway, I thank thee for thy grace,
    As I walk untainted, in light shall I embrace."

Post-Ritual Purification and Consecration:

1. Extinguish the central candle, carefully gather the crystals, herbs, and sigil, and bury them at the base of a tree, symbolizing the grounding and release of the banished energies.

2. Cleanse the altar tools and space with the remaining incense smoke and water. This will ensure that any residual dark energies are fully dispelled.

Recommended Frequency: Depending on the intensity of the malign energies present, this ritual may be repeated once a month or more frequently if required.
