Day 1 - New Moon Ritual

Begin in a dimly lit room or your preferred ritual space. Ensure your surroundings are cleansed and charged for the work at hand.

0. Grounding and Centering:
Take several deep breaths, focusing on the flow of air entering and leaving your lungs. Draw your consciousness into your root chakra, grounding any discordant energies into the Earth below. Center yourself within your body and feel your energy field expanding with each breath.

1. Invocation of Elemental Guardians:
Facing East, call upon the elemental Guardian of Air: "Raziel, Guardian of the East, I call upon your wisdom to inform my path of transformation and growth. Lend me your sight, that I might perceive the subtle energies surrounding my being."

Turning to the South, invoke the Guardian of Fire: "Mikhael, Guardian of the South, infuse thy molten flame with my desires that I might form a crucible of change within the realm of the flesh."

Proceed Westward and invoke the Guardian of Water: "Gabriel, Custodian of the Western Waters, cleanse and pour forth thy depths into my consciousness that I may integrate the myriad forms of my experience."

Finally, move to face the North and call upon the Guardian of Earth: "Uriel, Mighty Pillar of the North, let your roots entwine my spirit, anchoring me to the mysteries of matter and guiding my manifestation upon this plane."

2. Invocation of the Niantielian Spirits:

With your gaze turned upward, chant: "Zaier, Laima, and Melus, emissaries of the Niantielian realms, I invoke you to strengthen my connection to the Great Arcanum. Guide me to fathom its secrets and manifest the power within."

3. Astral Projection Technique:

Sit or lie down comfortably and begin to visualize your astral body as a luminous construct separate from your physical form. Focus on keeping your breath deep and steady, letting your physical sensations fade into the background. Once fully immersed in your astral self, set your intention to travel to the Niantielian realm.

Envision a swirling vortex of energy before you, drawing you closer as you approach. Allow yourself to be pulled through this gateway, immersing yourself within the realm of the Niantielian spirits.

4. Alignment with Occult Powers:

Spend time in the presence of Zaier, Laima, and Melus, receiving insights and guidance on your path. Embody their wisdom and ask them to bless your ritual practice with the attunement necessary to foster an ever-deepening connection to the occult powers that guide your work.

5. Return and Closing:

Thank the Niantielian spirits and begin your journey back to your physical body. As you merge with your body, absorb the knowledge and power you have acquired back into your physical form.

Turn to each of the elemental guardians in turn, thanking them for their presence and releasing them from their duties. Once all have been acknowledged, close the ritual by grounding and centering for a final time, integrating the energies of your astral and physical selves.

Repeat this ritual daily, modifying the invocation of the Niantielian spirits for each phase of the lunar cycle (waxing, full, waning) and aligning the invocation with the astrological sign of the Moon. This ensures that the practice evolves, deepening its connection to your personal work and adapting to different energetic currents within the cosmos.

By engaging in this ever-evolving pathworking practice, expect a journey of dynamic growth, expansive esoteric knowledge, and deepened connection to the Niantielian spirits and their occult powers.
