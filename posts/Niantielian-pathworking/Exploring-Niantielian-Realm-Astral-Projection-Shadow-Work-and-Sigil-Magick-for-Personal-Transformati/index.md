In answering this knowledge challenge, we will embark on a deep exploration of how the principles of astral projection, shadow work, and sigil magick come together to help one traverse the Niantielian realm, maintain conscious awareness, and ultimately, integrate the knowledge gained to facilitate personal transformation. We will delve into the historical and contextual background of these principles, understand their key tenets, and finally, demonstrate the synthesis of these principles using an example scenario.

**Astral Projection**

Astral projection refers to the intentional act of inducing an out-of-body experience (OBE) wherein the practitioner's consciousness, or an 'astral body,' temporarily separates from the physical body and gains the capability to traverse non-physical planes of existence. Throughout history and across different cultures, astral projection has been practiced for various purposes including spiritual growth, gaining knowledge, and healing.

To maintain conscious awareness during astral projection, practitioners often use a combination of relaxation techniques, meditation, and visualization exercises. These methods help to quiet the conscious mind, attain a trance-like state, and allow the astral body to detach and explore the Niantielian realm or other planes of consciousness.

**Shadow Work**

Shadow work is a psychological process of uncovering, acknowledging, and integrating the repressed, hidden, or darker aspects of oneself. Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology, described the 'shadow' as the unknown, unconscious part of our psyche that we often deny and project onto others.

Incorporating shadow work into traversing the Niantielian realm allows practitioners to confront their fears, limiting beliefs, and unresolved issues, leading to personal transformation and psychological integration. By engaging with these darker aspects of the self, individuals can heal past wounds, dissolve ingrained patterns, and uncover latent abilities, ultimately attaining a more authentic and liberated state of being.

**Sigil Magick**

Sigil magick involves the creation and activation of symbols that represent a specific intent, desire, or concept. These sigils, when charged with the practitioner's energy and will, are believed to effect change in the physical or astral plane. This form of chaos magick is particularly effective because it bypasses the conscious mind's criticisms and disbelief and allows the practitioner's intent to manifest through subconscious influence.

To incorporate sigil magick in the Niantielian pathworking, the practitioner can create sigils to enhance their abilities during astral projection, facilitate successful shadow work, and reinforce their focus while traversing non-physical realms.

**Synthesis and Scenario**

Imagine you are a seeker who wants to embark on the Niantielian realm to gain insights into your personal transformation. First, you engage in astral projection by relaxing your body, quieting your mind, and visualizing the desired plane you wish to explore. Once your consciousness has shifted, you enter the Niantielian realm with the intent of confronting and embracing your shadow aspects.

Prior to your journey, you created a sigil representing fearlessness, acceptance, and inner transformation. By holding this sigil in your astral awareness, you ensure that your subconscious mind is primed to support your shadow work. As you traverse the Niantielian realm, you encounter manifestations of your repressed fears, desires, and traumas.

Using the power of sigil magick infused with the intentions of fearlessness, acceptance, and transformation, you face each shadow aspect, acknowledging their presence, lessons, and the role they play in your life. As you integrate these shadow aspects, you experience a profound sense of liberation and wholeness.

Throughout this journey, your conscious awareness remains intact, allowing you to bring back vital insights and lessons that contribute to your personal growth and transformation once you return to your physical body.

**Conclusion**

In traversing the Niantielian realm and synthesizing the principles of astral projection, shadow work, and sigil magick, we have revealed their interdependence, transformative potential, and powerful effects. By attempting astral projection, we can explore non-physical realms with conscious awareness. Through shadow work, we are able to confront, acknowledge, and integrate previously repressed aspects of our psyche, resulting in psychological integration and healing. Lastly, sigil magick reinforces our intentions, ensuring that our journey is purposeful and focused.

Such experiences not only facilitate personal transformation but also grant profound insights into the mysteries of the self and the universe.
