The Theosophical Society, founded in 1875, was an organization that played a significant role in shaping the esoteric and occult practices in modern times. Many key female figures within the organization contributed to its growth and development. They held leadership positions within the society and were active in various aspects, such as education, advocacy, and publishing.

Some of the noteworthy female figures in the Theosophical Society include:

1. **Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891)**: Helena Blavatsky, a Russian author and the co-founder of the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in promoting theosophical ideas to the West. Her published works, such as "Isis Unveiled" (1877) and "The Secret Doctrine" (1888), combined Eastern and Western esoteric traditions providing a framework for modern occultism. She brought together diverse occult practices, paving the way for new understandings of esoteric knowledge.

2. **Annie Besant (1847-1933)**: Annie Besant, a British social reformer, and Theosophist, took over the leadership of the society after Blavatsky's death. She played a crucial role in the organization's growth and expansion. As an influential speaker, she attracted many followers to the Theosophical Society. Besant authored numerous books, articles, and pamphlets on Theosophy, education, and social issues, further spreading Theosophical ideals. She was also a prominent advocate of women's rights, Indian self-rule, and education reform.

3. **Katherine Tingley (1847-1929)**: As another key figure in the Theosophical Society, Katherine Tingley established the International Theosophical Headquarters in Point Loma, California. The headquarters, known as Lomaland, served as a prominent center for theosophical education, performing arts, and community living. Tingley devoted her life to promoting universal brotherhood, peace, and spiritual enlightenment. She also founded the Raja Yoga School, which combined eastern and western educational methods.

The feminine divine in Theosophy played a significant role in shaping art, literature, and culture. Blavatsky's ideas regarding the divine feminine, specifically her assertion that the ancient wisdom traditions revered a female deity, paved the way for the revival of goddess worship. This revival permeated across various artistic domains, leading to the creation of works that celebrated feminine divinity. The influence of feminine divine imagery can also be seen in the modernist art movements alongside the burgeoning spiritualism and esotericism of the early 20th century.

Furthermore, the connection between the Theosophical Society and other women-led occult circles is a testament to the significance of female occult practitioners. Blavatsky's influence extended to other prominent female esotericists, such as Moina Mathers (co-founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) and Dion Fortune (founder of the Society of the Inner Light). These women-led organizations shared mutual interests and ideas, resulting in a cross-pollination of occult and esoteric knowledge.

In conclusion, the contributions and impact of women in the Theosophical Society are far-reaching. Not only did these women hold essential positions within the organization, but they also actively influenced the development of theosophical ideologies and their dissemination through their publications and teachings. The resurgence of the feminine divine in Theosophy significantly impacted art, literature, and culture, while also connecting with other female-led occult circles.
