**Explanation**:
The A.A. (Astrum Argenteum or Silver Star) and O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of the Eastern Temple) are two distinct occult fraternities founded by Aleister Crowley, with different focuses and objectives for their members.

The A.A. is primarily centered on personal illumination and spiritual growth. The fraternity is organized as a hierarchical structure, but its main purpose is to guide individual members through a series of initiations that lead them on a path of self-discovery. This journey is rooted in the philosophy and practices of Thelema, a spiritual path also developed by Crowley. Thelema teaches that individuals must discover and follow their True Will, which is their innermost nature and sole purpose in life. Thus, the A.A. aims to help members realize their True Will and develop their spiritual selves through various esoteric practices such as meditation, astral projection, and the study of mystical texts.

On the other hand, the O.T.O. is focused on communal rituals and the advancement within the hierarchy of the order. While the O.T.O. also adheres to the principles of Thelema, it places a greater emphasis on the social, organizational, and ceremonial aspects of the tradition. The O.T.O. conducts group rituals, such as the Gnostic Mass, to focus energy and create a sense of community among its members. As members progress through the degrees of the order, they gain access to more advanced teachings and responsibilities. This advancement within the hierarchy is a significant part of the O.T.O. experience, as it not only grants greater knowledge but also fosters a sense of accomplishment and connection within the order's structure.

In summary, the A.A. focuses primarily on fostering personal illumination and spiritual growth in its members, while the O.T.O. emphasizes communal rituals and hierarchical advancement within the order. Both fraternities share their foundation in the principles of Thelema but have distinct approaches to achieving their respective objectives.
