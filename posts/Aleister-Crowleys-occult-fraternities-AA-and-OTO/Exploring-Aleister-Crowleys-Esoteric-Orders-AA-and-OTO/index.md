## Aleister Crowley's Occult Fraternities: An Overview of A.'.A.'. and O.T.O.

Introduction

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), an English occultist, poet, and writer, founded and led two prominent esoteric organizations: the Astrum Argentum (A.'.A.'.) and the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Both fraternities played significant roles in the development and dissemination of occult knowledge and practices in the early 20th century. This section provides an in-depth look at the origins, key beliefs, practices, and structures of these organizations, equipping students with comprehensive information to better understand their significance within the esoteric tradition.

1. Astrum Argentum (A.'.A.'.)

### 1.1 Origins

A.'.A.'. (Astrum Argentum, or Silver Star) was formed by Aleister Crowley and George Cecil Jones in 1907. It emerged as a direct successor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a prominent esoteric society in which Crowley and Jones held membership. The A.'.A.'. was established to continue the Golden Dawn's lineage and work, emphasizing spiritual advancement and the attainment of Gnosis or higher knowledge.

### 1.2 Key Beliefs

The fundamental belief of the A.'.A.'. is the attainment of spiritual enlightenment through individual effort and inner transformation. The system draws on various occult, mystical, and magical practices, integrating Qabalah, Hermeticism, Eastern and Western mysticism, and ceremonial magick. Central to these teachings is Crowley's Thelemic philosophy, which holds that each individual should discover and pursue their True Will, a unique, divinely ordained path in life.

### 1.3 Practices

The A.'.A.'. trains its adherents through a rigorous system of grades, adhering to a structured curriculum of study, meditation, magical practice, and moral discipline. Members progress through a series of initiatory ceremonies, which serve to confer spiritual power and align the individual with their True Will. Practices include yoga, ritual magick, divination, and astral projection, all geared towards achieving deeper levels of self-awareness and spiritual insight.

### 1.4 Structure

The A.'.A.'. is organized into three orders or triads. The first order consists of the grades of the "Golden Dawn"; the second order of the "Rosy Cross"; and the third order, called the "Silver Star," represents the highest level of spiritual attainment. Each grade in this structure corresponds to a specific sephirah on the Qabalistic Tree of Life, reflecting a progressive journey towards union with the Divine.

2. Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)

### 2.1 Origins

Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) was founded in the early 1900s by Carl Kellner, a German industrialist, and Theodor Reuss, a journalist and occultist. The order was initially intended as a Masonic-like organization with a strong interest in esotericism. In 1912, Crowley joined the O.T.O., and by 1925, he became its Outer Head of the Order, incorporating his Thelemic philosophies into the order's structure and practices.

### 2.2 Key Beliefs

O.T.O.'s core principles are rooted in Thelema, emphasizing the discovery and execution of the individual's True Will. Members are encouraged to seek and conquer their inner selves to align with their personal spiritual destinies. The order also places great importance on the rituals and teachings of the Gnostic Mass, a ceremonial rite that celebrates the principles of Thelema and explores the mysteries of life, death, and spiritual transformation.

### 2.3 Practices

The O.T.O. employs a degree-based system, combining elements of Freemasonry, Thelema, and Hermetic philosophy. Degrees are awarded through a series of initiatory rituals, aiming to confer occult knowledge and self-mastery. Activities within the order include group rituals, lectures, study groups, and performances of the Gnostic Mass, all working in tandem to provide a fertile ground for personal and collective spiritual growth.

### 2.4 Structure

The O.T.O. is structured through a hierarchical system of degrees, divided into three main categories: the Man of Earth, the Lover, and the Hermit. These degrees are further subdivided into smaller grades, each with specific teachings and initiation rituals. This system is designed to reflect the stages of personal development and spiritual progression, guiding members on their quest for self-discovery and transformation.

Conclusion

Both the A.'.A.'. and the O.T.O. encompass important aspects of Aleister Crowley's esoteric legacy, offering unique yet complementary approaches to spiritual development and Thelemic philosophy. These organizations have had a lasting impact on the landscape of modern occultism, and their teachings continue to provide seekers with valuable insights and tools for personal transformation. Engaging with these fraternities can be an enriching journey of self-exploration, illuminating the depths of the human spirit and our place in the universe.
