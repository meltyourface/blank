description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Aleister Crowley's occult fraternities
  (A.'.A.'. and O.T.O.), you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: >
  1. A specific set of Thelemic rituals such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, Star Ruby, and the Gnostic Mass, which will be performed at designated times to align with the practitioner's schedule, aim, and level of proficiency.
  
  2. Individualized meditation practices integrating Thelemic principles, such as Visualization of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, Rising on the Planes, and the Middle Pillar Exercise. These meditations should be selected and adapted to the individual's spiritual goals and psychic development.
  
  3. A carefully curated reading list encompassing key texts from Aleister Crowley's vast literary works, such as The Book of the Law, Magick in Theory and Practice, and The Equinox. The selection should also include writings from other authors, like Frater Achad and Israel Regardie, to facilitate a diverse understanding of Thelemic philosophy.
  
  4. The incorporation of personalized methods for maintaining a magical diary, documenting one's journey, observations, and insights as they explore the teachings of Crowley's A.'.A.'. and O.T.O. systems.

To create a comprehensive daily Thelemic practice focused on the A.'.A.'. and O.T.O. teachings, I have designed a practical regimen that caters to the practitioner's personal spiritual requirements and goals. This tailored regimen is organized into four main categories: rituals, meditation, reading, and magical diary.

1. Thelemic Rituals:

For a balanced practice, the following rituals can be performed at designated times according to the practitioner's schedule, aim, and level of proficiency. Adapt the performance of these rituals based on the individual's needs and progress.

- Morning: Resh (invocation of the sun) and performance of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram or Star Ruby
- Afternoon: Resh and a reading of selected passages from the Holy Books of Thelema (e.g., Liber LXV and Liber VII)
- Evening: Resh, performance of the Middle Pillar Exercise (vibrating the divine names), and individual work with the Gnostic Mass (study or attend the public celebration)
- Night: Resh and a performance of the Star Ruby or the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram

2. Meditation Practices:

To cultivate focus, spiritual growth, and psychic development, incorporate the following meditation practices into your daily regimen. These techniques should be tailored to the practitioner's spiritual goals and current level of experience.

- Morning: Visualization of the Qabalistic Tree of Life (Sephiroth meditation), with a focus on the practitioner's primary sphere of interest or work
- Midday: Brief visualization exercises to maintain the connection to one's Higher Self and the flow of energy throughout the day
- Evening: Rising on the Planes meditation, to explore higher states of consciousness, develop astral travel, and commune with the divine

3. Reading List:

For a well-rounded understanding of Thelema's philosophy and practices, the following key texts should be studied regularly. Include additional works from Crowley, as well as Frater Achad, Israel Regardie, and other related authors, to enrich the practitioner's knowledge base.

- The Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis)
- Magick in Theory and Practice
- The Equinox
- The Vision and the Voice (Liber 418)
- The Confessions of Aleister Crowley
- Book 4 (Liber ABA)
- Recommended books by Frater Achad:
  - Q.B.L. or The Bride's Reception
  - The Tree of Life: A Study in Magic
- Recommended books by Israel Regardie:
  - The Golden Dawn
  - The Art of True Healing: A Treatise on the Mechanism of Prayer and the Operation of the Law of Attraction in Nature

4. Magical Diary:

Maintaining a magical diary is essential for documenting one's journey, reflections, and insights. Consider incorporating the following aspects to capture an accurate and holistic record of your progress:

- Daily ritual performance, including impressions, experiences, and any significant encounters
- Meditation practices, psychic insights, and personal discoveries
- Key teachings and interpretations of the reading material, along with any synchronicities, dreams, or patterns of interest
- Personal reflections on the practitioner's True Will and the unfolding of their Great Work

The daily practice I have outlined here aims to be comprehensive, adaptable, and continuously evolving to support the practitioner in achieving their Great Work and aligning with their True Will. By adjusting each of the four components as needed, a personalized Thelemic practice will emerge, based on the rich teachings of Aleister Crowley's occult fraternities (A.'.A.'. and O.T.O.).
