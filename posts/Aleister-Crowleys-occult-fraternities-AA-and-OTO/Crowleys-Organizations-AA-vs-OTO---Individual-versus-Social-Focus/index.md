- A.'.A.'. primarily focused on individual spiritual attainment through practices like Yoga and Magick while O.T.O. emphasized group ceremonial rituals and promoted the accomplishment of a New Aeon society

The A.'.A.'. (Astrum Argenteum or Silver Star) and the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of Oriental Templars) are two separate occult organizations founded or restructured by Aleister Crowley. While both organizations share some similarities, they serve different purposes and have distinct objectives.

The A.'.A.'. is an occult fraternity that focuses on individual spiritual development and attainment. It follows a structured system of teachings, practices, and grades that guide its members on the path to self-realization and mastery over their personal magick. The A.'.A.'. curriculum includes practices originating from Hinduism and Buddhism such as Yoga, as well as esoteric disciplines like Qabalah and Tarot. The ultimate aim of the A.'.A.'. is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and the crossing of the Abyss, which leads to spiritual enlightenment and union with the Divine.

On the other hand, the O.T.O. is a more socially oriented organization that revolves around group ceremonial rituals and promoting the Law of Thelema. Thelema is a philosophy and religious movement originally introduced by Crowley, centered around the maxim "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." The O.T.O. focuses on the realization of a New Aeon society that operates under this principle, fostering individualism and celebrating human aspirations.

While both A.'.A.'. and O.T.O. facilitate the practice of Magick and the pursuit of personal transformation, their primary objectives and methods differ. The A.'.A.'. emphasizes individual spiritual attainment and self-discovery, while the O.T.O. engages in group rituals and seeks to manifest a society in alignment with Thelemic principles. In summary, the A.'.A.'.’s main goal is to guide its members towards personal enlightenment and spiritual mastery, whereas the O.T.O.’s central aim is to create a societal framework that embraces and promotes the Law of Thelema.
