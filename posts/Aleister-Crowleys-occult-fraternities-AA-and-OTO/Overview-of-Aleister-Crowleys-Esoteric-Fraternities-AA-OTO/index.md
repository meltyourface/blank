## Aleister Crowley's Occult Fraternities: A∴A∴ and O.T.O.

Introduction

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was an influential figure in modern occultism, establishing two prominent fraternities: the A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum or Silver Star) and the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of the Eastern Temple). Delving into the structure, initiation processes, and teachings of these organizations offers a profound understanding of Crowley's contributions to the esoteric tradition.

A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum)

Purpose

Founded in 1907 by Crowley and George Cecil Jones, the A∴A∴ is a spiritual organization dedicated to guiding individuals towards self-realization and the embodiment of their True Will. Drawing from the Western esoteric tradition, the A∴A∴ incorporates elements of Hermeticism, Kabbalah, ceremonial magick, and Yoga, providing a rigorous system of study and practice for attainment.

Organizational Structure

The A∴A∴ divides its hierarchical structure into three Orders:

1. The Golden Dawn (Outer Order): Consists of neophytes working through progressive grades, aiming to acquire a solid foundation in magick and mysticism.
2. The R.R. et A.C. (Inner Order): Reserved for adepts who achieved adeptus minor (5=6) and beyond, focusing on more advanced magickal practices.
3. The Silver Star (Third Order): Comprised of advanced masters who guide and direct the entire organization.

Initiation Process

The A∴A∴'s initiatory path is composed of a series of grades, each representing a specific stage of spiritual advancement. Prospective initiates must complete a probationary period, following which they take a series of examinations and oaths, demonstrating proficiency in their magickal development.

Core Teachings

Two primary texts outline the A∴A∴ curriculum: "Liber AL vel Legis" (The Book of the Law) which serves as a foundational philosophical text and "Liber ABA" (Book Four) which contains practical instructions on meditation, ceremonial magick, and Yoga. Crowley's "Liber 777" serves as a comprehensive guide to the correspondences within the Western esoteric tradition.

Practices

A∴A∴ members regularly engage in practices such as ceremonial magick, invocation and evocation of deities, astral travel, and meditation, including the practice of Raja Yoga and mindfulness. They are also expected to maintain a magickal diary as a record of their progress.

O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis)

Purpose

Crowley became the head of the O.T.O. in 1922, adapting the existing Masonic-like organization into a system of spiritual and personal development, incorporating Thelemic principles. The O.T.O. aims to establish a theocratic New Aeon, a post-Christian era governed by the Law of Thelema.

Organizational Structure

The O.T.O. employs a hierarchical structure consisting of three triads:

1. Man of Earth (degrees 0°-III°): Focused on individual self-discovery and personal development.
2. Lover (degrees IV°-PI): Concerned with alchemical transformation and establishing fraternal relations with fellow members.
3. Hermit (degrees K.E.W. and above): Dedicated to leading the O.T.O. by implementing Thelemic governance and sharing spiritual wisdom.

Initiation Process

Prospective members undergo a series of initiations, each involving a ritualized ceremony symbolizing the passage through different stages of spiritual and personal growth. The initiation rites, designed to accentuate essential landmarks in the individual's progress, employ allegorical methods and Masonic symbolism.

Core Teachings

The O.T.O. is rooted in Thelema, an occult philosophical tradition established by Crowley upon receiving "Liber AL vel Legis." Its central tenet is "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," which emphasizes the importance of following one's True Will, the inherent purpose of an individual's existence.

Practices

Members of the O.T.O. regularly participate in the Gnostic Mass, a ritual that encapsulates the core beliefs of Thelema, often held in temples or privately among initiates. They also engage in practices like Sex Magick, leveraging sexual energy to achieve magickal objectives.

Conclusion

The A∴A∴ and O.T.O. remain vital systems within the modern esoteric landscape, promoting self-realization, spiritual growth, and a profound understanding of the Western occult tradition. By studying their structures, initiation processes, and core teachings, one can gain deep insights into the magickal philosophies and practices introduced by Aleister Crowley.
