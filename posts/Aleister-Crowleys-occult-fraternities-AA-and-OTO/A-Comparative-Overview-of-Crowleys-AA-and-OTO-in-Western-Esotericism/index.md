  Compare and contrast the essential differences in the aims, initiatory structures, and magickal practices between Aleister Crowley's A.A. and O.T.O., considering their historical development, key figures, and their impact on the Western esoteric tradition.
---
To compare and contrast Aleister Crowley's A∴ A∴ (Astrum Argentum or Silver Star) and O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of the Eastern Temple), we must first understand each organization's aims, initiatory structures, magickal practices, historical development, key figures, and impact on the Western esoteric tradition.

### I. Aims

A∴ A∴:
The primary aim of the A∴ A∴ is the individual's spiritual advancement and mastery of Magick and Mysticism. This organization is designed for sincere aspirants who wish to pursue the Great Work - the process of attaining Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and eventually, the accomplishment of the mystical grade of Magister Templi, Magus, and Ipsissimus.

O.T.O.:
The main goal of the O.T.O. is to guide individuals towards spiritual illumination and self-mastery through a system that combines esoteric Freemasonry, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and the teachings of Crowley's Thelema. O.T.O. also seeks to establish a global theocratic society – a world governed by spiritual authority and harmonious relations – based on the Law of Thelema: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

### II. Initiatory Structures

A∴ A∴:
The A∴ A∴ utilizes a hierarchical structure of grades based on the Tree of Life from the Qabalah. The ten numbered grades correspond to the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, while the three "negative veils" – Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur – represent states of consciousness beyond individual attainment. The process of initiation essentially consists of one's progress in personal development, combined with guidance from a superior within the order.

O.T.O.:
The initiatory structure of the O.T.O. is similar to that of Freemasonry, with a system of degrees divided into three main categories: Man of Earth, Lover, and Hermit. Each category has its own set of degrees representing different stages of spiritual evolution. Initiatory advancement in the O.T.O. is granted through ritual initiation, the sharing of knowledge, and the successful completion of tasks relating to the individual's moral, intellectual, and spiritual development.

### III. Magickal Practices

A∴ A∴:
The magickal training within A∴ A∴ focuses on ceremonial magick, yoga, Qabalah, and various esoteric disciplines. Aspirants are taught to develop their own practices and disciplines that resonate with them personally, rather than adhering strictly to a set curriculum. The core teachings include the mastery of astral travel, the invocation of deities, the practice of divination, and the exploration of one's own inner self and True Will.

O.T.O.:
While the O.T.O. incorporates many of the magickal practices present in the A∴ A∴, the organization emphasizes the practice of sexual magick and the Gnostic Mass, the central ritual of the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (E.G.C.), the ecclesiastical arm of the O.T.O. The techniques of sexual magick are taught within the higher degrees and are regarded as the key to unlocking one's divine potential.

### IV. Historical Development, Key Figures, and Impact on the Western Esoteric Tradition

A∴ A∴:
Aleister Crowley founded the A∴ A∴ in 1907, after his disillusionment with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He sought to establish a new order that would provide comprehensive training in Magick and Mysticism. The historical development of the A∴ A∴ has been marked by various lineages and claims to authority, including the followers of Crowley, Israel Regardie, and Marcelo Ramos Motta. The impact of the A∴ A∴ on the Western esoteric tradition is significant, having influenced the writings and works of countless individuals in the fields of Magick, Mysticism, and Spirituality.

O.T.O.:
The O.T.O. was founded in the early 20th century by prominent German occultists Carl Kellner and Theodor Reuss as a synthesis of several esoteric currents. Aleister Crowley joined the O.T.O. in 1910 and quickly rose through the ranks, revising many of the order's rituals and incorporating the principles of his religion Thelema. Notable figures within the order's history include Karl Germer, Grady McMurtry, and major literary figures such as William S. Burroughs and Kenneth Grant. The O.T.O. has had a lasting impact on the Western esoteric tradition as a distinctive system incorporating Magick, Mysticism, and diverse spiritual practices.

In conclusion, the key differences between the A∴ A∴ and O.T.O. lie in their respective aims, initiatory structures, and magickal practices:

1. The A∴ A∴ focuses on the individual's spiritual advancement and the accomplishment of the Great Work, while the O.T.O. seeks to establish a global theocratic society based on the Law of Thelema.

2. The A∴ A∴ has a hierarchical structure based on the Qabalistic Tree of Life, with initiation centered around personal development and guidance from a superior. The O.T.O. uses a degree-based system similar to Freemasonry, granting initiation through rituals and tasks relating to moral, intellectual, and spiritual evolution.

3. The magickal practices within the A∴ A∴ emphasize personal exploration and tailored disciplines, while the O.T.O. specifically incorporates sexual magick and the Gnostic Mass.

Both organizations have had a significant influence on the Western esoteric tradition and continue to serve as prominent frameworks for spiritual development.
