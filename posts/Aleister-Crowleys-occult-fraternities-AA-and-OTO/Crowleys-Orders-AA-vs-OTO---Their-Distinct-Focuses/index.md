A.A. primarily focuses on individual spiritual development, while the O.T.O. functions as an organized religious institution emphasizing Thelema as its core doctrine.

Explanation:
When it comes to Aleister Crowley's occult fraternities, the A.A. (Astrum Argentum or Silver Star) and the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of Oriental Templars) serve different functions, have different objectives, and are distinct from one another.

The A.A., which primarily focuses on individual spiritual development, is a magical order dedicated to the teachings of the Hermetic and mystic traditions. The essential goal of A.A. is to provide students with a structured system of spiritual growth to attain higher states of consciousness and spiritual mastery. The structure of the A.A. comprises various degrees, with each degree representing a specific level of mastery and accomplishment.

On the other hand, the O.T.O. functions as an organized religious institution emphasizing Thelema as its core doctrine. Thelema is a spiritual and philosophical system that is based on the principle of "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, Love is the law, love under will." The O.T.O. was initially intended to serve as a fraternal organization that revolved around Masonic-like rituals. However, under Crowley's influence, the O.T.O. evolved into a more comprehensive system that incorporated the teachings of Thelema and various magical practices. Its organizational structure consists of several degrees, spanning three main orders that gradually reveal the mysteries of Thelema.

Although both A.A. and O.T.O. share the same founder and spiritual basis in Aleister Crowley's works, it is crucial to recognize the distinct objectives, teachings, and organizational structures that separate the two societies. While A.A. is primarily concerned with individual spiritual development through the pursuit of mystical and magical knowledge, the O.T.O. serves as a religious organization that openly encourages the practice and exploration of Thelema as a spiritual path.
