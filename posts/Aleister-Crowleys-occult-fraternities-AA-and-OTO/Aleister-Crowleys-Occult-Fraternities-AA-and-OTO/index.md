Lesson: Aleister Crowley's Occult Fraternities - A∴A∴ and O.T.O.

### I. Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore the world of Aleister Crowley's occult fraternities: the A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum) and the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis). As we dive into their history, belief systems, practices, and hierarchical structures, students will gain a rich knowledge and understanding of these domains. Furthermore, we will discuss the fraternities' connections to Thelema, the prominent figures within them, and their influence on modern esotericism.

### II. History

A. Astrum Argentum (A∴A∴)

Founded by Aleister Crowley and George Cecil Jones in 1907, the A∴A∴ traces its roots back to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The A∴A∴ was established as a more rigorous and structured order to promote spiritual growth and the Great Work of individual transformation. Conceived as the Outer Order of the Silver Star, the A∴A∴ also aimed to guide its initiates towards the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.

B. Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)

The O.T.O., founded in the early twentieth century by Carl Kellner and Theodor Reuss, claims roots in ancient Templar and Rosicrucianism traditions. Crowley was admitted to the order in 1910 and eventually became its leader in 1925. Under Crowley's guidance, the O.T.O. adopted Thelemic ideologies and practices, making it the first Thelemic order.

### III. Belief Systems

Both A∴A∴ and O.T.O. are centered around the belief system of Thelema, a spiritual philosophy derived from Crowley's works, primarily The Book of the Law. The main tenets of Thelema include the pursuit of one's True Will – the innermost, divine nature of the individual – and the recognition of inherent divine sovereignty in every person.

### IV. Practices

A. A∴A∴

The A∴A∴ practices a system of spiritual development called Magick, with a curriculum heavily based upon the Golden Dawn's teachings. This curriculum includes Qabalah, tarot, astrology, alchemy, yoga, meditation, and ritual magick.

The A∴A∴ focuses on individuation, encouraging each aspirant to achieve self-realization through intense personal study and practice. Each student progresses through a series of grades, which represent different stages of spiritual development. Initiates must complete prescribed tasks and submit written accounts of their experiences before advancing.

B. O.T.O.

The O.T.O.'s magickal practices center around rites and rituals, many of which incorporate sexual symbolism. The most well-known of these is the Gnostic Mass, a ceremony that shares similarities with the Christian Mass but is centered on Thelemic principles.

Unlike the A∴A∴, the O.T.O. follows a more communal structure, with lodges, chapters, and other affiliated bodies offering opportunities for initiation, fellowship, and training.

### V. Hierarchical Structures

A∴A∴

The A∴A∴ employs a hierarchical structure based on the Tree of Life in Qabalah. Each grade represents a sephirah of the Tree, signifying distinct stages in spiritual ascent. This structure encourages self-development and self-discipline, with guidance from superior ranks as the aspirant advances.

O.T.O.

The O.T.O.'s hierarchical structure features three primary orders: the Mysteria Mystica Maxima, the Order of the Eastern Templars, and the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis. These are divided into a series of degrees, echoing elements of Freemasonry. The highest ranks ultimately seek to unite the initiate's divine will with the universal current of Thelema.

### VI. Prominent Figures

Apart from Aleister Crowley and the aforementioned co-founders, prominent figures within the fraternities include Israel Regardie, Jack Parsons, Marjorie Cameron, Kenneth Grant, and Rosaleen Norton. These individuals contributed to various aspects of Thelemic theory and practice, shaping A∴A∴ and O.T.O. as they exist today.

### VII. Influence on Modern Esotericism

Both A∴A∴ and O.T.O. have significantly influenced modern esotericism. Their emphasis on self-discovery, divinity, and freedom has resonated with many spiritual seekers, inspiring countless groups and individuals worldwide. Thelema and Crowley's works also continue to be a subject of interest for scholars and spiritual practitioners alike, ensuring the enduring legacy of these fascinating fraternities.
