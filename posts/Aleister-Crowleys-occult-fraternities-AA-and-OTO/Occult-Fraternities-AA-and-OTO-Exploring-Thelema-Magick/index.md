## An In-Depth Look Into Aleister Crowley's Occult Fraternities: A∴A∴ and O.T.O.

Introduction

To fully understand the world of the esoteric and occult, one must delve into the teachings and practices of two prominent fraternities established by Aleister Crowley: the A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum) and O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis). In this lesson, we will explore the key philosophies, practices, and organizational structures of these orders, highlighting the significance of Thelema, initiation, and magick, and examine how they contribute to the overall development of an occultist's spiritual journey.

### I. A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum)

A. Key Philosophies

1. Thelema: A fundamental tenet within the A∴A∴, Thelema is a spiritual axiom declared by Crowley which posits the inherent rights of a person to determine their unique life-path. It is encapsulated by the phrase, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

2. True Will: The concept of True Will is central to A∴A∴ teachings, as it represents the intrinsic nature of the individual and their ultimate purpose in life, which they are to discover and fulfill.

3. Magick: Within the A∴A∴, magick is regarded as the method to consciously effect change in line with one's True Will. Magick practices are to be developed and honed by its members as part of their spiritual journey.

B. Practices

1. Initiation: The A∴A∴ is a highly structured and hierarchical order. Members progress through stages of initiation, each representing a deeper understanding of Thelema, magick, and their own True Will.

2. Rituals and Ceremonies: This fraternity promotes the performance of rituals and ceremonies, including the Lesser and Greater Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram, as tools to establish a connection with one's Higher Self and the invocation of entities or energies.

3. Disciplines: The A∴A∴ emphasizes a variety of disciplines, including Yoga, meditation, and divination, to foster self-mastery and spiritual growth.

C. Organizational Structure

The A∴A∴ order maintains a strict hierarchical structure, presided over by an Inner Circle. Students advance through a series of grades, with each grade corresponding to a specific spiritual state. Advancement is based on one's progress in achieving their True Will and mastery of magickal practices.

### II. O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis)

A. Key Philosophies

1. Thelema: Like the A∴A∴, the O.T.O. is founded upon the core teachings of Thelema.

2. Hierarchical Societies: The central concept of the O.T.O. is the belief that hierarchical societies offer a path towards the realization of one's True Will and the attainment of spiritual enlightenment.

3. Sexual Magick: The O.T.O. places particular emphasis on sexual magick as a method of invoking divine energies to accomplish one's True Will.

B. Practices

1. Initiation: The O.T.O. is organized into a series of degrees, with members ascending through them as they develop a deeper understanding of Thelema and hone their magickal abilities.

2. Gnostic Mass: The central ritual of the O.T.O. is the Gnostic Mass, a public ceremony which symbolically enacts the union of opposing forces to generate spiritual energy.

3. Secret rituals and ceremonies: Members of the O.T.O. participate in various secret rituals and ceremonies, which vary depending on their degree within the order. These rituals often involve sexual magick techniques designed to harness and direct spiritual power.

C. Organizational Structure

The O.T.O. is arranged in three main bodies: the Mysteria Mystica Maxima, the Order of the Eastern Templars, and the Gnostic Catholic Church. The order is further divided into a series of degrees, each associated with specific rites and rituals. Members advance in rank through initiation as they demonstrate mastery of the order's teachings and practices.

Conclusion

In summary, Aleister Crowley's occult fraternities, A∴A∴ and O.T.O., offer different yet complementary approaches to the spiritual development of an occultist. Both fraternities are grounded in the central philosophy of Thelema and prioritize the realization of one's True Will and the mastery of magick as crucial aspects of their teachings. By joining such orders, individuals embark on a journey of self-discovery, spiritual growth, and the acquisition of profound knowledge and abilities.
