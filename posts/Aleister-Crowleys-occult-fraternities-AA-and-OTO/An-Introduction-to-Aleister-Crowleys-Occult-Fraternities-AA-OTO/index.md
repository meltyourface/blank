## An Overview of Aleister Crowley's Occult Fraternities: A∴A∴ and O.T.O.

Introduction

In the early 20th century, Aleister Crowley, an influential occultist, mystic, and spiritual teacher, founded two significant occult fraternities: the A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum, or Silver Star) and the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis). The following text offers a comprehensive introduction to these organizations' histories, structures, teachings, and practices, focusing on their shared foundation in Thelema, Crowley's spiritual and philosophical system.

### I. History

The A∴A∴ was founded by Crowley in 1907, after his involvement in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a prominent 19th-century esoteric society. Seeking to create a more rigorous and unified system of spiritual attainment, he established the A∴A∴ as a mystical and initiatory order centered around the principle of Thelema.

The O.T.O., on the other hand, was founded in Germany in the early 20th century by Carl Kellner and Theodor Reuss, initially as an offspring of several European esoteric and mystical orders. Crowley became involved with the O.T.O. in 1912, integrating Thelemic principles into its structure and teachings. He eventually assumed the role of Outer Head of the Order, dramatically shaping its development and direction.

### II. Structure and Initiation

Both the A∴A∴ and O.T.O. are structured according to a graded system of initiation designed to guide members through a transformative process of spiritual growth and self-discovery.

In the A∴A∴, the initiatory structure mirrors the sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, with each grade corresponding to a sephirah. As a student advances, they undergo a series of challenges, rituals, and tests culminating in the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (a concept central in Thelemic mysticism).

The O.T.O. initiation structure is inspired by various esoteric traditions, including Freemasonry. It is divided into degrees, with each degree representing a stage of spiritual development, mastery of specific skills, and initiation into the organization's mystical secrets.

In both organizations, initiation is a vital means of spiritual transformation, intended to support members in realizing their True Will (a guiding principle in Thelema) and achieving self-mastery.

### III. Thelema and Spiritual Practices

Thelema is the unifying belief system of both the A∴A∴ and O.T.O., grounded in the central tenet: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This statement emphasizes the importance of discovering and following one's True Will, which is considered the guiding purpose of each individual's soul in their lifetime.

Both fraternities incorporate Thelemic practices such as ritual Magick, meditation, and devotion to the pursuit of spiritual attainments. Magick, in particular, is a cornerstone of their practices, as it is believed to be a powerful method for manifesting one's True Will and developing profound connections with the divine.

### IV. Magick, Symbolism, and Qabalah

Crowley's teachings emphasize the importance of using Magick, symbolism, and the Qabalistic system as tools for self-discovery and spiritual growth. These methodologies are taught extensively throughout the A∴A∴ and O.T.O., functioning as practical guides to help individuals discover and align with their True Will.

Magick is defined as the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with Will. It is practiced with the intention of manifesting desires that are aligned with the individual's higher spiritual purpose.

Symbolism is a vital component of Crowley's teachings, as it offers a language for interpreting and understanding various realms of existence. Symbols, rituals, and imagery derived from the Qabalah, astrology, tarot, and other esoteric systems are used to convey meaning, represent spiritual concepts, and facilitate communication between the practitioner and the divine.

Qabalah, an ancient esoteric tradition rooted in Jewish mysticism, plays a fundamental role in Crowley's occult fraternities. It serves as a foundational structure for understanding the universe and the human soul, encompassing both metaphysical concepts and practical methods for spiritual growth.

Conclusion

The A∴A∴ and O.T.O. serve as cornerstones of modern esotericism, rooted in Aleister Crowley's profound teachings and the incorporation of Thelema. By exploring the history, structure, and practices of these organizations, students and initiates can better grasp the rich, engaging, and transformative nature of their teachings and methods—ultimately leading to a deeper understanding and alignment with their True Will.
