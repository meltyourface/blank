- A.A. focuses on individual spiritual development, while O.T.O. emphasizes ceremonial magic and the promotion of Thelema as a social system.

The answer is that A.A. focuses on individual spiritual development, while O.T.O. emphasizes ceremonial magic and the promotion of Thelema as a social system. Both fraternities were founded by Aleister Crowley and have their roots in his system of Thelema, but they differ in their focus and methods.

A.A. (Astrum Argentum or Silver Star) was primarily designed for the spiritual development of an individual through a series of grades and instructions. The goal of A.A. is to guide the aspirant along the path of spiritual attainment, ultimately leading to the realization of the True Will and the accomplishment of the Great Work, which is the union of the individual's consciousness with the divine. Within A.A., initiates progress through a structured system of grades, many of which are modeled after the mystical system of the Qabalah. The initiation rituals and teachings in A.A. revolve around individual practices like yoga, meditation, and visualization to achieve spiritual awakening.

On the other hand, O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of the Eastern Temple) is a fraternal organization that emphasizes ceremonial magic and seeks to promote the philosophy of Thelema in a broader social context. While it does have an initiatory structure, the focus is more on communal rituals and ceremonies that engage the members in magical workings that serve to manifest the Law of Thelema and create change on a societal level. One key aspect of the O.T.O. is its use of the Gnostic Mass, a ritual ceremony that celebrates the principles of Thelema and provides a means for the community to come together in a sacred space.

It's also important to mention that Aleister Crowley's teachings on Thelema are a key influence on both fraternities. Thelema is a mystical-religious philosophy that was developed by Crowley in the early 20th century. The primary tenet of Thelema is the concept of the True Will â€“ the notion that each individual has an ultimate purpose in life, which they must discover and manifest. Thelema also puts forth the central ethical principle, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will."

In conclusion, while A.A. and O.T.O. share a common foundation in the teachings of Aleister Crowley and Thelema, they differ in their primary aims and methods. A.A. focuses on guiding individuals towards personal spiritual development, whereas the O.T.O. places more emphasis on the practice of ceremonial magic and the promotion of Thelema as a social system. By understanding the differences and similarities between these two organizations, one can appreciate the rich legacy that Aleister Crowley left behind in the world of occult practice and spiritual development.
