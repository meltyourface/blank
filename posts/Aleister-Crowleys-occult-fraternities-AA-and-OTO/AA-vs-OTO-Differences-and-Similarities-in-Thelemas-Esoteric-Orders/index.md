Answer:

To fully address this knowledge challenge, we will first provide a brief overview of the A.A. and the O.T.O., then explore the key differences and similarities in their aims and practices, and finally, discuss how these distinctions influenced the development of occult practices within Thelema. 

Overview of A.A. and O.T.O.

A.A. (Astrum Argentum or Argenteum Astrum), also known as the "Silver Star," was founded by Aleister Crowley in 1907, drawing on the teachings and practices of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The A.A. was primarily focused on the individual's spiritual evolution and sought to guide its members towards the ultimate goal of attaining knowledge and conversation with their Holy Guardian Angel, and ultimately, reaching the grade of Master of the Temple (Babe of the Abyss). 

The Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) was originally a German occult order founded by Karl Kellner and Theodor Reuss in the early 20th century. The O.T.O. adopted some of the teachings and rituals of other esoteric orders such as the Golden Dawn and Freemasonry, while also emphasizing sexual magic(k) and the role of ritual in achieving higher spiritual states. Aleister Crowley became involved with the O.T.O. in 1912, and the order subsequently incorporated the principles and teachings of the Law of Thelema, as asserted in the sacred text "Liber AL vel Legis" (The Book of the Law).

Key Differences and Similarities

1. Aims:
- A.A. focuses on the individual practitioner's spiritual advancement and personal enlightenment. The aspirant's goal is to achieve the knowledge and conversation of their Holy Guardian Angel, followed by the crossing of the Abyss and attaining the grade of Magister Templi.
- O.T.O., on the other hand, centers on group rituals and the establishment of an overarching fraternal and spiritual structure that underscores the belief in the unity of humanity. Its aim is to provide initiates with a means for personal and spiritual growth through the performance of structured rituals and ceremonies and the teaching of esoteric concepts such as sexual magic(k).

2. Practices:
- A.A. emphasizes a curriculum called the "Adeptus" system, which is a series of progressive grades and teachings, primarily based on the Qabalah and the Tree of Life. Each grade is a step towards spiritual advancement, with students practicing a particular level of magical work before attaining the next grade.
- O.T.O. adopts the structure of the initiatory degrees of Freemasonry, with ten degrees that correspond to Kabbalistic Sephiroth. The O.T.O. rituals are designed for group practice and involve various ceremonies, including initiations, rites associated with the Gnostic Mass, and the use of sexual magic(k).

Influence on Thelema and Occult Practices

These distinctions between the A.A. and O.T.O. not only shaped their individual approaches and focuses but also significantly influenced the development of occult practices within Thelema. The dual structure of A.A. and O.T.O. allowed Thelema to develop a comprehensive system of spiritual advancement, combining both personal evolution through the Adeptus system in A.A. and communal participation in ritual and ceremony through the O.T.O.

The A.A. contributed to the development of a rigorous system of magical practice within Thelema, providing aspirants with a structured path of spiritual development. The individual's journey within A.A. involves mastering various levels of knowledge and performing different practices, such as meditation, astral projection, invocations, and evocations, as well as studying occult literature.

The O.T.O., on the other hand, nurtured a more social aspect of Thelema and was instrumental in bringing forth a ceremonial and practical approach to the teachings. The practices of the O.T.O., including sexual magic, group rituals, and the Gnostic Mass, contributed significantly to the experiential elements of Thelemic spirituality, encouraging participants to explore and master both personal and collective magical workings.

In conclusion, the key differences and similarities between the aims and practices of A.A. and O.T.O. involve the A.A.'s focus on individual spiritual evolution and the O.T.O.'s emphasis on communal rituals and the unity of humanity. The distinct yet complementary approaches of these two fraternities played significant roles in shaping the development of occult practices within Thelema, fostering a comprehensive system that balances individual and collective spiritual growth.
