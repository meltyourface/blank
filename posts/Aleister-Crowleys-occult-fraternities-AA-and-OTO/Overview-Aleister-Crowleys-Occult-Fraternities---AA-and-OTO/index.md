Introduction to Aleister Crowley's Occult Fraternities: A.A. and O.T.O.

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), a British occultist, writer, and mystic, founded or was closely associated with two influential occult fraternities: the A∴A∴ (Astrum Argentum or Silver Star) and the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis). These fraternities focused on the spiritual development of the individual and the attainment of self-realization and mastery over one's own reality. This overview serves as an introduction to Crowley's occult fraternities, exploring their history, aims, objectives, rituals, practices, teachings, and key symbols, as well as notable controversies and achievements.

History:

A∴A∴: Crowley, along with his mentor, George Cecil Jones, founded the A∴A∴ in 1907. The order was conceived as a continuation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, from which Crowley and Jones had defected. The A∴A∴ synthesized various magical, mystical, and spiritual disciplines and traditions from around the world to create a comprehensive approach to personal enlightenment.

O.T.O.: Founded by Theodor Reuss, Karl Kellner, and Heinrich Klein in 1895, the O.T.O. initially incorporated elements from Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, and the then recently defunct Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. Crowley became the head of the British section of O.T.O. in 1912 and led the entire order by 1923. Under Crowley's guidance, the O.T.O. experienced significant reform and revitalization, adopting the Law of Thelema, developed by Crowley, as its core doctrine.

Main Aims and Objectives:

A∴A∴: The primary objective of the A∴A∴ is the individual attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and the crossing of the Abyss, leading to spiritual enlightenment and the realization of one's True Will. This journey is often referred to as the Great Work, which involves progressive initiations and rigorous training in multiple esoteric disciplines, including yoga, astrology, alchemy, and ceremonial magick.

O.T.O.: While the O.T.O. shares many concepts with the A∴A∴, its objectives are more focused on societal and external transformation. The aims of the O.T.O. include the establishment of the Law of Thelema and the promulgation of the fundamental principles of individual liberty, self-discovery, and the essential divinity of humanity. It offers a graded initiatory system, aiming to assist individuals in realizing their True Will and achieving personal sovereignty.

Significant Rituals and Practices:

A∴A∴: The primary practice associated with the A∴A∴ is the performance of the "Magickal Record," a detailed documentation of one's spiritual and magical development. Additionally, members engage in meditative practices, ritual magick, and other ceremonial workings aimed at spiritual transformation.

O.T.O.: Initiatory ceremonies form the core of the O.T.O.'s practices, with rituals for each grade inspired by Freemasonry and the Golden Dawn. The Gnostic Mass, a public ritual created by Crowley, celebrates the central tenets of Thelema and serves as a focal point for communal gatherings.

Essential Teachings and Key Symbols:

A∴A∴: The A∴A∴ emphasizes the concept of the "one star in sight," a metaphor for the essential unity of all beings and the inimitable spiritual journey each person must undergo. Key symbols associated with the A∴A∴ include the Silver Star (a Seven-Pointed Star), the Holy Hexagram, and the Unicursal Hexagram.

O.T.O.: The central teaching of the O.T.O. is the Law of Thelema, expressed through the primary tenet: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." Key symbols include the Ankh-Cross, the Rose-Cross Lamen, and the Mark of the Beast (a combination of the Greek letters Xi and Rho).

Notable Controversies and Achievements:

Both orders have attracted some controversy due to their emphasis on ritual magick, sexual practices, and the provocative and enigmatic figure of Aleister Crowley. Despite these issues, Crowley's occult fraternities have been influential in shaping modern occultism and the Western esoteric tradition. The inclusion and integration of various disciplines and traditions within the A∴A∴ and O.T.O., as well as their focus on personal empowerment, self-discovery, and liberty, have inspired several generations of spiritual seekers. Today, both organizations continue to hold prominence in the occult and esoteric community.
