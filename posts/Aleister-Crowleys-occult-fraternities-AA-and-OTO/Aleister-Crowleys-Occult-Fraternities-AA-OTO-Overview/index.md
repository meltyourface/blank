## Aleister Crowley's Occult Fraternities: A.A. and O.T.O.

### I. Introduction

Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), an influential figure in Western occultism, founded two prominent occult fraternities – the Astrum Argentum (A.A.) and the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Both organizations have significantly shaped modern esoteric thought and practices. In this section, we will delve into the history, teachings, rituals, and practices associated with these fraternities to provide a comprehensive understanding for students of the occult.

### II. Astrum Argentum (A.A.)

A. History and Structure

Astrum Argentum, also known as the Silver Star, was founded by Aleister Crowley in 1907 upon his return from Asia, where he had studied various Eastern mystic traditions. The A.A. incorporated elements of these traditions, along with aspects of Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Thelema – Crowley's individual spiritual philosophy. Structurally, the A.A. follows a graded initiatory system, with each member progressing through various degrees under the guidance of a superior.

B. Teachings

Central to the A.A. teachings is the concept of "True Will," the innermost divine nature of an individual that one must discover and align with to achieve spiritual enlightenment. This is closely tied to the axiom "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," which forms the core of Thelema.

Students learn techniques for personal development, spiritual exploration, and the pursuit of magical attainment. Meditations, visualizations, dream work, and invocation of divine forces are essential aspects of the A.A.'s practical curriculum.

C. Rituals and Practices

Important rituals in the A.A. include the Lesser and Greater Rituals of the Pentagram, the Star Ruby, and the Star Sapphire, all of which serve to establish a protected space for magical work and to invoke specific energies. Additionally, initiates practice Liber Resh vel Helios, a daily ritual involving adoration of the sun in its various positions throughout the day, as a means of attuning themselves with the solar current.

### III. Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)

A. History and Structure

The Ordo Templi Orientis, or Order of the Eastern Temple, originated in Germany during the early 20th century and was primarily a Masonic organization. Aleister Crowley joined the O.T.O. in 1912 and later became its leader, incorporating Thelemic principles and rituals into the Order. Like the A.A., the O.T.O. utilizes a graded initiatory system, with ten degrees through which members can progress.

B. Teachings

O.T.O. teachings emphasize the individual's spiritual journey and the attainment of true freedom, both spiritually and materially. Central to the Order's philosophy is the idea that each human being is essentially divine, and through practices such as yoga, meditation, and ceremonial magic, one can achieve greater awareness of this inherent divinity.

C. Rituals and Practices

One of the key rituals in the O.T.O. is the Gnostic Mass, a public religious ceremony which symbolizes the mysteries of human life, death, and rebirth. It serves to celebrate the divine nature of humanity and to facilitate the union between the individual and cosmic consciousness.

Another practice is "sex magick," a method of utilizing sexual energy as a force for spiritual transformation. Through conscious engagement with this energy, O.T.O. practitioners aim to transcend conventional boundaries and manifest their desires.

### IV. Conclusion

By studying the histories, teachings, rituals, and practices associated with Aleister Crowley's A.A. and O.T.O., students of the occult can gain deep insights into the Western esoteric tradition. Engaging with these practices can help one develop spiritually, understand their true nature, and navigate the complex landscape of the inner world.
