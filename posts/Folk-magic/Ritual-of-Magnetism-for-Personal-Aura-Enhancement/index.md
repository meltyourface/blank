Base Ritual: Ritual of Magnetism

The Ritual of Magnetism is an esoteric folk-magic ritual designed to enhance one's personal magnetism. This base ritual incorporates various mystic hand gestures, an enchanting incantation, and specific rare ingredients such as vervain and amethyst crystal.

Ingredients:
1. Vervain
2. Amethyst crystal
3. A silver chalice filled with moon water
4. A white candle
5. Lavender oil

Instructions:
1. Begin the ritual by setting up a sacred space aligned with your magical intentions. Anoint the white candle with lavender oil and light it.
2. Take a seat in front of the candle while holding the amethyst crystal in your left hand, and the sprig of vervain in your right hand.
3. Close your eyes and take deep, cleansing breaths while focusing your energy on your aura.
4. Open your eyes and dip your right hand with the vervain into the silver chalice containing moon water. Make sure your hand is dripping wet.
5. Gently flick the water droplets off your fingertips sprinkling the water around your sacred space while chanting the following incantation:
   "Forces of earth and spirits above,
   Strengthen my aura, enhance my love.
   Draw unto me magnetism's might,
   In attraction's grace I now alight."
6. Hold the amethyst crystal and vervain to your heart. Visualize the mystic energy of both the crystal and the herb merging with your aura, increasing your personal magnetism.
7. When you feel the enchantment is complete, extinguish the white candle. Keep the amethyst crystal and vervain with you, preferably in a small pouch, to maintain the effects of the ritual.
