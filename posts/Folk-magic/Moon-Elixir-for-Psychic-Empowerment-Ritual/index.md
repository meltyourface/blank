Elixir of Psychic Empowerment

**Ingredients**:
- 1 cup dried mugwort leaves
- 1/2 cup dried lavender flowers
- 1/2 cup clary sage leaves
- 4 cups spring water
- 1 quartz crystal, cleansed and consecrated
- 1 moonstone, cleansed and consecrated
- 1 small vial or jar

**Preparation**:

1. Gather the herbs during the waning crescent moon phase for increased psychic receptiveness.
2. Cleanse and consecrate the quartz crystal and moonstone, as they will be used in the energizing and enchanting process.
3. On the night of the new moon, place the herbs in a mortar and mix them together while focusing on the intent of increasing psychic abilities.
4. Pour the spring water into a cauldron or large pot.
5. As the water heats to a gentle simmer, recite an invocation that honors the moon, stars, and psychic energies, such as:

"By the power of the moon and all her phases,
By the wisdom of the stars and their cosmic traces,
Bring forth psychic gifts and opening of sight,
Reveal to me the hidden worlds of night."

6. Add the mixed herbs to the simmering water. Allow the herbs to simmer in the water for 15 minutes while meditating on your intention.
7. Strain the liquid into a heatproof container, leaving behind the solid herbs. Dispose of the herbs respectfully by burying them or returning them to nature.
8. Allow the elixir to cool. As it cools, begin to charge it with the energies of the quartz crystal and the moonstone placed nearby.
9. When the elixir has cooled, bottle it in a small vial or jar. Seal the jar with a colored wax corresponding to psychic energy (such as purple or silver). Draw a rune or symbol of psychic power on the outside of the jar as a final mark of enchantment.

Enchantment Ritual:

1. Find a solitary location outdoors where you can sit under the open sky on the night of the full moon.
2. Construct a circle of stones, candles, or other natural elements, symbolizing the boundary between the mundane and the mystical.
3. Enter the circle with the elixir and close the boundary, creating an energetically protective space.
4. Light a purple or silver candle to evoke the energy of psychic power.
5. Hold the vial of elixir, focusing on your intention to enhance your psychic abilities. Imagine a beam of light connecting you with the celestial bodies, drawing down their power into the elixir.
6. Recite a chant or prayer dedicated to empowering the elixir and your psychic receptiveness:

"Moon and stars above, empower this brew,
Grant me psychic vision, insights clear and true.
By the light of the full moon's radiant glow,
May my third eye open, and my visions grow."

7. When the ritual is complete, give thanks to the energies and spirits that have assisted you. Ground yourself and open the circle, returning to the mundane world.
8. Keep the elixir in a cool, dark place until needed. Take small sips when you wish to enhance your psychic abilities for divination, meditation, or other esoteric practices.

Always approach the use of such elixirs with reverence and respect, as they are intended to foster a deeper connection with the metaphysical energies that shape our existence.
