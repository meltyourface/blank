---
To complete the comprehensive Egyptian Tarot reading for a client requesting career advice, we will utilize a 9-card spread that takes into account their ambitions, potential obstacles, and opportunities for growth in their professional journey. This spread will help provide a complete understanding of their current situation, possible challenges, and guidance for the future.

1. **The Present Situation**: This card represents the client's current standing in their career.
2. **The Ambitions**: This card represents the client's aspirations and goals in their professional life.
3. **The Potential Obstacles**: This card represents any challenges or difficulties the client may face in achieving their ambitions.
4. **The Hidden Opportunities**: This card signifies the hidden possibilities that the client may not be aware of but could lead to professional growth.
5. **The Skills**: This card represents the abilities and talents the client possesses that will help them reach their ambitions.
6. **The External Influences**: This card represents outside factors or people that may have an impact on the client's career trajectory.
7. **The Ways to Overcome Obstacles**: This card offers insights on how the client can address the challenges they encounter.
8. **The Desired Outcome**: This card provides a glimpse of the potential achievement the client can attain if they follow the advice and guidance provided.
9. **The Final Advice**: This card offers overall guidance and wisdom for the client's professional journey.

The reading begins with a shuffle of the Egyptian Tarot deck and an intention set by the client to receive insights into their career. Then, the nine cards are drawn and laid out in the specific order described above.

For this example reading, I will draw the following cards:

1. **Present Situation**: Ace of Swords
2. **Ambitions**: Queen of Pentacles
3. **Potential Obstacles**: The Moon
4. **Hidden Opportunities**: The Magician
5. **Skills**: Strength
6. **External Influences**: The Hierophant
7. **Ways to Overcome Obstacles**: The Chariot
8. **Desired Outcome**: The World
9. **Final Advice**: The Star

Interpretation:
1. **The Present Situation (Ace of Swords)**: This card signifies new beginnings, mental clarity, and decisive actions. The client may have recently started a new career path or achieved a breakthrough in understanding their career aspirations.
2. **Ambitions (Queen of Pentacles)**: The Queen of Pentacles represents nurturing ambitions and creating a sense of financial security and stability. The client seeks to achieve professional success by building a stable and secure career that will provide for themselves and their loved ones.
3. **Potential Obstacles (The Moon)**: The Moon symbolizes illusion, confusion, and anxiety. The client may encounter emotional obstacles on their journey, such as fears or self-doubt, that could cloud their judgment and decision-making capabilities.
4. **Hidden Opportunities (The Magician)**: This card indicates that the client has the potential to manifest their desires and ambitions through their talents and skills. By recognizing and utilizing their abilities, the client opens the door for more opportunities to grow professionally.
5. **Skills (Strength)**: The Strength card suggests that the client possesses strong willpower, courage, and determination, which are valuable skills in overcoming challenges in their career.
6. **External Influences (The Hierophant)**: The Hierophant signifies the importance of learning from mentors, tradition, and structure. The client may benefit from seeking guidance from experienced professionals or following established pathways in their industry.
7. **Ways to Overcome Obstacles (The Chariot)**: The Chariot represents self-discipline, focus, and determination. The client will need to harness these traits to overcome obstacles and successfully navigate their professional journey.
8. **Desired Outcome (The World)**: The World card signifies the completion of a cycle and the attainment of wholeness. If the client follows the guidance provided, they may achieve their career ambitions, gaining fulfillment and satisfaction from their professional endeavors.
9. **Final Advice (The Star)**: The Star card offers hope, inspiration, and guidance. The client should maintain a positive attitude and trust in their abilities and intuition, allowing them to remain resilient and optimistic in their career pursuits.

Overall, the reading suggests that the client has the skills and determination to achieve their career ambitions, but they will need to address the emotional obstacles and seek guidance from external sources. By staying focused and drawing on their strengths, the client will have the opportunity to attain their desired outcome and experience growth in their professional journey.
