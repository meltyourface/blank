## Title: Astral Projection - A Guided Meditation for Most Excellent Masters

Introduction:
Welcome, Most Excellent Master. Take a moment to prepare your space for this sacred journey. Ensure that you are seated in a comfortable position, in a location where you will not be disturbed. Take deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, as you allow your mind and body to relax.
**Step 1**: Setting the Environment:
In order to establish a safe and secure environment for your astral journey, begin by visualizing a brilliant, golden sphere of protective energy surrounding your entire being. Feel the warmth of this sphere as it pulsates and resonates with the lost word, the ineffable name of the divine architect. As you visualize this powerful and sacred energy, call upon the protection and guidance of archangels, who serve as your astral guardians.

Alternatively, you may trace the sacred geometric shapes of Metatron's Cube or the Flower of Life around your space to create an impenetrable shield against unwanted energies.
**Step 2**: Astral Anchors:
As you journey to the astral plane, it is important to establish an anchor to maintain a connection with your physical body. Visualize an ethereal silver cord attached between your navel and your astral body. This cord is unbreakable and will ensure a safe return to your physical form.
**Step 3**: Breathing Techniques:
Incorporate the unique breathing techniques of the Most Excellent Master degree. With each inhale, envision the breath circulating throughout your physical body, energizing and purifying your cells. As you exhale, focus on the exhalation extending beyond your body, merging with the cosmic energy that surrounds us all.
**Step 4**: Visualization and Vibrational Frequencies:
Visualize yourself standing in a sacred temple of the Most Excellent Masters. Within this temple, you are surrounded by ancient symbols and depictions of sacred geometry, leading you towards an understanding of the divine architect's plan. As you peer into the heart of this temple, notice a radiant, glowing doorway. Feel the vibrational frequencies associated with the Most Excellent Master degree resonating within you, empowering you to step through the doorway and enter the astral plane.
**Step 5**: Astral Projection:
With the protective energy and astral anchors in place, visualize your astral body slowly rising above your physical body. Observe your surroundings from this new perspective as you gently rise higher and higher. Travel through the doorway within the temple, entering the astral plane.

As you explore this realm, remain ever vigilant for the guidance of the archangels and the teachings of the Most Excellent Master degree. Take note of the patterns and energies you encounter, for they have much to teach you about the divine architect's grand plan.

When you are ready to return, focus on the silver cord, pulling you gently back to your physical body. As you reintegrate, offer gratitude for the experiences you have had and the knowledge you have gained.

Conclude your guided meditation by calling upon the blessings and wisdom of the divine architect, and carry these teachings with you as you continue your journey as a Most Excellent Master.

This concludes the guided meditation for astral projection, specifically tailored for practitioners of the Most Excellent Master degree. Safe travels, and remember the wisdom that resides within you.
