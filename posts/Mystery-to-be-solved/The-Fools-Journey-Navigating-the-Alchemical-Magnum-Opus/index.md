To answer this challenge, we need to delve into the understanding of the Hermetic tradition, the Tarot, and the alchemical Magnum Opus, as well as the connections between these concepts. The synthesis of these elements will illuminate the path towards solving the grand enigma of existence.

The Hermetic Tradition and the Interconnectedness of the Universe:
The Hermetic tradition is a philosophical system that emerged in late antiquity and is based on the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, most notably the "Emerald Tablet." Its core belief is that the universe is one interconnected, living entity, and everything within it is interrelated. This principle is succinctly expressed in the saying "As above, so below." Hermeticism posits that by understanding the divine principles governing the cosmos, one can develop a greater knowledge of self and attain spiritual and intellectual transformation.

The Tarot and "The Fool":
The Tarot is a symbolic system representing the cosmos, consisting of 78 cards divided into 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana. The Fool is the first card of the Major Arcana (numbered 0), depicting a young man standing on a precipice, holding a knapsack and a white rose with a dog at his feet.

The Fool symbolizes the state of being open to possibility and the potential that lies before us at the beginning of a new phase or journey. As the "pure spirit," The Fool represents the unconditioned mind, untarnished by the experiences and baggage that we accumulate throughout our lives. In this sense, The Fool represents our innate wisdom and receptiveness to the interconnectedness of the universe and the mysterious nature of life.

The Alchemical Magnum Opus:
The Magnum Opus is the ultimate goal of alchemists, traditionally represented as the transmutation of base metals into gold or, more spiritually, the transformation of the leaden human soul into the golden divine spirit. This process consists of several stages (nigredo, albedo, and rubedo) and involves the purification, dissolution, and reintegration of one's psyche, physical body, and spiritual essence to reach enlightenment and immortality.

Synthesis and Enlightening the Path towards Solving the Grand Enigma of Existence:
The Fool's connection to the alchemical Magnum Opus lies in the process of transformation and the idea of the interconnectedness of the universe. As an archetype, The Fool embodies the beginning of the journey and the potential for transformation through experiencing the mysteries of the cosmos.

In the context of the Magnum Opus, The Fool represents the initial nigredo stage, characterized by the state of spiritual darkness and ignorance. The journey of The Fool is akin to the alchemical process where the individual undergoes a series of trials, tribulations, and transformative experiences that lead towards enlightenment.

By engaging with the insights provided by the Hermetic tradition, the symbolic language of the Tarot, and the alchemical Magnum Opus, the seeker (initiate or student) begins to recognize the interrelated nature of existence and the divine principles underlying it. Through this understanding, they are emboldened to undertake their journey of self-discovery, transformation, and enlightenment.

In conclusion, The Fool's connection to the alchemical Magnum Opus lies in its embodiment of the beginning of the transformative journey towards self-realization and enlightenment. By synthesizing the wisdom of the Hermetic tradition, the symbolism of the Tarot, and the alchemical process of the Magnum Opus, an individual becomes enlightened to the interconnectedness of the universe, which acts as a guide for navigating and ultimately solving the grand enigma of existence. Key themes in this synthesis include the cosmic interconnectedness, spiritual transformation, and personal growth towards enlightenment.
