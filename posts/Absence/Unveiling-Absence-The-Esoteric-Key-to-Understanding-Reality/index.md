In the context of occultism and esotericism, the concept of absence can be defined as the void, the unseen, or the non-manifested aspects of reality that are beyond the mundane physical world. It encompasses the mysteries and hidden forces behind the veil of our perceivable existence. To gain insight into the interconnectedness of the unseen realms, the manifestation of individual will, and the pursuit of enlightenment, we need to examine the role of absence and its practical applications within these key areas.

1. Interconnectedness of unseen realms: 

The unseen realms can refer to a variety of concepts, such as the astral plane, the mental plane, the etheric plane, and other dimensions of existence. In esoteric practices, absence serves as the foundation, the canvas on which these realities are intertwined. Since these realms are not physically tangible, initiates must develop their intuition, psychic faculties, and astral senses in order to gain wisdom and understanding of these intricate planes. 

For instance, the Hermetic principle of correspondence, "As above, so below; as below, so above," elucidates the interconnectedness of the various planes of existence. By meditating and exploring the concept of absence, one can delve into the hidden aspects and relationships between these realms, ultimately uncovering the fundamental underlying unity that pervades all forms of reality. In this way, absence serves as both a gateway and a catalyst for exploration.

2. Manifestation of individual will:

The concept of absence holds great importance in understanding the manifestation of individual will, which comprises intention, desire, and action. In disciplines such as Chaos Magick, practitioners use the concept of "paradigm shifting" to adopt different belief systems temporarily as a means to achieve desired results. The state of absence here represents a state of psychological or mental flexibility, which is vital for true transformation.

In the context of manifestation, absence represents the unseen potential energies and unmanifested possibilities that exist before a goal or desire is brought into physical reality. It can also refer to the unformed creative force and chaos from which individual will can give shape to new realities. Consider the analogy of a sculptor chiseling away at a block of marble - it is the absence of material from the block (resulting from the sculptor's intentional actions) that shapes the artistic piece.

3. Pursuit of Enlightenment:

In Eastern traditions, the absence concept is closely related to the idea of emptiness (such as in Buddhism with the term "śūnyatā") or the ultimate nature of reality. In the pursuit of enlightenment, initiates need to understand and realize the nature of absence, which transcends dualistic concepts (such as existence and non-existence, matter and spirit, etc.) and helps to tap into the true, undifferentiated nature of reality.

Furthermore, contemplation and meditation on absence can aid in detaching from material desires, attachments, and egoic illusions that hinder spiritual progress. This detachment serves as a cornerstone for practices such as mindfulness, where initiates can observe their thoughts and emotions without judgment or attachment, ultimately reaching a state of enlightenment or spiritual awakening.

In summary, the concept of absence in occultism and esotericism provides a practical framework for exploring the interconnectedness of unseen realms, manifesting individual will, and pursuing enlightenment. It acts as a bridge that unites the mysterious, non-manifested aspects of reality with our experiential, tangible existence. By understanding and embracing the nature of absence, initiates can unravel deeper layers of truth within themselves and the cosmos, transcending the barriers of the mundane and achieving profound spiritual insights.
