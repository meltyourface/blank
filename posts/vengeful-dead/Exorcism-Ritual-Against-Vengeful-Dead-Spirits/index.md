## I. **Incantation for Banishing the Vengeful Dead**:

In the tongue of ancient necromancers, let the words flow in a rhythmic chant, evoking the necessary forces to command the vengeful dead:

"Salve, mortui vindictam petentibus, ego te in nomine potestatis antiquae conjuro!
Ex inferis, ad superos, meo jussu desciscite patibulo!"

(Translation: Hail, vengeful dead, I conjure you in the name of ancient power! From the underworld, to the heavens, release your hold by my command!)

Repeat this potent incantation as the ritual unfolds, for its power only grows with each repetition.

### II. **Sigils for Trapping and Exiling Malevolent Entities**:

1. **The Seal of Solomon**: On a parchment of goat's skin, draw the Seal of Solomon, a hexagram of two interlaced triangles symbolizing divine protection. Place it in the center of the ritual space, where it will bind the spirit within its boundaries.

2. **The Mystic Rose**: Around the Seal of Solomon, inscribe the Mystic Rose, with its twelve petals representing the twelve gates of the underworld. This ethereal blossom will tempt the malevolent entity into its snares and force it out of the mortal realm.

3. **The Pentad of Possession**: Encircling the Mystic Rose, create a protective barrier with the Pentad of Possession, a five-pointed star embedded with five entwined serpents devouring their tails. This sigil will prevent any additional spirits from entering, forcing the entity to confront its banishment alone.

### III. **Requisition of a Guardian Spirit**:

During the incantations, call upon the spirit guide Caelion, an ancestral protector of the living realm:

"Spiritus Caelion, tuam auxilium precor, contra hostes mortuos me defende!"

(Translation: Spirit Caelion, I beseech your assistance, defend me from the enemies of the dead!)

### IV. **Essential Items and Offerings**:

1. **Grave Dirt**: Collect the earth from the grave of the recently departed, sprinkling it around the sigils to strengthen the connection to the underworld.
2. **Coffin Nails**: Surround the ritual space with coffin nails from those who passed peacefully, creating a barrier to ward off malevolence.
3. **Enchanted Talisman**: Wear an amulet of obsidian, inscribed with the sigil of the Necromancer's Knot to imbue the ritual with the full force of ancient necrotic power.

### V. **Timing and Temporal Factors**:

Perform the exorcism during the height of the witching hour (3 AM) during the waning crescent moon. The veil between realms will weaken, granting enhanced potency to the ritual. Choose a night of thunderstorms, to summon the raw, elemental energy needed to banish such a formidable entity.

Armed with the knowledge, invocations, and artifacts to cast down the vengeful dead, follow these intricate steps and bring a powerful end to the malevolent spirit's reign of terror, restoring balance to the realm of the living. The ritual exudes a sense of menace and ancient power that resonates with the domain of the vengeful dead, all while evoking a deep-seated awe for the complexities and mysteries that lie hidden in the shadows of existence.
