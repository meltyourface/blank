Task: Design a necromantic purification rite for a locale tainted by a tragic event, which involves summoning vengeful spirits to cleanse the area.

Necromantic Purification Rite: The Rite of Hallowed Revenants

Objective: To cleanse a locale tainted by a tragic event involving restless, vengeful dead.

Components required:

1. **Ritual Symbols**: a. Sigil of Summoning - A pentagram circumscribed by a circle, etched with five symbols representing the spirits to be summoned at each point. b. Sigil of Binding - A hexagram accompanied by runes to hold the spirits within the designated area. c. Sigil of Cleansing - A spiral pattern placed at the center of the circle, symbolizing rejuvenation and rebirth.

2. **Tools for channeling ethereal energy**: a. Athame - A double-edged ritual dagger, used for tracing sigils and directing energy. b. Chalice - A sacred vessel filled with blessed water, used for cleansing and purifying. c. Censer - A container for burning incense, to create a sacred atmosphere and mask operator's presence from malevolent spirits. d. Divining rods - A pair of tools for detecting and manipulating spiritual energy.

3. **Offerings to appease the restless dead**: a. Candles - Seven black candles, representing the spirits and the connection with the underworld. b. Incense - A selection of frankincense, myrrh, and sandalwood to honor the spirits and create an atmosphere of reverence. c. Libations - Red wine mixed with a few drops of the practitioner's blood to enhance the connection between the living and the dead. d. Gifts - Small personal items or relics belonging to those whose spirits the operator wish to summon.

Ritual performance:

1. **Preparation**: a. Cleanse the area with the chalice's blessed water and censer's incense. b. Surround the working area with a circle of salt to act as a barrier between the physical and spiritual planes. c. Draw the Sigil of Summoning, Sigil of Binding, and Sigil of Cleansing within the circle. d. Place the offerings outside the circle near the Sigil of Summoning. e. Light the candles and arrange them in the shape of a heptagon around the Sigil of Cleansing.

2. **Summoning**: a. **Stand at the Sigil of Summoning and recite the incantation**:

"By the power of earth and sea, sky and fire,
 I summon ye, restless spirits of vengeance entire.
 Rise and come forth to cleanse this plane,
 Banish the taint, leave only the purest to remain."
 b. Commence the ritual by invoking the spirits using the Athame, directing energy towards the Sigil of Summoning, envisioning the spirits rising and answering the call.
  
3. **Binding**: a. Move to the Sigil of Binding, and recite the following incantation:

"Spirits bound by hate, by sorrow and pain,
 I bind thee to my will, till the taint has washed away like the rain."
 b. Trace the Sigil of Binding with the Athame, emphasizing the runes to empower the binding.

4. **Cleansing**: a. Stand at the Sigil of Cleansing, and recite the final incantation:

"Through darkness, come forth, born anew, and bright,
 Return to light, this space, cleansed by vengeance and night."
 b. Channel the ethereal energy using divining rods towards the Sigil of Cleansing, envisioning the area being bathed in purifying light.

Potential complications and responses:

1. **Malevolent spirits may attempt to hijack the ritual**: a. Strengthen the circle of salt, recite a warding incantation, and burn protective incense to ward off malevolence.

2. **Unwilling spirits may resist binding or cleansing**: a. Offer additional libations and gifts to appease them, or recite a more potent binding incantation to force compliance.

3. **The purification is incomplete**: a. Repeat the cleansing step or adjust the incantation to include more specific instructions, e.g., targeting specific sources of taint or tragedy.

4. **Spirits refuse to depart after the cleansing**: a. Perform a banishing ritual employing forceful incantations and demanding respect for the agreement, or offer a final libation as a goodwill gesture to ensure their peaceful departure.

Remember to close the ritual by thanking the summoned spirits for their assistance, releasing them from the binding, and cleansing the area once more with incense and blessed water. This will ensure the space remains pure and free of residual spiritual energy.
