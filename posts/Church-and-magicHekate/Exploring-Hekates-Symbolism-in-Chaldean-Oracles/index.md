The Chaldean Oracles, though originating in the 2nd century AD, hold significant importance within the realm of the esoteric, occult, Church, and magicHekate. This collection of mystical aphorisms and verses delves into the metaphysical and theurgical aspects that connect humanity to the divine, and many of them relate to the goddess Hekate. In this analysis, we will explore the symbolism associated with the Chaldean Oracles, identifying key elements that pertain to Hekatean theology, magical practice, spirituality, and religious doctrine.

Firstly, one must understand Hekate's role in theurgy as a divine mediator. The Chaldean Oracles emphasize her position as the Cosmic Soul or World Soul, bridging the gap between the spiritual and the physical realms. Through this role, Hekate allows the initiate to traverse the multilayered cosmos, guiding them on their path towards spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine.

Several symbols within the Chaldean Oracles directly connect to Hekate, such as the torch, the serpent, and the key. The torch represents her role as a light-bringer, illuminating the paths of darkness for those who seek knowledge and insight. The serpent symbolizes her connection with the Earth, as well as transformation and rebirth. The key signifies her ability to unlock the doors of the spiritual realm, granting access to higher planes of consciousness.

There are also subtle connections to Hekate's triple nature and the concept of the triformis statue. In one aphorism, the Oracle speaks of a "Three-headed Serpent" that is "stabilized around a single Matter." This imagery may allude to Hekate's role as a goddess of liminal spaces who operates simultaneously within different realms, providing valuable insight and protection for the practitioner.

Comparing the symbolism found in the Chaldean Oracles with that of other Hekatean artifacts only serves to enrich our understanding of her influence. The Gundestrup Cauldron, a silverwork artifact dating back to the 1st century BC, contains images believed to depict Hekate. One panel features a feminine figure holding a torch and a key, surrounded by animals such as dogs, stags, and serpents. The presence of these symbols strengthens the cauldron's connection to Hekate as a goddess of the crossroads and the natural world.

The Hekate triformis statue, a classic representation of the goddess with three faces, similarly highlights her multifaceted nature and relationship with the spirit world. This iconography captures the goddessâ€™ ability to see the past, present, and future, encompassing her essence as a divine liaison between the mortal and spiritual planes.

In conclusion, the Chaldean Oracles are a rich source of symbolism and theology related to Hekate, displaying her essential role in theurgy, magical practice, and religious doctrine. Through the exploration of elemental symbols and comparative review of artifacts such as the Gundestrup Cauldron and the Hekate triformis statue, a comprehensive understanding of her influence and power within esoteric and occult domains can be achieved. This knowledge further positions Hekate as a central figure in the pursuit of spiritual and mystical advancement.
