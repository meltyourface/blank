excerpt: > 
  Compose an original invocation to Hekate, the goddess of witchcraft, crossroads, and the underworld, tailored specifically for a nocturnal ritual in a consecrated Church of Hekate space. Infuse the incantation with precise elements, such as references to her role as Torchbearer and Keybearer, as well as the use of triplicities (three-fold aspects) that embody her nature. Incorporate the recitation of this invocation into an elaborate, multi-part ceremony that includes the offering of traditional Hekatean libations, such as honey, wine, and eggs, the proper arrangement of her sacred symbols like strophalos and keys, and the utilization of consecrated ritual tools to create a profound and transformative experience.

## I. Preparation

Before the ceremony begins, ensure that the consecrated Church of Hekate space is clean and properly arranged. Set up an altar to Hekate with a black or deep purple cloth, adorned with her symbols such as the strophalos, a triple-key symbol, and images or statues depicting the goddess. Light three candles, representing her triplicities, one placed to the left, middle, and right of the altar.

Place the ritual tools, such as a chalice for libations, a ritual dagger or athame to direct energy, and a censer with charcoal and incense, at the center of the altar.

### II. Purification and Grounding

Stand in front of the altar, take a few deep breaths, and ground yourself. **Invoke Earth energies to cleanse and purify your space**:

"Earth below, I invoke thee,
Salt of the land, cleanse and purify me,
Create a sacred circle, true and free,
I invoke the ancient Hekate's mystery."

Use the ritual dagger or athame to draw the circle, starting at the East and moving clockwise around the room. As you circumscribe, say:

"Sacred circle I cast, sacred space I create,
By Hekate's grace, all that is unclean shall abate."

Return to the altar and light the incense, allowing the smoke to purify the space.

### III. Invocation

Recite the Invocation to Hekate:

"Darkness envelops, night has fallen,
To Hekate, queen of witchcraft, I am calling.
Torchbearer divine, guiding light through mystery,
Keybearer of realms, unlock your power, I plea.

Goddess of three-fold nature, crescent, full, and old,
Crossroads I traverse under your protective hold.
To Guardians, Spirits, and Hekatean kin I meet,
In this sacred Church, I humbly bow and greet.

I stand between worlds, invoking thee anew,
By strophalos, sacred keys, and fire's dancing hue,
I raise my voice and my offering I convey,
Honey, wine, and eggs, in devotion I lay.

Empower and guide, share your wisdom in this rite,
Transformation within, embrace your goddess' night.
Hail Hekate, revered and eternally wise,
By the power of triplicities, I summon thee to rise."

### IV. Offerings

Pour honey, wine, and break open an egg into the chalice, while reciting the following:

"By coin, by crust, and honey sweet,
With wine to honor and eggs at your feet,
These offerings I give, we end the old and start the new,
To Hekate, with love and respect, I dedicate these to you."

### V. Closing

Having received Hekate's guidance and energies during the ritual, give thanks and ask her to depart:

"Thank you, Hekate, for your presence and your boon,
This gathering now ends, shadows flee as morning looms.
Torchbearer divine, guide me beyond these hallowed walls,
Blessed am I by your touch, your child hears your call."

Extinguish the candles and take a deep breath to ground yourself. Let the chalice's contents be left in a suitable outdoor location, as a libation for Hekate and her kina.

With the ceremony complete, you have successfully drawn upon the potent energies of Hekate and honored her through the ritual's elaborate and precise structure.
