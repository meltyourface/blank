Invocation of Thoth for the Esoteric Ritual of the Pyramid

### I. Preparation

1. Set the ritual space within a sanctum aligned to the cardinal directions (East, West, North, and South) and to the axis of Orion's Belt, representing the connection between the earthly plane and the celestial realm.

2. Cleanse and purify the sanctum using sacred smoke from frankincense and myrrh, symbolizing devotion and purification.

3. Draw the sacred geometry of the Pyramid upon the ground, creating an Octahedron inside a circle. This reflections the balance of the element Earth (the base) and Air (the tip), needed for the enhanced wisdom regarding construction and energy manipulation.

4. Position four sacred symbols of Thoth at each of the cardinal directions: the Moon disk for the East, the Ibis in the West, the Caduceus in the North, and the Ankhu for the South. Each of these represents the aspects of knowledge, scribe arts, healing, and eternal life brought forth by Thoth.

5. Clothe yourself in pure white linen, signifying purity, higher consciousness, and connection to the divine.

### II. The Invocation

1. Begin in the East, facing the sacred symbol of the Moon disk. Raise your hands to the sky and recite:

"Oh Thoth, great keeper of knowledge, Lord of Time and master of ancient wisdom, I beseech thee to grant me insight and guidance. Illumine my path in the mystery of the Pyramid, as the celestial Magus that governs the cosmic order."

2. Move clockwise to the West, facing the sacred symbol of the Ibis. Raise your hands to the sky and recite:

"Thoth, Divine Scribe, guide my hand and mind in the divine art of the Pyramid, its structure, and energy flow. Teach me the ancient hieroglyphs and codes to decipher and channel its hidden knowledge. Unveil the mysteries of sacred geometry, and elevate my consciousness to grasp the majesty of your designs."

3. Continue clockwise to the North, facing the sacred symbol of the Caduceus. Raise your hands to the sky and recite:

"Thoth, master of Healing, imbue me with the understanding of the Pyramid's healing properties and the power of converging celestial energies. Teach me to harness these energies for the benefit of body, mind, and soul, awakening the full potential of my being."

4. Move clockwise to the South, facing the sacred symbol of the Ankhu. Raise your hands to the sky and recite:

"Thoth, granter of Immortal Life, lead me through the labyrinth of time and space as I master the alignment of Pyramid to the celestial bodies, so that I may truly comprehend the eternal streams of wisdom and the secrets of the universe."

### III. The Sealing

1. Return to the center of the Octahedron, standing within the circle of sacred geometry. Raise your hands to the sky and recite:

"I humbly accept the blessings of Thoth, the Sophic Archon, for the mastery of the Pyramid, its construction, energy manipulation, and celestial alignments. With this invocation, I shall strive to embody wisdom, knowledge, and higher consciousness, honoring the divine order and balance of creation."

2. Slowly lower your arms and feel the presence of Thoth's wisdom descending upon you, flowing through each of the sacred symbols, infusing your mind, body, and spirit with his celestial knowledge.

3. Finally, express your gratitude and reverence for Thoth, the divine teacher, and close the ritual with enhanced wisdom and divine guidance from the celestial patron of the Pyramid.

In this manner, the complex structure of the invocation will channel the deep understanding of Thoth, activating higher levels of consciousness for the practitioner and allowing them to achieve mastery in pyramid construction, energy manipulation, celestial alignment, and all related esoteric and occult domains.
