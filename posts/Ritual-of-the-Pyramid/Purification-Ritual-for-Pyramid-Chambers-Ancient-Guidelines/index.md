To perform the intricate purification ritual for a pyramid chamber, one must abide by the profound principles of mystic symbolism, sacred geometry, and esoteric knowledge specific to the Ritual of the Pyramid tradition. Below are the preparatory steps, necessary materials, and invocations of ancient energies to cleanse and sanctify the space for powerful ceremonial workings.

Preparatory steps:

1. Clear all clutter and debris from the pyramid chamber, both physical and energetic. Sweep the floors and dust the surfaces to create a pristine environment.
   
2. Begin to gradually raise one's energy and intentions by meditating on the purpose of the purification ritual. Connect with the ancient powers and wisdom that the pyramids have housed for centuries.

3. Gather the necessary materials and sacred items.

Necessary materials and sacred items:

1. Sanctified water from the River Nile, imbued with sacred blessings for purification purposes.
   
2. Incense, such as frankincense, myrrh, and sandalwood, to purify the air and create a pleasant scent.
   
3. A ritual knife known as the Khopesh, utilized to cut away negative energies and carve necessary symbols.
   
4. Blessed salt for drawing protective sigils and a sacred circle around the pyramid chamber.
   
5. An ornate chalice of gold or silver, filled with sacred oil for anointing the chamber's corners.
   
6. Crystals such as moldavite, lapis lazuli, and clear quartz – aligned with pyramid power – to amplify the energies.

Invocation of ancient energies:

1. Stand at the center of the pyramid chamber, face north, and recite the Invocation of Horus: "In the name of the Mighty and Eternal Horus, I conjure the divine energies safeguarding this sacred chamber. May the blessings of purification fill this space."

2. Move to the east and recite the Invocation of Isis: "By the grace of the Goddess Isis, let the boundless compassion, wisdom, and spiritual understanding bless this hallowed space."

3. Face south and invoke the energies of Osiris: "Great Osiris, God of resurrection, death, and rebirth, infuse this chamber with the power to transform and sanctify."

4. Turn towards the west and recite the Invocation of Thoth: "Grand Thoth, embodiment of knowledge, truth, and wisdom, grace this chamber with the potency of your vast intellect."

Arrangement and interaction of the chamber elements:

1. Align the pyramid chamber with the four cardinal directions of north, south, east, and west, creating a harmonious framework for the potent energies to channel.
   
2. Arrange the sacred items on a central altar, which may be covered by a linen cloth in gold, symbolizing both the sun's power and royalty.
   
3. Place crystals at the corner points of the room, creating a sacred geometric pattern that emphasizes balance and amplification of energy.
   
4. Cast a circle of blessed salt around the chamber, allowing its protective qualities to filter negativity and bless the sacred space.
   
5. Light the incense and let the smoke waft gently throughout the chamber, filling the interior with divine aromas that cleanse the environment.

Completion of the purification ritual:

Having invoked the ancient energies, arranged the intentional elemental interactions, and manifested the enigmatic atmosphere, the purification ritual shall be deemed complete. The practitioner may choose to offer thanks to the deities and close the space in a manner appropriate to their personal tradition. The pyramid chamber is now primed for powerful ceremonial workings, infused with the mystic symbolism, sacred geometry, and esoteric knowledge of the Ritual of the Pyramid.
