In devising an intricate fetichism-based system for manipulating energy flows and channeling occult forces, we can use various crystals that embody different energetic properties and work together to harness both malevolent and benevolent energies. This setup can be used in rituals and metaphysical healing sessions to maximize the desired outcome.

To begin with, we will need a combination of crystals that represent the various forms of energy we wish to manipulate. Here's a list of some powerful crystals and their properties:

1. Clear Quartz: Master healer and amplifier of energies.
2. Selenite: Promotes clarity, cleansing, and connection to the higher self.
3. Black Tourmaline: Protective and grounding, dispels negative energies.
4. Amethyst: Enhances intuition and spiritual growth while protecting from harm.
5. Carnelian: Boosts courage, motivation, and creativity.
6. Rose Quartz: Encourages unconditional love and emotional healing.
7. Moldavite: Aids transformation and enhances psychic abilities.
8. Obsidian: Absorbs negative energies and helps with shadow work.

Now, to establish the system, we will need to follow these steps:

1. Prepare the space: Before beginning, cleanse the area where the ritual or healing session will take place. It can be an indoor altar or outdoor sacred space. Employ incense, white sage, or Palo Santo to cleanse the energies and set the intentions.

2. Crystal Grid Formation: Arrange the crystals in a circular or geometric pattern, depending on the specific goals of the ritual or healing session. For example, if the primary intention is protection, position the Black Tourmaline at the center and create a protective barrier around it using Clear Quartz and Obsidian. Integrate Amethyst or Moldavite for enhanced intuition and transformation.

3. Charging the Crystals: Once the crystal grid is established, focus on tapping into each crystal's energy and programming them with the desired intention. Use a clear and concise mental picture of the outcome you want to achieve. Be careful when charging crystals with malevolent intents, as these energies can negatively impact the user if not properly handled.

4. Activation and Channeling: Start activating the grid with a wand or your hand, moving clockwise, connecting each crystal with a continuous line of energy. As you activate the grid, visualize your intentions and the specific energy flow being manipulated or channeled. When the grid is activated, the combined energy of the crystals will be harnessed.

5. Ritual or Healing Session: Conduct your intended ritual or healing session while the activated crystal grid serves as your energetic foundation. Whether you are summoning forces or using metaphysical healing practices, your intentions will be amplified, and the energies will be guided, supported, and channeled by the crystal grid.

6. Conclusion: After completing the ritual or healing session, it's essential to give thanks to the energies and entities involved and to deactivate the crystal grid by moving your hand or wand counterclockwise. Store the crystals safely and cleanse them after usage, especially those charged with malevolent intents.

Remember always to treat the energies and forces you work with respect and caution. With great power comes great responsibility. You can modify and expand this system with additional crystals or altering the layout according to your specific needs and intentions. Maintain balance within the system to achieve optimal results.
