To create a potent hex-breaker curse, we must combine various elements, including obscure mystical symbols, ancient incantations, and cursed objects. This powerful counter-hex will dispel malicious forces responsible for misfortune, as well as providing long-lasting protection against any future malevolence.

Process for Creating the Hex-breaker:

1. **Gather the necessary items**:
   - A piece of parchment or heavy paper
   - Ink or charcoal for drawing symbols
   - A sacred space for casting the counter-hex
   - An obsidian mirror (as the cursed object)
   - The Selenite candle holder (for long-lasting protection)
   - A white or black candle
   - A deep understanding of the mystical symbols and incantations

2. **Draw the following obscure mystical symbols on the parchment**:
   - Vegv√≠sir (an Icelandic magical stave for guidance and protection)
   - Eye of Horus (an ancient Egyptian symbol for protection and health)
   - Bindrune (a combination of runic symbols, such as Algiz for protection and Gebo for balance)

3. **Create a sacred space by cleansing the area both physically and spiritually**:
   - Physically, sweep or clean the space
   - Spiritually, use a sage bundle to perform a smudging ritual, ensuring every corner of the space is purified
   
4. **Set up the objects within the sacred space**:
   - Place the obsidian mirror in the center
   - Surround the mirror with the parchment, symbols facing upward
   - Put the Selenite candle holder near the parchment and fix the candle in it

5. **Light the candle and recite the ancient incantation**:
   "Aterna rumina atarum, postae tenebrarum
    Custodis fatus, vincula exsolvere
    Benignus lux, mala bona dissipant
    Vinculum confringe, protegat nos hodie et omnibus diebus nostris."

(Translation: Shadows of the past, bringers of dark fate, 
               Guardians at the borders, break the chains,
               Benevolent light, dispel evil and bring good,
               Break the bond, protect us now and all our days.)

6. **Focus and visualize the hex being broken and protection being granted**:
   - Hold the obsidian mirror and gaze at the reflection of the flame
   - Close your eyes and visualize a beam of protective light enveloping yourself or the person affected by the hex
   - See the beam of light growing in strength and intensity, disrupting the malice of the curse and rendering it powerless

7. **End the ritual and dispose of the components**:
   - Snuff the candle and thank the divine for its assistance
   - Bury the parchment in a place far from the individual or space being protected
   - The obsidian mirror should be cleansed with salt or water before being used for any other purpose
   
By following this procedure, we create a potent hex-breaker curse that counters malevolent forces causing misfortune, ensuring long-lasting protection from ill-fate.
