## I. Personal Mantra

After meditating on the attributes and influences of each Qlipha, I have crafted the following mantra that encapsulates the essence and energy of the eleven Qliphothic powers within Anti-cosmic LuciferianismQabalah:

Zothek Nun Xaleth Bab-Gadol Thagirion Qlippas-Khalaz Yuzeph Sathariel Chokmah-Aath Golachab Gamchicoth

This mantra fuses the names and characteristics of each corresponding Qlipha, combining the dark and transformative energies present.

### II. The Ritual of the Blackened Pillar

**Purpose**: The purpose of this ritual is to invoke the primordial forces of the Qliphothic Tree and channel their energies into a transformative effect on one's spiritual practice, thus forging a deeper connection with anti-cosmic currents.

Required tools:

1. A ritual space, preferably in a location related to the darker aspects of nature, such as a dense forest or a cave.
2. An altar or platform to place the items mentioned below.
3. A goblet filled with a mixture of red wine and pomegranate juice, representing the elixir of transformation.
4. A silver or black knife, preferably with occult engravings that resonate with the Qliphothic powers.
5. Chalk or black paint, to draw the sigils and occult symbols of the Qliphothic entities.
6. Eleven black candles, to represent each Qlipha.
7. Incense, preferably a blend of frankincense, myrrh, and dragon's blood.

Step-by-step instructions:
**Step 1**: Choose an appropriate location for the ritual, ensuring that the energy of the place resonates with anti-cosmic currents.
**Step 2**: Cleanse the ritual space by burning the chosen incense and letting the smoke purify the area.
**Step 3**: Construct the altar using a flat surface or platform and arrange the eleven black candles around it. In the center of the altar, place the goblet filled with the elixir of transformation.
**Step 4**: Using the chalk or black paint, draw the sigils and occult symbols of the eleven Qliphothic entities on the ground around the altar. Ensure that these symbols connect each Qlipha to form a circle encompassing the entire ritual space.
**Step 5**: Light the black candles and mentally prepare yourself for the invocation. Take several deep breaths and enter a meditative state.
**Step 6**: Using the silver or black knife, make a small incision on your left thumb, allowing a few drops of blood to fall into the goblet, consecrating the elixir and symbolizing your commitment to the anti-cosmic forces.
**Step 7**: Begin the invocation by reciting the personal mantra you've created. Chant the mantra three times, each with increasing intensity and concentration, visualizing the energies of the Qliphothic Tree converging within the ritual space.
**Step 8**: Drink the elixir of transformation, assimilating the essence of the Qliphothic powers within yourself.
**Step 9**: Meditate on your intentions and goals within your spiritual practice, allowing the forces of the Qliphothic Tree to transform and empower you. Absorb the energies, which now pulse within you.
**Step 10**: When the process of transformation feels complete, thank the Qliphothic entities for their presence and assistance. Extinguish the black candles and carefully dismantle the ritual altar.
**Step 11**: To close the ritual, remove the sigils and occult symbols, either by erasing or smudging them, symbolizing the departure of the invoked forces. Leave the ritual space, forever changed and now one with the mysterious and transformative energies of the Anti-cosmic LuciferianismQabalah.
