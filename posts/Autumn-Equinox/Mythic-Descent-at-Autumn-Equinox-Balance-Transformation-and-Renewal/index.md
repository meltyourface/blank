The Autumn Equinox represents a time of balance between light and dark, when day and night are of equal length. It signifies the end of the harvest season and the beginning of the descent into the darker half of the year, a cycle that is mirrored in several mythological narratives that deal with deities descending into the Underworld. The symbolic relationship between the Autumn Equinox and the mythic descent of a deity into the Underworld is multifaceted, touching on themes of transformation, death and rebirth, balance, and the cyclical nature of existence. To better understand this relationship, we will explore the metaphysical and astrological aspects of both phenomena.

Metaphysical Aspects:
The mythic descent of a deity into the Underworld can be understood as a metaphor for the psychological, philosophical, and spiritual processes associated with the transformative powers of the dark half of the year. The dark and mysterious realm of the Underworld signifies the shadowy recesses of the human psyche, where hidden truths and unconscious desires dwell. As a deity descends into this metaphorical darkness, they often undergo a process of transformation or initiation, usually emerging as a more evolved, enlightened being, having integrated the darker aspects of their being.

For example, the Sumerian myth of Inanna, goddess of fertility, love, and war, follows her journey into the Underworld to visit her sister Ereshkigal. Inanna is stripped of her symbolic powers at each of the seven gates of the Underworld and is ultimately killed and hung on a hook to rot. Subsequently, she is resurrected, restores balance, and ascends back to the world of the living. This myth exemplifies the transformative power of the Autumn Equinox and the descent into darkness as a necessary step towards personal growth and enlightenment.

Astrological Aspects:
Astrologically, the Autumn Equinox is represented by the Sun's entrance into the sign of Libra, which is symbolized by the scales of balance and justice. This ingress highlights the theme of balance between light and dark, life and death, conscious and unconscious forces. The descent of a deity into the Underworld can be understood astrologically as a cosmic reflection of this equilibrium, as well as the natural process of change and growth experienced on Earth.

Furthermore, the Autumnal Equinox is associated with the planet Venus due to its rulership over the sign of Libra. Venus, as the archetype of beauty, love, and harmony, embodies the themes of balance, transformation, and unification of duality. Myths surrounding the cyclical descent and ascent of the Morning Star (Venus) parallel the narrative of a deity's journey into the Underworld, reflecting the transmutation of celestial phenomena into mythological narratives.

In conclusion, the symbolic relationship between the Autumn Equinox and the mythic descent of a deity into the Underworld is evident in the metaphysical and astrological dimensions of these events. Both the equinox and the descent signify a time of transformation, death, and rebirth, highlighting the essential and cyclical nature of existence. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of balance and integration of opposites, which is further mirrored in the astrological associations with Libra and Venus. Exploring these interconnected themes can provide initiates and students with invaluable insights into the enduring mysteries of life, death, and the eternal cycle of renewal.
