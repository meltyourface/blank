In order to understand the synthesis of the Hermetic Principles, Kabbalistic insights, and various alchemical processes to better comprehend the role of inner transformation and spiritual evolution within the adept's journey towards the Great Work, we ought to examine each of these teachings separately. Then, integrating these principles will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the esoteric tradition and personal growth within the occult sphere.

Hermetic Principles:
The Hermetic Principles are the core teachings of Hermeticism, a tradition of philosophic and spiritual wisdom attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. These principles consist of the following seven fundamental concepts:

1. Mentalism: All is mind, and the universe is mental in nature.
2. Correspondence: As above, so below; as below, so above. This pertains to the mirroring of different planes of existence.
3. Vibration: Everything is in motion, and all matter and energy vibrate at certain frequencies.
4. Polarity: Everything has opposites, and opposites are merely different aspects of the same thing.
5. Rhythm: Everything flows in cycles and patterns.
6. Cause and Effect: Every cause has its effect, and every effect has its cause.
7. Gender: Everything has masculine and feminine principles, and these principles interact in all aspects of life.

Kabbalistic Insights:
Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism that explores the divine nature, cosmology, and humanity's connection to the Divine. It primarily focuses on the Tree of Life, a diagrammatic representation of the ten Sephiroth, or emanations of God, as well as the 22 paths connecting them. Kabbalah invites adepts to engage with the spiritual world and seek divine wisdom and understanding.

Alchemical Processes:
Alchemy is an ancient philosophical and protoscientific practice concerned with transforming base materials into more noble substances, such as the fabled Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life. At its core, alchemy seeks the purification and transformation of both matter and spirit. There are three primary stages involved in the alchemical process: Nigredo (blackening), Albedo (whitening), and Rubedo (reddening). Nigredo denotes the initial stage of transformation through the decomposition of matter, Albedo represents the purification and spiritualization stage, and Rubedo symbolizes the final integration and rebirth.

**Synthesis**:
Now that we have an overview of the Hermetic Principles, Kabbalistic insights, and alchemical processes, we can synthesize these teachings to better comprehend the role of inner transformation and spiritual evolution within the adept's journey towards the Great Work.

The Great Work can be seen as a multilayered process of self-discovery, transformation, and spiritual evolution, which is a common objective in both Hermeticism and Alchemy. The Hermetic Principles act as a conceptual framework for understanding reality and oneself, while the Kabbalistic Tree of Life provides a practical roadmap for navigating the various stages of spiritual development.

By incorporating the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism and Kabbalistic teachings, adepts realize that understanding the divine nature of the universe within their own mind enables them to unlock the potential for spiritual evolution. Following the patterns of Correspondence and Vibration, adepts can see how the microcosm and macrocosm are interconnected, allowing for the transmutation of their spiritual and material nature through the alchemical processes.

**The journey of personal transformation can be likened to the alchemical stages**: Nigredo signifies the breakdown of the ego and old patterns; Albedo represents the purification of one's intentions and spiritual growth; and Rubedo denotes the integration of new wisdom, leading to the completion of the Great Work. Throughout this journey, adepts can utilize the Hermetic Principles, Kabbalistic insights, and alchemical processes as guides to achieving the fullest potential of their spiritual evolution.

In conclusion, synthesizing the Hermetic Principles, Kabbalistic insights, and alchemical processes allows adepts to better understand the role of inner transformation and spiritual evolution in their pursuit of the Great Work. By engaging with these teachings, individuals can engage in personal growth and development, refining their spiritual nature and attaining divine wisdom. The key themes throughout this synthesis include self-discovery, interconnectedness between the microcosm and macrocosm, and the cyclical nature of transformation and spiritual evolution.
