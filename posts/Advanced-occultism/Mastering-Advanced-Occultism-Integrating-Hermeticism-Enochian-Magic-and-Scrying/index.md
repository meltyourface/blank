The most indicative combination of practices and concepts for a holistic understanding and mastery in the context of advanced occultism is Hermeticism, Enochian magic, and conducting divination through scrying.

The reasoning behind this choice is that this combination touches upon various aspects of occultism and incorporates a more comprehensive approach. Hermeticism and Enochian magic are both highly sophisticated systems, each with their own history and development within the greater Western esoteric tradition. Meanwhile, divination through scrying represents a more direct and intuitive form of accessing information from the unseen realms.

Hermeticism has its roots in ancient Egypt and Greece and was later developed by medieval and Renaissance mystics and philosophers. Central to this tradition is the belief in the interconnectedness of all things, represented by the maxim "as above, so below." This idea emphasizes the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm and suggests that an understanding of the hidden patterns that govern the universe can empower the practitioner to create change in their own life and in the world around them. The study of Hermeticism involves pursuing knowledge about this interconnectedness through subjects such as alchemy, astrology, and sacred geometry.

Enochian magic, on the other hand, is a highly elaborate and structured system of angelic communication that was developed by the Elizabethan occultist John Dee and his psychic associate Edward Kelley in the late 16th century. The guiding concept behind Enochian magic is that the practitioner can establish contact with angels and celestial beings in order to access hidden knowledge. This requires a deep understanding of Enochian language, sigils, and ceremonies, making it an advanced and specialized area of occult study.

Finally, scrying is a form of divination in which the practitioner gazes into a reflective or translucent surface, such as a crystal ball, a mirror, or a bowl of water, in order to receive visions and messages from the spirit world. This practice engages the practitioner's intuition and psychic abilities to a greater extent than more structured systems like Tarot and requires a cultivated sense of focus and receptivity. Scrying provides a balance between the intellectual rigor of Hermeticism and Enochian magic and the intuitive and emotional aspects of spiritual practice.
