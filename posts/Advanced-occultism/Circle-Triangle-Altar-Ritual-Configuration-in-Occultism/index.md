- The practitioner within a circle of protection, the entity evoked within a triangle outside the circle, and the magical process symbolized by the tools and elements on the practitioner's altar

The relationship between the practitioner, the invoked entity, and the magical process can be best represented during a ritual by the configuration just mentioned. This is because this particular arrangement preserves the necessary separation and connection between all the involved forces.

In advanced occultism, rituals and invocations often involve the summoning of powerful spiritual entities. These entities can either aid the practitioner in achieving their goals or can prove to be malevolent if not properly handled. The circle of protection enclosing the practitioner serves as a safeguard from the possible negative influences of the invoked entity. It's a crucial element that has been utilized across different traditions and practices, including ceremonial magic, witchcraft, and various pagan paths.

The triangle is employed to contain the evoked entity. It can be seen as a space of manifestation where the entity is brought into the immediate vicinity of the practitioner. The triangle symbolizes the trinity – the macrocosm, microcosm, and the connecting bridge between those realms – embodying the chain of manifestation from the spiritual to the material plane.

The tools and elements on the practitioner's altar represent the magical process itself. Similar to how specific tools are utilized for particular tasks in mundane settings, each tool holds a symbolic significance corresponding to an operative aspect of the ritual. For instance, a wand might represent the will of the practitioner, while a chalice epitomizes the vessel through which the entity's influence flows. Further, the altar itself often depicts a microcosm comprising the various elements and objects that combine into a comprehensive depiction of the practitioner's magical universe.

Throughout history, practitioners from various traditions have employed different configurations to optimize the efficacy, safety, and control during their rituals. However, this specific setting wherein the practitioner, the entity, and the magical process occupy distinct yet interconnected spaces has stood the test of time and proved to be most effective. Not only does it provide adequate protection for the practitioner, but it also facilitates a powerful manifestation of the invoked forces while maintaining the necessary balance and harmony within the ritual.
