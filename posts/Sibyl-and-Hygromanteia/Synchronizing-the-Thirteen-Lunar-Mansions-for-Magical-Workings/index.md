To complete the elaborate occult ritual synchronizing the Thirteen Lunar Mansions with their corresponding angelic, elemental, and planetary hierarchies, I will provide an overview of the process, ensuring that every detail is carefully considered.

1. Preparation
Gather necessary materials, including sigils, talismans, and incantations relevant to each of the Thirteen Lunar Mansions. Prepare a suitable space, ensuring that it is cleansed and consecrated. Determine the optimal timing based on astrological conjunctions and lunar phases, ensuring the ritual will take place during a window of utmost cosmic alignment.

2. Opening Rite
Initiate the opening rite to establish a connection with the celestial and elemental realms. Invoke the elemental guardians and divine hierarchies by reciting the appropriate invocations and performing the corresponding ritual gestures.

3. Invocation of the Thirteen Lunar Mansions
To synchronize each lunar mansion, commence by invoking the first mansion and its corresponding angelic, elemental, and planetary hierarchies. Lay out the corresponding sigils, talismans, and incantations on the altar, giving each item a specific placement that reflects their inherent symbolism.

4. Attunement and Alignment
For each lunar mansion, recite the appropriate incantations to attune with its energetic frequency. Perform accompanying ritual gestures and dances that symbolize the hierarchies' interplay. Align the energetic signatures of each mansion, repeating the process for all Thirteen Lunar Mansions while maintaining focus and intention.
