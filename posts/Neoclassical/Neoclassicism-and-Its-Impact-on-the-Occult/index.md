## Neoclassical Influences within the Occult

Introduction

Neoclassicism, a dominating movement in art, literature, and architecture during the 18th and 19th centuries, has a rich and often-overlooked relationship with the occult. This section of the grimoire will provide insights into the key philosophical, artistic, and symbolic aspects of Neoclassicism, its impact on esoteric practices and rituals, and practical tips on how aspiring practitioners may integrate Neoclassical elements into their own magical studies. Additionally, notable Neoclassical occultists and their works will be highlighted to demonstrate the connection between Neoclassicism and the occult.

### I. Philosophical Foundations of Neoclassicism

Neoclassicism emerged as a response to the Enlightenment and the concurrent rise of rationalism, rebelling against both and seeking to revive the wisdom of the past, specifically drawing inspiration from ancient Greece and Rome. **Core principles of Neoclassicism include**:

1. ****Order and symmetry****: Neoclassicism favored structure, proportions, and harmony, inspired by principles of classical architecture and geometry.
2. ****Idealism****: Neoclassical artists and thinkers strived for perfection, emulating the ideals expressed in ancient myths and philosophies.
3. ****Virtue and moral clarity****: Neoclassicism emphasized the importance of virtue and moral principles in both personal and civic life, as opposed to the relativism that often accompanied Enlightenment thinking.

### II. Artistic and Symbolic Aspects of Neoclassicism

Neoclassical art and symbolism featured well-defined lines, a distinct hierarchy of forms, and mythological themes from ancient Greece and Rome. Moreover, these representations served as allegorical symbols expressing abstract concepts and values such as wisdom, heroism, and beauty. Occultists often employed these symbols and allegories to embody and communicate esoteric truths, enhancing the symbolic and mystical language of the occult.

### III. Neoclassicism's Impact on Esoteric Practices and Rituals

The Neoclassical period saw a resurgence of interest in ancient religious texts and mystical practices, which in turn influenced the esoteric practices of the time. Neoclassicism encouraged occultists to explore Greek and Roman mythology for spiritual meanings, delve into the works of Neo-Platonic philosophers for metaphysical insights, and study ancient rituals for magical inspiration.

Some of the Neoclassical influences on the occult include:

1. ****Revival of ancient magical practices****: Neoclassical occultists often sought inspiration from ancient rituals and spells, incorporating them into their magical work.
2. ****Alchemical transmutation****: The Neoclassical notion of turning base materials into gold mirrored the spiritual transformation that occurs in the process of personal growth and mystical enlightenment.
3. ****Symbolic synergy****: Neoclassicism provided a rich symbolic language that allowed occultists to express complex mystical ideas and narratives.

### IV. Integrating Neoclassical Elements into Occult Studies

To enhance your understanding and appreciation of the occult, consider incorporating the following Neoclassical concepts:

1. ****Studying Greek and Roman mythology****: Delve into the rich mythology of these ancient civilizations to explore the symbolic meanings and psychological archetypes therein. Reflect on how these mythological themes can be applied to your own magical practice.
2. ****Embracing Neoclassical aesthetics****: Incorporate Neoclassical art, architecture, and design into your ritual spaces to create an atmosphere that reflects the harmony, beauty, and wisdom of the Neoclassical ideals.
3. ****Considering ethical principles****: Reflect on Neoclassical ideals of virtue and moral clarity when making personal decisions in your magical practice and everyday life.

### V. Notable Neoclassical Occultists and Works

1. ****Éliphas Lévi****: A prominent 19th-century French occultist, Lévi's works drew heavily from Neoclassical symbolism, particularly in his seminal work "Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie," which depicted Neoclassical-inspired illustrations of the Tarot trumps.
2. ****The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn****: While incorporating various traditions, this influential late 19th-century magical society featured Neoclassical aesthetics in its ritual spaces, as well as Greek and Roman references in its teachings and practices.

Conclusion

The relationship between Neoclassicism and the occult is demonstrative of the reciprocal nature of artistic and philosophical movements and their impact on esoteric practices. By integrating Neoclassical elements and ideals into your magical studies, you can cultivate a deeper understanding and appreciation of the occult's historical dimensions and unlock new layers of mystical wisdom for exploration and growth.
