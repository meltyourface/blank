## Neoclassical Influences Within the Occult

Introduction

As we delve into the depths of mystique and extraordinary connections between various worldviews, we encounter a fascinating intersection between Neoclassicism and the occult. Neoclassicism arose in the 18th century as a movement within various artistic and intellectual fields such as literature, music, and visual arts, inspired by the ideals, aesthetics, and principles of ancient Greece and Rome. The exploration of the Neoclassical era and its impact on the occult allows us to better understand the development of esoteric philosophy, practices, and rituals, further enriching our knowledge of the subject.

1. Philosophical and Artistic Aspects of Neoclassicism

To grasp the Neoclassical influence on occult practices, it's essential to comprehend its philosophical and artistic foundations. Neoclassicism emerged as a response to the extravagance, grandiosity, and ornamentation of the Baroque and Rococo periods. This cultural shift was characterized by a renewed appreciation for simplicity, clarity, harmony, and order, which were considered virtues in the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. Proponents of Neoclassicism strove to adhere to classical principles such as balance, symmetry, and reason, rejecting excessive emotionalism and artistic excess.

2. Symbolic Aspects of Neoclassicism

The Neoclassical era was marked by an interest in symbolism borrowed from antiquity. Artists and thinkers drew on the rich iconography and mythology of ancient Greece and Rome to express ideals and convey complex ideas. These symbolic elements became deeply ingrained in esoteric studies as occultists sought to enhance their practices by incorporating Neoclassical imagery and symbolism.

3. Neoclassical Impacts on Esoteric Practices and Rituals

Neoclassical influence on esoteric practices primarily stems from its emphasis on order, structure, and harmony – qualities that align with the occult's appreciation for well-defined rituals, purposeful symbolism, and interconnected systems. Neoclassicism provided an ancestral framework to ground and contextualize esoteric practices, such as ceremonial magic, and its influences are evident in the works of numerous occultists. The desire for a structured environment led to the development of ritualized spaces and complex systems of correspondence – essential elements for effective magical practice.

4. Integrating Neoclassical Elements into Occult Studies

Individuals interested in incorporating Neoclassical elements into their occult studies can focus on the following approaches:

a. **Delve into mythology**: Study ancient Greek and Roman myths, paying special attention to their symbolism, allegorical meaning, and connections with archetypal figures and concepts within magical workings.

b. **Embrace aesthetic principles**: Decorate ritual spaces and select magical tools that reflect Neoclassical principles of simplicity, order, and harmony.

c. **Explore Neoclassical literature and art**: Reflect on the cultural and historical contexts, themes, and philosophical ideals that created the Neoclassical movement.

d. **Understand the role of correspondence systems**: Learn about the structure and interconnectedness of various aspects of magical practices through the lens of Neoclassicism, gaining deeper knowledge of the occult's underlying principles.

5. Notable Neoclassical Occultists and Works

The following are some examples of Neoclassical occultists and works that showcase the connection between these two worlds:

a. **Eliphas Lévi (1810-1875)**: A French occultist and influential figure in 19th-century occult revival, Lévi incorporated Neoclassical art and symbolism into his esoteric writings, particularly in his works “Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie” (Dogma and Ritual of High Magic) and “Histoire de la Magie” (History of Magic).

b. **William Blake (1757-1827)**: An English visionary artist, poet, and esoteric philosopher, Blake's work is marked by Neoclassical stylistic elements combined with mystical and symbolic imagery.

c. **The Tarot de Marseilles**: A significant tarot deck with a long history in esoteric tradition, the Tarot de Marseilles features Neoclassical design elements that were influenced by ancient Greco-Roman art and symbolism.

Conclusion

The Neoclassical era has left an indelible mark on the occult, with its philosophical, artistic, and symbolic aspects shaping esoteric practices and rituals. As we continue to uncover the threads that connect these seemingly disparate fields, we embark on a journey that enriches our understanding of the world and ourselves. By integrating Neoclassical elements into their own occult studies, individuals can delve deeper into the rich and complex tapestry of esoteric knowledge.
