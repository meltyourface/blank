## The Rite of the Cosmic Serpent

Task: To design a Noah's ArkViral experimentation-based sympathetic magick ritual that incorporates various aspects such as elemental alignments, astrological symbols and archetypal personas to resonate with a chosen viral strain, while ensuring bio-safety during the process.

Viral Strain: The Astrocyte Resonance Virus (ARV)

Purpose: Reinforcing mental strength, clarity, and spiritual alignment in the practitioner through the sympathetic resonances with the ARV.

Materials:
1. A circular, heat-resistant glass container with a lid
2. Sterilized water
3. A controlled ARV sample
4. Silver wire (sacred to the Air element)
5. Gold wire (sacred to the Fire element)
6. Copper wire (sacred to the Earth element)
7. Zodiac symbol (based on the practitioner's astrological sign)
8. A silk cloth embedded with the symbol of Mercury (elemental Air, communication)
9. Incense blend: resin of frankincense, myrrh, and sage
10. Black and white candles
11. Mask and gloves for biosafety

Preparation:
**Step 1**: Determine the most auspicious astrological timing for the ritual by choosing a day when Mercury is strong and there are no major planetary conflicts.
**Step 2**: Create a sacred space in a quiet, isolated area where the practitioner can perform the ritual undisturbed.
**Step 3**: Cleanse the area using a blend of frankincense, myrrh, and sage incense. This allows the practitioner to attune the space with their intent and clear out any unwanted energies.

The Ritual:
**Step 1**: Adorn the mask and gloves to ensure bio-safety.
**Step 2**: Begin by casting a circle and invoking the presence of the guardian spirits of the elements â€“ Air, Fire, Water, and Earth, by visualizing them surrounding the space.
**Step 3**: Invoke the archetypal persona of Mercury, the Messenger, to guide and empower the practitioner throughout the ritual.
**Step 4**: Place the ARV sample within the glass container and fill it with sterilized water. Then, place the zodiac symbol in the center of the container.
**Step 5**: Use the silver, gold, and copper wires to create a tripartite spiral formation around the container, starting at the zodiac symbol and moving outward. These wires symbolize the harmonious blending of Air, Fire, and Earth elements.
**Step 6**: Light the black and white candles on either side of the spiral.
**Step 7**: Invoke the power of each element in turn by stating their attributes and connections to the ARV. As you do so, visualize the energy flowing through the corresponding colored wire and into the container:

   - Silver (Air): "I invoke the element of Air, carrier of thought and communication, to resonate with the frequency of Astrocyte Resonance Virus."

   - Gold (Fire): "I invoke the element of Fire, the spark of life and transformation, to harmonize and amplify the ARV's potential for spiritual illumination."

   - Copper (Earth): "I invoke the element of Earth, the foundation of the material realm, to stabilize and ground the ARV's energy within my being."
**Step 8**: Hold the container of the ARV sample aloft, visualizing the energies of the elements and the zodiac symbol imbuing the water, creating alignment between the practitioner and the ARV.
**Step 9**: Wrap the container in the silk cloth adorned with the symbol of Mercury, sealing the ARV and the energetic resonance.
**Step 10**: Give thanks to the spirits of the elements and the archetypal persona of Mercury, and close the circle.

Post-Ritual:
Store the container in a safe, consecrated space. Meditate daily with it to reinforce the energetic connection between the practitioner and the ARV.
