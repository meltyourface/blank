Answer:

To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the background of the key figures and concepts involved. Aleister Crowley was an influential British occultist, known for developing the modern spiritual philosophy of Thelema. Jack Parsons was an American rocket engineer and a pioneer of early rocketry, as well as a dedicated practitioner of the occult. L. Ron Hubbard, on the other hand, was an American author who later founded the Church of Scientology, a religion that has attracted much controversy.

Thelema's Influence on Jack Parsons:

Jack Parsons was deeply influenced by the teachings of Aleister Crowley and Thelema. Parsons joined the Agape Lodge, a California-based branch of Crowley's mystical organization, Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), and eventually became the lodge's leader. Thelema, which is based on the idea that every individual has a True Will that they must discover and follow, appealed to Parsons, as it provided him with a powerful philosophical framework to merge his scientific ambitions with his occult pursuits.

Parsons often drew parallels between his rocketry research and the spiritual elevation sought by Thelemites. In his eyes, both were symbolic of the ascent to higher realms. Parsons considered himself an adept of Thelema and sought to enact Crowley's prophecies about the emergence of a new age. This led to an intense interest in sex magick and rituals designed to manifest the divine feminine or "Scarlet Woman."

Thelema's Influence on L. **Ron Hubbard**:

Thelema's influence on L. Ron Hubbard is more indirect and contentious. While he initially dabbled in occultism, Hubbard's primary link to Thelema came through his association with Parsons. Upon their meeting, Parsons was impressed by Hubbard's charisma, and the two became close friends. It's important to note that this friendship occurred several years before Hubbard's development of Scientology, and there is debate about whether any direct influence from Thelema can be found in the tenets of Scientology.

However, Hubbard's involvement in the Babalon Working ritual with Parsons demonstrates a certain level of interest in Thelemic ideas. Some researchers argue that Hubbard may have incorporated parts of Thelema into the foundations of Scientology, while others claim that any such similarities are superficial or coincidental.

The Babalon Working Ritual:

The Babalon Working was an elaborate ritual performed by Parsons and Hubbard in 1946, with the aim of invoking the divine feminine, referred to as Babalon or the Scarlet Woman. Parsons believed that successfully carrying out this ritual would lead to the birth of a child representing the incarnation of Babalon, bringing forth the new age of Thelema and hastening the realization of humanity's True Will. 

Their collaboration on the ritual can be seen as a meeting of mutual interests. For Parsons, Hubbard represented a capable magical partner who shared a passion for exploring the boundaries of the unknown. For Hubbard, the ritual presented an opportunity to gain insights and alleged paranormal abilities that could potentially be incorporated into his later work, including Scientology.

Key Themes and Conclusions:

- The influence of Aleister Crowley's Thelema on Jack Parsons was deeply intertwined with his life, career, and spiritual pursuits. Parsons saw Thelema as a framework for combining his scientific and mystical interests and actively worked to propagate its teachings.

- Thelema's influence on L. Ron Hubbard is more indirect and a matter of debate. While Hubbard was certainly intrigued by the occult and allied himself with Parsons, it is unclear how much of Thelema can be traced into Scientology's later development.

- The Babalon Working ritual represents a crucial juncture in the lives of both men. It testifies to Parsons' dedication to enacting Crowley's prophecies and illustrates Hubbard's willingness to experiment with esoteric ideas.

In conclusion, the underpinnings of Thelema, as well as its philosophical and occult concepts, were central to the lives and ambitions of both Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard. However, the impact and resonance of these ideas manifested differently in each individual. For Parsons, Thelema formed an integral part of his identity, while for Hubbard, it may have served as more of a stepping stone towards his later pursuits. Their collaboration on the Babalon Working ritual was undoubtedly a significant event, reflecting their mutual interests in transcending the boundaries of conventional reality.
