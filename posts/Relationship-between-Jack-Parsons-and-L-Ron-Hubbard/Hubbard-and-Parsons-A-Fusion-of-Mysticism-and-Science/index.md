The belief systems and ritual practices of the Church of Scientology and the occultism of Jack Parsons share some similarities due to the personal relationship between L. Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons. However, they differ significantly in terms of their core principles and methodologies. This analysis will delve into the intricacies of their personal relationship, examine the influence of their ideologies on one another, and explore the impact on the development of Scientology and Parsons' mystical pursuits.

Jack Parsons was a rocket scientist by profession but intensely interested in the occult and had strong ties to the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), an esoteric secret society. He was introduced to L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction author, in 1945. At the time, Parsons was heavily involved in the practices of sex magick, and Hubbard took an interest in these practices as well. This connection formed the basis of their personal relationship, which involved a shared interest in mysticism and the exploration of the human psyche.

The Church of Scientology's belief system, known as Dianetics, was founded by L. Ron Hubbard in 1952. The core principles are based on the idea that every individual possesses a reactive and analytical mind. The reactive mind stores traumatic memories, known as engrams, which cause psychological and emotional difficulties. Dianetics aims to erase these engrams via a process called auditing, which involves one individual, the auditor, guiding another, the preclear, through an introspective examination of their past.

Jack Parsons, on the other hand, adhered to the teachings of English occultist Aleister Crowley and was specifically involved with Thelema, a spiritual philosophy that emphasized the pursuit of one's true will. Thelema incorporates elements of magick, mysticism, and sex as a means to achieve personal transformation and reach higher states of consciousness.

Despite the different core principles, some similarities exist between Scientology and Parsons' occultism. Both focus on the individual's journey toward self-discovery and empowerment, as well as the exploration of hidden aspects of the human psyche. Additionally, both belief systems emphasize the importance of personal experience and self-determination.

However, there are key distinctions between the two. Dianetics is grounded in more of a pseudo-scientific approach, while Parsons' occultism leans heavily into mysticism and arcane rituals. Scientology is also structured as an organized religion with a hierarchical system, a stark contrast to the secretive societies and initiatory orders associated with Thelema and OTO.

In their personal relationship, both Hubbard and Parsons were known to have participated in occult rituals together, specifically the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to incarnate a divine feminine entity. Their collaborative efforts, though short-lived, would have influenced their mutual intellectual and spiritual development.

However, a notable dispute occurred between the two men when Hubbard absconded with Sara Northrup, Parsons' lover at the time, and a significant sum of Parsons' money. This event effectively severed their relationship.

In conclusion, the relationship between Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard had a profound impact on both men's ideologies and practices. While there are similarities in their shared interest in mysticism and human potential, the core principles and methodologies of the Church of Scientology and Parsons' occultism diverge significantly. Their brief collaboration and eventual rift would ultimately impact the development of Scientology and Parsons' mystical pursuits, creating two distinct and separate belief systems.
