Jack Parsons, a rocket engineer and a prominent figure in the realm of the occult, and L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, shared a complex relationship that has sparked intriguing theories and debates about Hubbard's mysterious background and the origins of Scientology. This analysis aims to disclose the possible influence of Hubbard's association with Parsons on the development of Scientology as a belief system and organization.

Parsons was a leading figure in the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis), an international occult organization which heavily relied on the philosophical and mystical doctrines of Aleister Crowley – the notorious English occultist. Parsons befriended Hubbard in 1945, and the two began collaborating on various occult pursuits, most notably the Babalon Working, a series of rituals aimed at invoking a divine feminine entity known as Babalon. Both were deeply invested in the power of ritual and magic to manifest their desires and improve their lives.

The key foundational principles of Scientology encompass the idea that an individual is a spiritual being called a "thetan" and that through a process called "auditing," one can reach a state of "Clear" where past traumas or negative experiences are erased, thus elevating one's spiritual potential and well-being. Several esoteric rituals, beliefs, and concepts shared between Parsons and Hubbard seem to align with these principles, suggesting possible connections and influences.

1. **The emphasis on self-discovery and personal transformation**: Both occult practices and Scientology value personal transformation and the power of the individual to overcome limitations and transcend their current state. Parsons' magical pursuits often aimed at invoking personal power and, similarly, Scientology's auditing process seeks to empower an individual by guiding them through a process of self-discovery and self-improvement.

2. **Ritualistic practices**: In his occult rituals, Parsons utilized symbols, invocations, and meditations designed to channel energies and achieve desired outcomes. Hubbard's development of Scientology's auditing process – a rigorous, step-by-step procedure involving the use of an "E-meter" device to locate and address past traumas – may have been influenced by his knowledge of and participation in rituals shared with Parsons.

3. **Symbolic elements**: Certain symbolic elements are found in both Parsons' occult practices and in Scientology. For example, the double triangle and the "S" symbol so often associated with Scientology may have been inspired by the unicursal hexagram and the "mark of the Beast" found in Crowley's teachings, from which Parsons heavily drew.

4. **Communication with higher entities**: Parsons and Hubbard frequently engaged in rituals which aimed to communicate with or invoke otherworldly beings. This is similar to Scientology's belief in thetans, ancient spirits that were said to have inhabited Earth millions of years ago. 

While the relationship between Parsons and Hubbard is indubitable, evaluating the extent and significance of his occult influences on the development and growth of Scientology remains a challenge. Despite the parallels and common themes discussed above, Scientology has since evolved into a global religious phenomenon, distinctly different from the esoteric practices shared with Hubbard's occult past. It is possible that Hubbard may have borrowed inspiration from his time with Parsons, but it appears that his ultimate vision for Scientology ultimately diverged from his occult associations.

In conclusion, while the relationship between Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard undoubtedly played a role in the development of Scientology, the extent of this influence is difficult to determine definitively. Deeper analysis into the esoteric underpinnings and connections between the two figures highlight intriguing parallels between their respective ideologies and practices. However, it is essential to recognize that Scientology has since evolved beyond Hubbard's early influences and is an independent belief system and organization in its own right.
