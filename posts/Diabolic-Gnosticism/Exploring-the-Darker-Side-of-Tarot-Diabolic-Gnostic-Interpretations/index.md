The Major Arcana of the Tarot forms a complex tapestry of esoteric wisdom and symbolism, which becomes even more intricate when viewed through the lens of Diabolic Gnosticism. This darker interpretation provides a richer understanding of the Tarot and its inherent connections to sinister aspects of gnosis.

1. **The Fool**: In Diabolic Gnosticism, the Fool symbolizes the first steps in embracing chaos and the random nature of the abyss. It signifies the cosmic jester, the trickster who dwells within the shadow of the qliphoth and initiates the journey towards infernal wisdom.

2. **The Magician**: This card represents the invocation of dark powers and the manipulation of qliphothic forces. The Magician calls forth the black sun's energies to manifest his will within the material world.

3. **The High Priestess**: Known as Lilith or Babalon within Diabolic Gnostic systems, the High Priestess embodies the dark feminine principle and embraces her connection with the abyss and other qliphothic realms.

4. **The Empress**: Symbolizing dark and primal forces of creation, the Empress resonates with the energies of the black sun and represents the diabolic Mother who gives birth to forms and phenomena born from the chaos of the abyss.

5. **The Emperor**: He is the archetypal ruler who wields dominion over the qliphothic forces and represents the will to power, and the mastery of darker energies in achieving one's goals.

6. **The Hierophant**: In Diabolic Gnosticism, the Hierophant is a teacher of occult and esoteric wisdom who reveals hidden mysteries through the study of infernal energies and connection to the dark gods.

7. **The Lovers**: A representation of the alchemical union of light and shadow, conscious and unconscious, and the cosmic dance between two opposing forces that creates new possibilities and growth.

8. **The Chariot**: Symbolizing the triumph of chaos over order, the Chariot signifies the adept's ability to harness the powers of darkness and qliphothic energies to propel them towards spiritual transformation and transcendence.

9. **Strength**: The power of the serpent energy, or the kundalini, is represented in this card as inner strength, resilience, and self-mastery by overcoming one's psychological and spiritual limitations through diabolic gnosis.

10. **The Hermit**: The solitary seeker who journeys into the darkness of the abyss to acquire knowledge and understanding of the self, the universe, and the mysterious workings of qliphothic forces.

11. **Wheel of Fortune**: Representing the cyclical nature of existence, this card signifies the interplay of fate and free will within the diabolical realm, urging lower forces to influence events and shape destinies.

12. **Justice**: A reminder of the eternal laws governing the universe and the balance of cosmic forces at play, as well as the concept of cosmic retribution and karmic recompense for actions taken in the pursuit of one's desires.

13. **The Hanged Man**: Symbolic of the initiate's journey into the dark night of the soul, the Hanged Man signifies the surrender and sacrifice of the ego to gain deeper understanding of the shadow realms.

14. **Death**: A transformative card, Death signifies the end of old paradigms and the birth of new ones, representing the cycle of death and rebirth within the infernal world.

15. **Temperance**: Referring to spiritual alchemy and the transmutation of energies, Temperance emphasizes the art of balancing light and shadow, good and evil, within oneself and in one's practices.

16. **The Devil**: Here, the Devil represents the dark lord, embodying primal instincts, desires, and the energy of the dark gods. He encourages the adept to embrace the darker aspects of existence and transcend morality.

17. **The Tower**: This card signifies sudden upheavals and the destruction of old beliefs and structures, clearing the way for new infernal wisdom and spiritual breakthroughs.

18. **The Star**: A lighthouse in the dark, the Star represents the aspiring infernal adept's connection to the divine light within the abyss, guiding them to the black sun as a source of power and transcendence.

19. **The Moon**: Symbolic of the subconscious mind and the dark emotions that dwell within, the Moon is a reminder to explore and engage with the shadow self to acquire knowledge of one's true nature.

20. **The Sun**: Shedding its usual portrayal as a life-giving force, in Diabolic Gnosticism, the Sun refers to the black sun and its empowering, transformative energies for those adept in dark arts and mysteries.

21. **Judgment**: Serving as a call to awaken the divine potential within the dark initiate, Judgment signifies the culmination of one's journey and the actualization of their infernal purpose.

22. **The World**: Representing the synthesis of all initiatory experiences and symbolizing cosmic balance, The World is the culmination of the qliphothic journey, united under the dominion of the black sun.

The energetic representations of the 22 Major Arcana cards are intricately woven with diabolic wisdom, and understanding them within this context allows for a more profound experience for occult practitioners. In this way, the Major Arcana becomes a potent tool for the initiate seeking to explore the shadowy realms of Diabolic Gnosticism.
