To begin constructing the astrological chart, we will need specific information about the date, time, and location of the founding ceremony for the new chapter of the Order of the Silver Star. For the purpose of this task, let's assume the following details:

Date: June 21, 2023
Time: 12:00 PM
Location: London, England

Given these details, we can now proceed to analyze the chart.

Rising Sign: Capricorn
Sun Sign: Gemini
Moon Sign: Scorpio

Notable aspects and placements include:

1. Sun in Gemini in the Sixth House: Indicates strong intellectual prowess, adaptability, and effective communication within the group. The chapter will likely thrive in areas of knowledge-sharing, creative problem-solving, and collaboration.

2. Moon in Scorpio in the Eleventh House: Suggests that there may be intense emotional bonds and powerful transformative experiences among chapter members. The chapter may have a profound impact on its members' lives, leading to deep personal growth and development.

3. Mars in Leo in the Eighth House: This placement can indicate a strong drive for power and dominance within the group. It highlights the need for leadership and direction but also potential conflicts and disagreements among members.

4. Pluto conjunct Ascendant: This aspect signifies a profound transformative power within the chapter. However, it can also indicate a sense of secrecy, hidden motives, and potential manipulation.

To ensure the success and longevity of the chapter, the following talismans, rituals, and practices are recommended:

1. Talisman: A lapis lazuli amulet will enhance communication, wisdom, and intellectual clarity. This can help amplify the strengths associated with Sun in Gemini and reduce potential misunderstandings or communication issues.

2. Ritual: Regular practice of a group meditation focused on unity, harmony, and shared goals will help mitigate the potential conflicts arising from Mars in Leo. Maintaining an emphasis on collaboration and diplomacy will further strengthen the chapter's bonds.

3. Practice: Encourage transparency and open communication within the group to address the secretive nature indicated by Pluto conjunct Ascendant. As leaders or influencers within the chapter, ensure that you are approachable and foster a culture of trust.

4. Protective Charm: Utilizing a smoky quartz crystal for grounding and protection during rituals and group gatherings will offer protection from potential negative influences, both internal and external.

By focusing on these recommendations, the new chapter of the Order of the Silver Star will be empowered to face its challenges head-on, leading to eventual success, prosperity, and longevity within the organization.
