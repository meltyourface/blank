To thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the cornerstone concepts of the Order of the Silver Star's spiritual teachings. These key aspects include True Will, Crowley's Thelema philosophy, and the concept of polarity. We shall explore how these components interconnect, enabling personal and collective evolution.

1. **True Will**
True Will refers to the innermost nature of an individual, the purpose that drives them, and the authentic expression of their being. According to the Order of the Silver Star, once a person discovers and aligns with their True Will, they can work towards spiritual growth and self-realization.

2. Crowley's Thelema Philosophy
Thelema is a spiritual philosophy founded by Aleister Crowley, who is also associated with the Order of the Silver Star. The core principle of Thelema is the concept of "Do what thou wilt," emphasizing an individual's right to pursue their True Will. This belief system supports personal freedom and the attainment of one's ultimate potential.

3. **Concept of Polarity**
The concept of polarity holds that there are complementary forces in the universe that work together for a greater purpose. In many spiritual traditions, this is often described as the balance between masculine and feminine energies. Polarity encourages the acceptance and integration of contrasting elements, fostering dynamic evolution and growth.

Now let's examine the interconnections between these key aspects:

True Will and Thelema Philosophy
Thelema philosophy is inherently tied to the concept of True Will, as it prompts adherents to pursue their deepest desires and assert their individual autonomy. By discovering and following one's True Will, a person aligns with the philosophical tenets of Thelema, embarking on a journey towards spiritual fulfillment and personal evolution.

Polarity and True Will
The integration of polar forces shapes a person's journey towards discovering their True Will. By recognizing, embracing, and balancing the contrasting aspects of one's self, an individual can harmonize the energies within them and align with their True Will more effectively. The process of balancing polarity also helps one develop a clearer understanding of their purpose and strengths.

Polarity and Thelema Philosophy
The Thelema philosophy also embraces the concept of polarity, with its embracing of both "light" and "dark" aspects of human nature. By accepting and integrating polar forces, Thelemites can experience enhanced personal freedom and growth, allowing them to better embody the ideals of Thelema and follow their True Will.

In conclusion, the key aspects of the Order of the Silver Star's spiritual teachings – True Will, Crowley's Thelema philosophy, and the concept of polarity – are intricately interconnected in promoting both personal and collective evolution. By understanding and embracing one's True Will, adhering to the core principles of Thelema, and integrating polarities within oneself, individuals can attain greater spiritual fulfillment and operate in harmony with the universe. This collective alignment contributes to the overarching evolution and advancement of humanity, allowing us to reach our highest potential.
