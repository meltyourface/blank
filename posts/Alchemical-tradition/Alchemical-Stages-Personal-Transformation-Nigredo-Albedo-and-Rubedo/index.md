To respond to this knowledge challenge, it is essential to explore the three primary stages of the Magnum Opus in alchemy (nigredo, albedo, and rubedo) and analyze how they connect with the personal transformation process. We will also examine the role of elements, planetary aspects, and archetypal meanings within each stage and infer a deeper understanding of these correlations. 

1. **Nigredo (The Blackening)**:
Nigredo, also known as the blackening, is the initial stage of the Magnum Opus in alchemy. This stage is characterized by the decay and putrefaction of the initial substance, symbolizing death, darkness, and breaking down. 

In terms of personal transformation, nigredo can be seen as the stage of complete loss, devastation, and coming face-to-face with one's shadow-self. In essence, it involves confronting one's darker aspects, doubts, and fears. During this process, there is a purging of what does not serve the individual, paving the way for regeneration and renewal.

In regards to elemental correspondence, nigredo is associated with the element of earth, symbolizing stability, grounding, and foundation. The planet Saturn represents this stage, whose archetypal themes include discipline, transformation, restrictions, and crystallization.

2. **Albedo (The Whitening)**:
The second stage in the Magnum Opus is albedo, also referred to as the whitening. This stage signifies purification, washing away impurities, and achieving the purification of the alchemical substance.

In a personal transformative context, this phase can be understood as the purification and cleansing of thoughts, emotions, and beliefs that have been ingrained in a person's psyche. It is a period of rediscovery, where the individual strives for self-awareness, inner peace, and a new spiritual understanding of their life's purpose.

The element associated with albedo is water, symbolizing the washing away and purifying process intrinsic to this stage. The planet aligned with albedo is the Moon, which represents the archetypal feminine, intuition, and nurturance. 

3. **Rubedo (The Reddening)**:
The final stage of the Magnum Opus is rubedo, or the reddening. This is the phase where the alchemical process reaches completion and results in the Philosopher's Stone, an item capable of achieving enlightenment and immortality.

From a personal transformation standpoint, rubedo represents the realization and integration of one's true self. The individual unites the experiences of the previous stages and attains a profound level of understanding, enlightenment, and spiritual growth.

In the elemental context, rubedo is associated with fire, representing passion, transformation, and power. The corresponding planet is Mars, which embodies the archetypal masculine, energy, and action.

In summary, the three main stages of the Magnum Opus, namely nigredo, albedo, and rubedo, exhibit strong correlations with the personal transformative process. Nigredo signifies the confrontation and purging of the darker aspects of oneself, albedo symbolizes purification and self-awareness, and rubedo embodies enlightenment, self-realization, and spiritual growth. Throughout these stages, the interplay of elements, planetary aspects, and archetypal meanings further enriches the symbolism offering a profound understanding of the Magnum Opus and its connection to personal transformation.
