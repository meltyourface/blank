The Western alchemical tradition, a complex and arcane field of study, has been significantly influenced by contributions from both Islamic and Jewish alchemy. To fully appreciate the roots of Western alchemy, it is essential to explore the pivotal texts, influential philosophers, and cross-cultural transmission of knowledge that these two traditions facilitated. The impact of these contributions is profound, as they engendered new alchemical symbols, refined metallurgical techniques, and facilitated the fusion of philosophical concepts.

One of the most influential figures in the history of alchemy was the Islamic philosopher, Geber, also known as Jabir ibn Hayyan. His monumental work, "The Seventy Books," laid the groundwork for understanding the nature of metals and the process of transmutation. This collection of writings not only introduced new chemical substances, but also presented critical techniques such as distillation, crystallization, and sublimation. Geber's profound influence on Western alchemy extended beyond his innovations in the alchemical laboratory, as he also developed an elaborate system of spiritual and esoteric correspondences within the alchemical process.

Besides the practical aspect, Islamic alchemy also brought philosophical ideas that merged with alchemical thought. Al-Razi, another influential Islamic alchemist and philosopher, incorporated Neoplatonic ideas into the field, harmoniously blending metaphysical and material aspects of alchemy. This blend helped to transform alchemy into a more comprehensive process, incorporating both the physical and the metaphysical.

Jewish alchemy played a considerable role in shaping the Western alchemical tradition. Influential texts such as the "Bahir" and the "Zohar," essential works in the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah, provided important insights into the nature of the divine and the hidden structure of the universe. These texts complemented the Hermetic philosophy which also significantly influenced Western alchemy. By incorporating Kabbalistic ideas alongside Hermetic ones, the Western alchemical tradition became an intricate tapestry of mystical and alchemical thought.

The cross-cultural transmission of knowledge facilitated by trade, the rise of universities, and the patronage of intellectual pursuits by powerful rulers, allowed Islamic and Jewish alchemists to collaborate with their Christian counterparts actively. This collaboration led to the creation of new alchemical symbols, and the dissemination of alchemical manuscripts across Europe, as alchemists sought to encode their knowledge in an arcane language that would simultaneously conceal and reveal the secret nature of their art.

The impact of Islamic and Jewish alchemy on Western alchemical practices is difficult to overstate. The creation of new alchemical symbols, the refinement of metallurgical techniques, and the fusion of philosophical concepts lead to a profound understanding of the spiritual, philosophical, and material aspects of the universe, as seen through the lens of alchemy. By studying the influence of Geber and other key figures like Al-Razi, and the incorporation of Kabbalistic ideas, it becomes evident that the Western alchemical tradition would not have evolved into the rich and complex field it is today without the crucial contributions of both Islamic and Jewish alchemy.
