  In the context of spiritual evolution and the Magnum Opus, the alchemical process is a metaphorical journey describing the transformation of the self, reflecting self-improvement, personal growth, and enlightenment. This process can be divided into various stages, primarily represented by colors, each entailing a specific meaning, symbolism, and associated mythical creatures. In this response, we will explore each stage along with the related symbolism and mythical creature connections.
  
  1. **Nigredo (Blackening)**: 
  The Nigredo stage, symbolized by black color, is the beginning of the journey. It represents the decomposition and purification of the matter, or the primal chaos, during which the self must confront its shadow and release suppressed memories or traumas. It is associated with the element earth, which is rooted and stable. The raven or crow is the mythical creature linked with Nigredo, symbolizing the destruction and transformation of the ego.
  
  2. **Albedo (Whitening)**: 
  The Albedo stage, illustrated with the white color, represents purification, cleansing, and rebirth. In this phase, the spiritual practitioner seeks purity of the soul by engaging in introspection, meditation, and the dissolution of the ego. It is related to the element water, responsible for emotional wisdom and intuition. The mythical creature associated with the Albedo stage is the swan, which embodies grace and the ability to navigate through the tumultuous subconscious waters.
  
  3. **Citrinitas (Yellowing)**: 
  In the Citrinitas stage, represented by the color yellow, the focus is on the awakening of intellect and enlightenment. The individual begins to integrate their healed and purified self with their newfound wisdom and understanding. The element air is connected to this phase, signifying learning, communication, and detachment from previous limiting beliefs. The mythical creature associated with Citrinitas is the Phoenix, symbolizing the continuous cycle of death and rebirth, as well as the transformation from darkness into light.
  
  4. **Rubedo (Reddening)**: 
  The Rubedo stage, symbolized by the color red, is the final stage of the alchemical process, signifying the creation of the Philosopher's Stone or the ultimate state of enlightenment. It represents the unification of all the aspects of the self, embodying wisdom, love, and power. In this stage, the spiritual practitioner has achieved self-mastery, inner peace, and a deep understanding of existence. The element fire is associated with this stage, representing the transformative power of the Magnum Opus. The mythical creature linked to Rubedo is the Red Lion, a powerful figure demonstrating courage, passion, and the victory of spirit over matter.
  
  In summary, the alchemical process of spiritual evolution and the Magnum Opus is divided into four main stages: Nigredo (Blackening), Albedo (Whitening), Citrinitas (Yellowing), and Rubedo (Reddening). Each stage represents a specific transformation, from facing darkness and cleansing the soul to intellectual awakening and attaining self-mastery. Each stage is symbolically connected to a color and a mythical creature, further enhancing the meaning and philosophical depth of the process.
