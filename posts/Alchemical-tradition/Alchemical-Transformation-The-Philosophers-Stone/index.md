The answer is Philosopher's Stone.

In the context of alchemical tradition, the Philosopher's Stone represents the process of transformation and deepened understanding, and it can be associated with the three aspects: Mercury, Quintessence, and the concept of "Solve et Coagula."

The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance, allegedly capable of turning base metals into gold and bestowing eternal youth through a concoction called the Elixir of Life. It symbolizes the highest state of enlightenment and transformation in alchemical terms.

Mercury, one of the three aspects mentioned, is known as the "spirit" in alchemical parlance, represents fluidity, and is associated with transmutation. Alchemists believed that the combination of Mercury and Sulfur provided the basis for the creation of metals. Therefore, it played a significant role in the formulation of the Philosopher's Stone.

Quintessence, the second aspect, refers to the fifth element or unattainable, which, according to alchemists, permeates all of nature. It was thought to be the essential essence or spiritual component of a substance that gives it its unique qualities. The quest to discover the Quintessence was essentially the pursuit of the knowledge of the Philosopher's Stone.

"Solve et Coagula" is a Latin maxim that means "dissolve and coagulate." It signifies the process of breaking down elements, purifying, and recombining them in a new and perfected form. This principle is central to alchemical theory, particularly in the creation of the Philosopher's Stone. In order to achieve perfection, alchemists believed that components had to be separated, cleansed, and then reunited into a more sophisticated product.

The Philosopher's Stone, therefore, is the best symbol among the given options for the process of transformation and the deepened understanding sought by alchemists. **It represents the ultimate goal in alchemical practices and connects all three aspects mentioned**: Mercury, Quintessence, and the principle of "Solve et Coagula."
