Queen Elizabeth I and Saint Joan of Arc: A merging of political influence with the divine connection to victory in battle.

This pairing best represents the synthesis of roles and powers between queens, princesses, and saints, as it combines the political authority of Queen Elizabeth I with the divine connection and guidance in battle attributed to Saint Joan of Arc. 

Queen Elizabeth I of England was an influential monarch who successfully navigated a male-dominated political landscape. She skillfully managed domestic and international affairs, and her reign was characterized by a significant expansion of the arts and culture, innovation, and architectural grandeur. As a queen, she wields power and influence over her subjects and is seen as a major figure in the higher echelons of society.

Saint Joan of Arc, on the other hand, was a French héroïne who believed that she received divine visions and guidance from God during the Hundred Years' War against England. As a result, she led the French army in several important victories before being captured, tried, and burned at the stake for heresy. This made her a martyr and a powerful symbol of French resistance against the English. She was later canonized as a saint due to her steadfast faith and divine connections.

The synthesis of Queen Elizabeth I and Saint Joan of Arc represents a blending of political influence and divine connection in the realm of occult study. Theirs was a powerful fusion because it combined the earthly power of a queen with the spiritual connection attributed to a saint. This relationship can be interpreted as an example of the divine feminine, combining capabilities and qualities that are both earthly and beyond this world.

By pairing the characteristics and strengths of a queen like Elizabeth with the abilities and faith of a saint like Joan, a rare and powerful union is formed that demonstrates the potential influence of women in spiritual and political realms. Such a bond, when truly understood and harnessed, represents not only a synthesis of roles and powers, but also a force which transcends worldly limitations and merges the mundane with the metaphysical.
