These revered women also play significant roles in spell-casting for various purposes. Appealing to powerful saints like St. Brigid, the patroness of witches, blacksmiths, and firefighters, brings protection and guidance. Furthermore, practitioners can petition these spiritual figures to enhance their magical abilities, such as invoking the blessings of St. Hildegard von Bingen, the patroness of mystics and herbalists, for wisdom in herbal healing.
