To fully understand and appreciate the roles of Queen Sheba, Saint Dymphna, and Princess Mandane in the contexts of wisdom, healing, and spirituality, it is important first to provide a brief background and history of each of these figures.

Queen Sheba, also known as Queen of Sheba, is a legendary figure mentioned in religious texts such as the Bible, the Quran, and Ethiopian Jewish scriptures called the Kebra Nagast. She is believed to have been a wise and beautiful queen from the kingdom of Sheba, which is thought to be in modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia. Queen Sheba is famous for her visit to King Solomon in Jerusalem to test his wisdom by posing complex riddles and questions.

Saint Dymphna, a Christian martyr and the patron saint of mental illness, lived during the 7th century in Ireland. She was the daughter of a pagan Irish chief, and after being baptized, she devoted herself to the virginal religious life. When her mother died, her father, driven by grief, wanted to marry Dymphna because of her resemblance to her mother. To escape this fate, Dymphna fled to Belgium, where she continued her works of charity and healing. Her father eventually found her, and when she refused his demand to return and marry him, he beheaded her.

Princess Mandane, a noteworthy figure in ancient Persian history, was the mother of the famous Persian King, Cyrus the Great. She was a Median princess and the daughter of King Astyages. Princess Mandane is not as well-known as Queen Sheba or Saint Dymphna, but she played a pivotal role in shaping her son's life and kingship. 

Now that we have established the historical backgrounds of these three figures let us delve into their roles in the contexts of wisdom, healing, and spirituality.

**Wisdom**: Queen Sheba's experience in testing the wisdom of King Solomon is the epitome of her connection to divine or esoteric knowledge. By posing complex questions and riddles, she sought to discriminate Solomon's true wisdom from mere intellectual knowledge. She symbolizes the search for divine wisdom, unity with the divine, and the importance of intellectual development. In comparison, Saint Dymphna's wisdom lay in understanding the need for a devout religious life and following her spiritual beliefs, despite personal hardships. Princess Mandane's wisdom was mainly displayed in her guidance of her son, Cyrus the Great, to be a just and compassionate ruler.

**Healing**: Saint Dymphna's primary association with healing comes from her work as a patron saint for mental illness. By devoting herself to charity and helping those struggling with their mental health, she not only healed their physical conditions but also touched their souls on a deeper, spiritual level. Queen Sheba and Princess Mandane did not have explicit associations with healing, but their pursuits and influence can be seen as having a transformative impact on society that could bring about healing in a broader, metaphorical sense.

**Spirituality**: Both Queen Sheba and Saint Dymphna are deeply associated with spirituality. Queen Sheba's quest for wisdom and her interest in the divine represent her spiritual inclinations. Saint Dymphna's connection to spirituality is more direct, as a Christian saint with a story tied to her piety and religious devotion. Princess Mandane, while not as heavily associated with spirituality as the other two figures, nevertheless helped shape Persian religion and spirituality through her influence on Cyrus the Great.

In conclusion, the roles of Queen Sheba, Saint Dymphna, and Princess Mandane in wisdom, healing, and spirituality are varied and interconnected. Queen Sheba sought divine wisdom, Saint Dymphna devoted herself to religious life and healing, and Princess Mandane played an influential role in shaping the future of her kingdom. These figures demonstrate that knowledge, healing, and spirituality are important aspects of human life that can manifest in unique and profound ways.
