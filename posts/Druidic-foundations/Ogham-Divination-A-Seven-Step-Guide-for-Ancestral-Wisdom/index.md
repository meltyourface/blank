Step 1: Gathering and Consecration of Sacred Woods

Begin the process during the specific lunar cycle associated with the tree you wish to gather for the ogham staves. First, perform a grounding and centering meditation to attune yourself to the energies of nature. Once centered, seek out a healthy, mature tree of the desired wood type and respectfully ask permission from the tree's spirit to take a branch for your ogham staves. If you feel a positive response, give thanks and use a ritual knife to remove a small branch with care and precision. Upon returning home, cleanse and consecrate the branch through a purification ritual involving the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water).

Step 2: Carving the Ogham Symbols

Using a sharp carving tool, carefully inscribe each of the twenty ogham symbols onto separate staves, ensuring the symbols are equally spaced and deeply etched. As you carve each symbol, focus on its associated tree, lunar cycle, and elemental energy to imbue each stave with the distinct essence of its respective ogham character.

Step 3: Preparing for Divination

Select a quiet, sacred space for the divination session. Arrange a cloth on the ground or altar to represent the earth element, and place a bowl of water, a lit candle, and a feather or incense on the cloth to symbolize the remaining elements.

Step 4: The Ogham Spread

One common layout for ogham divination is the Three Stave Spread, which represents the past, present, and future. Holding the ogham staves in both hands, ask your question aloud or silently. Close your eyes and mix the staves, praying to the Druidic ancestors for guidance as you randomly select three staves.

Step 5: Interpreting the Ogham Characters

Place the first stave on the left side of the cloth, representing the past. Position the second stave in the center for the present, and the third on the right for the future. Study the ogham symbols on each stave and apply their unique meanings and elemental associations to the context of your question, focusing on how the past, present, and future intertwine to reveal guidance and insights.

Step 6: Invoking Druidic Ancestors

To deepen the divination experience, perform an ancestor invocation. Light a candle and incense, then call upon the spirits of Druidic ancestors, inviting them to be present and guide you in interpreting the ogham staves. Say a prayer or poetic invocation that resonates with you and acknowledges their wisdom and expertise. Remain receptive to any intuitive messages imparted during the divination session, and thank the ancestors for their guidance before formally closing the ritual.

Step 7: Closing the Ritual

Once you have concluded the divination session, express gratitude to the ogham staves, the elements, and the ancestors for their assistance. Safely snuff the candle and incense, and return the ogham staves to their storage pouch or box.

By following these steps, a comprehensive Druidic divination method using ogham staves can be effectively implemented to honor ancient practices, deepen your connection to the Celtic tree calendar, and invoke the wisdom of the Druidic ancestors.
