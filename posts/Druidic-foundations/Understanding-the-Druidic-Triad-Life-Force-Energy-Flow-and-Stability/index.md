To respond to this knowledge challenge thoroughly, let us first understand each of the three essential elements of the Druidic triad and then discuss their correspondence with the interconnectedness of the natural world, dimensions of existence, and individual spiritual development within the context of cosmic harmony and balance. 

Nwyfre, Gwyar, and Calas are often considered the three essential elements in the Druidic framework. These elements, or principles, affect not only physical realms but also deeper aspects such as human consciousness, spirituality, and the forces of nature.

1. Nwyfre (Life Force)
Nwyfre represents the life force or vital energy present in all living things. In several spiritual and esoteric traditions, this concept is called prana, chi, or qi. Nwyfre is a subtle energy that flows through every living being, connecting them to each other and to the natural world.

2. Gwyar (Flow of Energy)
Gwyar signifies the flow of energy, movement, and change. It represents the cycles of life, such as birth, growth, death, and rebirth, as well as the fluctuating nature of emotions and thoughts. Gwyar is associated with the principle of fluidity and adaptability, which is essential for maintaining balance and harmony in life processes.

3. Calas (Stability)
Calas represents stability, structure, and grounding force. Calas enables the manifestation of physical reality and provides a framework for life to exist. It relates to the material world and the constant interplay between order and chaos.

Now, let us delve into how these three elements correspond to the interconnectedness of the natural world, dimensions of existence, and individual spiritual development within the context of cosmic harmony and balance.

Interconnectedness of the Natural World:
The natural world is an intricate system where all elements are interconnected in a delicate balance. Nwyfre energizes the entire process and brings life to the ecosystem. Gwyar represents the dynamics in nature, like the changing seasons, the water cycle, and the constant flow of energy that sustains life. Calas provides the stability and foundation for the natural world to exist and maintain its structure.

Various Dimensions of Existence:
In Druidic cosmology, there is an understanding that multiple realms or dimensions of existence coexist, such as the physical, subtle, and spiritual planes. Nwyfre is the life force that permeates all dimensions, connecting them and ensuring their interdependence. Gwyar governs the interaction and transformation between both subtle and physical realms. Calas establishes the underlying structure of these dimensions, maintaining their coherence and integrity.

Individual Spiritual Development:
Within the greater context of cosmic harmony and balance, individuals embark on their spiritual journeys to understand, grow, and evolve. Nwyfre facilitates personal transformation since it sparks the inner vitality needed to explore and venture into spiritual realms. Gwyar reflects the continuous process of growth and refinement, embracing change and the ongoing pursuit of wisdom. Calas is the grounding element, providing stability and anchoring the individual to their sense of purpose and inner truth.

In conclusion, the three essential elements of the Druidic triad - Nwyfre, Gwyar, and Calas - correspond to the interconnectedness of the natural world, various dimensions of existence, and the spiritual development of individuals by representing the life force, flow of energy, and stability that are crucial for maintaining cosmic harmony and balance. By understanding these fundamental principles, one can gain a deeper insight into the intricacies of existence and the importance of balance in both the spiritual and material realms.
