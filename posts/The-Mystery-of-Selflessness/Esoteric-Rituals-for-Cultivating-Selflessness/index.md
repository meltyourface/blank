## I. Preparation for the Rituals

Before engaging in any of the following esoteric rituals and occult-derived invocations, adhere to the following preparatory recommendations:

A. **Diet**: Maintain a clean, plant-based diet, avoiding excessively processed or artificially produced foods. Fasting for a short period before the rituals can also help cleanse the body and mind.

B. **Meditation**: Engage in daily meditation sessions, focusing on breath and mindfulness to quiet the mind and foster a heightened level of spiritual awareness.

C. **Mindset**: Adopt a humble attitude, releasing attachment to the ego and any self-centered desires to enable a smooth entry into the realm of selflessness.

### II. Rituals and Invocations

1. **The Labyrinth of Ego Dissolution**

A. Design a labyrinth using sacred geometry principles, emphasizing intricate patterns to represent the complex journey of self-transformation.

B. **Begin at the entrance and recite the following mantra**: "Om aham prema, om aham karuna" (I am love, I am compassion).

C. As you walk the labyrinth, visualize metaphorically shedding layers of ego with each step. Upon reaching the center, experience a state of pure selflessness.

D. Retrace your steps while reciting the mantra, absorbing the energy of selflessness back into your being.

2. **The Seven Chakra Harmonization**

A. Sit in a comfortable position, maintaining a straight spine. Close your eyes and bring awareness to your breath.

B. Begin by focusing on the Root Chakra, located at the base of the spine, and cultivate feelings of safety and grounding. Visualize a red glowing ball of energy expanding from that point.

C. **Repeat this process through the remaining chakras using the following correspondences**:

   - Sacral (orange, relationships and creativity)
   - Solar Plexus (yellow, personal power and will)
   - Heart (green, love and compassion)
   - Throat (blue, communication)
   - Third Eye (indigo, intuition and insight)
   - Crown (violet, divine connection)

D. As each chakra is balanced and empowered, recite the mantra "Om aham sharanam gacchami" (I take refuge in selflessness) at each energy center, thus creating a harmonious connection with the Mystery of Selflessness.

3. **The Elemental Communion**

A. Arrange four sacred tools corresponding to the elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water) on an altar (e.g., crystal for Earth, incense for Air, candle for Fire, a bowl of water for Water). Suspend a pentagram, symbolizing the interconnectedness of all five elements (in this case, the fifth being Spirit), above the altar.

B. Stand before the altar and bring your hands into Anjali Mudra (prayer position) at the heart, invoking the spiritual connection through each element.

C. Offer a gesture of gratitude to each element, acknowledging their role in cultivating selflessness and spiritual growth. As you do this, recite: "Om deva tatva samyukta" (In communion with the divine elements).

D. Close the ritual by allowing the energies of the elements to harmonize and assist you in your journey towards selflessness.

4. **The Path of Service and Compassion**

A. In your daily life, practice acts of kindness and compassion towards others without seeking personal gain or recognition.

B. For each act of service, consider it an offering to the divine and to the greater good, fostering a deep sense of connection with others and genuine selflessness.

C. At the end of each day, meditate on the acts of kindness performed and recite: "Om aham seva param dharma" (My supreme duty is selfless service).

By engaging in these rituals and invocations regularly, you will deepen your immersion into The Mystery of Selflessness and foster a more profound spiritual connection.
