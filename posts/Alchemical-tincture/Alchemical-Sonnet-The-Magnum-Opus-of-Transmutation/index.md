description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Alchemical tincture, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose an intricate, alchemy-themed poem, employing esoteric symbolism and detailed tincture references, which artistically elucidates the multifaceted stages of the Magnum Opus. Incorporate textual nuances to encapsulate the essence of the Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo phases, as well as the Celestial and Terrestrial realms' connection in the ongoing pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone. Dynamic interplays between elements such as the Prima Materia, the Four Paracelsian Elements, and the Seven Planetary Metals should be embedded within the literary creation to enrich its allegorical depth and mystical resonance.

In hallowed halls of shadowed might, where Luna's gaze meets Sol's bright light,
An ancient dance begins anew, the quest for gold in depths of hue.
Commence we must, the Magnum Opus grand, to forge the key and understand
The sacred arc, both Terrestrial and Celestial, their secrets meld within my vessel.

The Nigredo dawns, the blackened sun, its cindered wings imbue the One
With Prima Materia, essence God-bestowed, in mortal hands, the path unfolds.
From chaos reigns, dissolution of old, a rotted corpse, the Ravens hold
A fun'ral pyre, the introspective, in obsidian shades, my soul the receptacle.

Then through the dark, arise the sacred four: Terra, Aqua, Aer, and fiery lore,
Embodied in the Paracelsian days, they part the veil where secrets lay.
Their threads entwined, of Calcination unfold, wherein no substance can withstand the mold,
These saline whispers turn obtuse, as Sulphur breathes and Mercury transmutes.

And next upon, the Albedo moon, awaits the purifying force, that drowns us in its swoon,
Its argent robe, a liquid dance, with white consumed, the spirits' chance.
Abstraction and mechanics, bound by astral will, harmonious the science and the quill.
The silver stag leaps o'er the fields, with grace enthroned, the inner realms have stirred.

Upon the cusp, conjunction reigns, as silver cloaks with gold arrayed,
Of Luna's milk and solar blaze, the peacock's tail adorns its gates.
A marriage true, of alchemists' acclaim, the hermaphrodite is born today,
In coupling sweet, and pure embrace, they coalesce in blessed space.

The Sulphur Yellow and furtive Salt, in arms aligned, the child exalts.
With planets' songs, the symphony mourns, the cadence hides a secret born
Each metal's breadth, a planetary note, in Mercury's voice, the chords devote
To melodies of hidden spheres, through seven layers, the resonance nears.

The Rubedo dawned, the Phoenix's alight, in triumph and fire, the path ignites,
With crimson hue, the stone reveals, a royal feast, the lion peels.
No longer bound by chains of old, transmuted lives, the paths unfold,
To Mercury's touch, regarded well, the elixir forged and all shall quell.

Oh, bless us from the heavens high, the link unseen that binds the sky,
In glowing gifts, Sophia's grace, with heart imbued, the thread we chase.
To glimpse, t'adore, such sacred art, the Philosopher's Stone within my heart,
It beats, it breathes; united paths entwined, all-universal truths, enshrined.
