The relationship between the Sibylline Oracles, Delphic Oracle, and the Book of Revelation is a complex interplay of prophetic messages that encompass significant aspects of ancient culture, history, and the esoteric. To analyze their interconnectedness and divergences, we need to first establish the context in which these prophetic writings were developed, the audience they were intended for and the messages they conveyed. Then, we can delve into the cultural, historical, and esoteric factors that shaped their creation. In doing so, we will uncover the profound impact these works had on the ancient world and the role prophecy played in shaping the lives of the people who followed these oracles.

Context and Overview:

The Sibylline Oracles are a collection of Hellenistic-Jewish and early Christian writings, likely written between the 2nd century BCE and the 7th century CE. These texts contain prophetic verses attributed to the mythical figure, the Sibyl, and focus on apocalyptic themes, including the end times, the final judgment, and the coming of a messiah.

The Delphic Oracle was an ancient Greek oracle in the city of Delphi, where the Pythia, a priestess, would give counsel and prophecies to those who sought her wisdom. The oracular messages typically took the form of poetic verses and often provided guidance on matters of state, politics, and personal decision-making. 

The Book of Revelation is the final book of the Christian New Testament, traditionally attributed to John of Patmos, and believed to be written in the late 1st century CE. The text is an apocalyptic work that unveils the ultimate fate of humanity, including the final judgment, the end of the world, and the establishment of a new heaven and earth.

Intersections and Divergences:

The first notable intersection between the Sibylline Oracles, the Delphic Oracle, and the Book of Revelation is their focus on prophecy as a means to convey messages of societal importance. Each work emphasizes the role of prophecy in guiding human life, whether it be through the revelation of future events, divine instruction, or divine warnings. In all three cases, prophecies are seen as a channel for divine communication, connecting the earthly realm to the divine.

Another intersection is the culture of mysticism and esotericism that pervades the prophetic messages. All three works employ cryptic language, symbols, and allegory to communicate their messages, which are frequently open to interpretation by initiates and scholars. This esoteric approach served to protect the prophetic teachings, allowing them to persist through centuries as their messages were deciphered and interpreted by succeeding generations.

The divergence between the Sibylline Oracles, Delphic Oracle, and Book of Revelation can be found in their themes and philosophical underpinnings. The Sibylline Oracles and Book of Revelation are primarily apocalyptic texts highlighting divine judgment, the end times, and the coming of a savior figure. In contrast, the Delphic Oracle focuses more on practical, everyday guidance. This difference can be attributed to the cultural dynamics in which they were produced (Hellenistic-Jewish and early Christian cultures for the Sibylline Oracles and the Book of Revelation, and an ancient Greek society for the Delphic Oracle).

Influencing Factors:

A variety of historical, cultural, and esoteric factors influenced the creation of these prophetic works. During the Hellenistic period, Jewish and early Christian writers, influenced by their environment, crafted the Sibylline Oracles as a response to the religious syncretism of the time. Additionally, these texts may have been the authors' attempts to promote monotheism within a largely polytheistic and culturally diverse world.

The Delphic Oracle was a product of ancient Greek society, with its complex mythology and tendency towards philosophical inquiry. The role of the Pythia as a mediator between the divine and mortal realms highlights the Greek cultural emphasis on the idea of divine-human interactions. Moreover, the Delphic Oracle's practical guidance speaks to the importance of the social-political context in ancient Greek prophecy.

The Book of Revelation likely evolved from early Christian communities' experiences of persecution, war, and religious tensions. The apocalyptic nature of the text mirrors the tumultuous times, offering hope for a new world order based on divine justice and righteousness.

**Conclusion**:

The Sibylline Oracles, the Delphic Oracle, and the Book of Revelation showcase the intricate web of prophetic messages that have influenced human thought and action throughout history. Their intersections, such as the use of prophecy as a divine communication tool, symbolic language, and an esoteric approach, reflect a shared methodology employed by their authors across different times and cultures.

Meanwhile, their divergences, such as the distinctive themes and cultural underpinnings, demonstrate the uniqueness of each work in its approach to prophecy. The analysis of these differences sheds light on the way historical, cultural, and esoteric factors played a role in shaping these oracular texts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the purpose and impact of prophecy in the ancient world.
