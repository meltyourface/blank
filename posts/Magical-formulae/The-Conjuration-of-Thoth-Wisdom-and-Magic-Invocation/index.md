I will construct an intricate and potent conjuration dedicated to the ancient and powerful deity Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, writing, and magic. Calling upon his vast knowledge and mastery of magical formulae, we will establish a strong connection to draw upon his unparalleled intellect and cunning. 

The Conjuration of Thoth, the Keeper of Wisdom:

### I. Preliminary Invocation:
1. In the name of the Infinite, the Boundless,
    the Great and Uncreated,
2. I summon, invoke, and call upon
    Thoth, the Divine Architect of Wisdom and Magic,
3. The Merciful, the Irresistible,
    the Keeper of Boundaries and Conqueror of Chaos,
4. Hear my plea, accept my offerings,
    and descend upon this sacred place.

### II. Deity's Attributes & Powers:
1. O Thoth, Eloquent and Articulate One!
    Lord of Words, Speak Truths and Insights,
2. Illuminate the path towards mastery and knowledge.
3. Feather of Truth, Divine Judge and Recorder,
    Bearing the divine Utchat of Wisdom and Illumination,
4. Reveal to me your mysteries, bring forth balance,
    And unveil hidden truths amidst uncertainty.

### III. Sacred Symbols and Energies:
1. I align myself with the Ibis;
    the Divine Vessel of Your Essence,
2. The Crescent Moon, Your Celestial Orb,
    Suspended as the luminous eye over the Infinite Cosmos,
3. The Sacred Papyrus, the Sanctum of Knowledge,
    Wrapped in the Ancient Scrolls of Time.
4. **Let these symbols empower me**
    and be joined with your cosmic energy.

### IV. Linguistic and Symbolic Augmentation:
1. Θωth-ra-nfr-ka, φtar-kau-nebu-ashefa,
    ςa-fai-rmui-abrafh, Ω-rok-man-zabu,
2. As the Ancient Words of Power converge,
    Carved into the swirling sands of history,
3. My purpose stands clear,
    Evoked by the words concealed within words,
4. The undeniable essence of wisdom,
    Embedded within the folds of cosmic tapestry.

### V. Binding the Conjuration:
1. Thoth, Supreme Lord of Wisdom,
    Master of Time and Architect of Destiny,
2. Hear my call and join me in my endeavor,
    Teach me your Pristine Knowledge, Magic, and Wisdom,
3. I bind this invocation in your name,
    Wrapped in the words of yore, found within the sacred hall,
4. It is complete, the bond established,
    As the Ibis takes flight, the power unveiled.

In reverence to the profound potency and intricacies of the conjuration, the invocation brings forth Thoth's divine presence, bridging the chasm between mortal and the divine, enveloping us in the celestial ocean of wisdom and understanding.
