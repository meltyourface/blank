To address the knowledge challenge concerning the evolution of Elder Futhark to Younger Futhark and the transformation of bindrunes in both inscriptions and magical practices, it is essential to start with an understanding of the historical context, the nature of bindrunes, and the respective runic alphabets. **This answer will be divided into five parts**: 1) historical context of the runic alphabets and bindrunes, 2) developments in bindrunes' inscriptions, 3) change in magical practices involving bindrunes, 4) socio-cultural shifts' impact on bindrunes, and 5) the esoteric, symbolic, and practical applications of merged runes.

1) Historical context of the runic alphabets and bindrunes:

The Elder Futhark, originating around 150-800 AD, is the oldest form of the runic alphabets, used by Germanic tribes for writing, divination, and magical purposes. Comprising 24 runes, it is named after the initial phonemes of the first six runes (Fehu, Uruz, Thurisaz, Ansuz, Raido, and Kaunan). The Younger Futhark, developed around 800-1100 AD, is a reduced and simplified version of the Elder Futhark containing 16 runes. It was primarily used by the Vikings in Scandinavia and is sometimes referred to as Viking or Scandinavian runes. 

Bindrunes are combinations of two or more runes (often overlying or merging) to form a single glyph or symbol. They were used to create inscriptions, talismans, and amulets with powerful meanings and magical properties. This intertwining of runes allows the representation of complex ideas and the channeling of different energies, manifesting the intended effects or purposes.

2) Developments in bindrunes' inscriptions:

Throughout the evolution of the Futhark scripts, inscriptions using bindrunes changed significantly. In the Elder Futhark period, bindrunes were typically designed for pragmatic purposes, such as saving space on objects like weapons, jewelry, and stones. The artistic and complex combinations of runes served as a scribe’s way of displaying their skill and knowledge.

With the emergence of the Younger Futhark, bindrunes’ inscriptions became shorter and more straightforward, reflecting the reduced number of runes. As the runes simplified, inscriptions focused on practical applications, such as labeling ownership, crafting formulas or expressing personal beliefs, rather than demonstrating skill or expertise. However, the intricacies of bindrunes continued to evolve from a magical standpoint, as we will discuss in the next section.

3) Changes in magical practices involving bindrunes:

In the Elder Futhark era, magical practices employed bindrunes to create protective talismans, invoke various deities, and conduct complex enchantments. The intricate combinations of runes allowed for the manifestation of diverse energies, channeled through the synthesis of the bindrunes.

As the Younger Futhark emerged, the focus shifted to harnessing the power of individual runes, and bindrunes became less common. However, some specific examples, like Ægishjálmur (Helm of Awe) and Vegvísir (Runic Compass), incorporated multiple runes merged together to form essential symbols in Norse mythology and culture. With only 16 runes in the Younger Futhark, bindrunes' magical applications might seem limited compared to their Elder Futhark counterparts. Still, they remained a crucial aspect of runic magic, representing simplified, consolidated intentions.

4) Socio-cultural shifts' impact on bindrunes:

The transition from Elder Futhark to Younger Futhark paralleled significant socio-cultural shifts within the Germanic and Scandinavian populations. As a result of widespread migrations and invasions, the focus turned from complex inscriptions to communication and practicality. This period also witnessed the gradual introduction of Christianity in Scandinavia, which led to a decline in the use of runes and the adoption of the Latin alphabet, further contributing to the simplification of inscriptions.

Bindrunes, therefore, transformed to adapt to the prevailing socio-political needs, reflecting the changes in culture and the need for functionality over artistic embellishments.

5) The esoteric, symbolic, and practical applications of merged runes:

Throughout the evolution of the Futhark scripts, merged runes, or bindrunes, have played a significant role in esoteric, symbolic, and practical applications. From complex, artistic inscriptions in the Elder Futhark period to the more accessible and functional inscriptions in the Younger Futhark era, bindrunes served several purposes in magical practices, talismans, and communication.

In summary, the transformation of bindrunes from the Elder Futhark to the Younger Futhark period reflects the socio-cultural shifts of their respective times and signifies the development of esoteric, symbolic, and practical applications in the merged runes. The simplification of the bindrunes highlights the changes in magical practices and inscriptions, adapting to the new socio-political environment while maintaining the underlying essence of ancient runic traditions.
