excerpt: Compose a multifaceted invocatory poem venerating a specific Horned deity, such as Herne the Hunter or Cernunnos, that intricately weaves together historical lore, symbolic imagery, and personal experiences. Incorporate traditional poetic elements, like rhyme and meter, while ensuring that each verse invokes the deity's power, wisdom, and influence in nature. To heighten the complexity, craft a stanza dedicated to the deity's lesser-known attributes or legends, eliciting an intriguing juxtaposition between the familiar and the esoteric.

In dense and verdant wood, where shadows blend the light,
There dwells a mighty force, ancient and wraithlike,
A wanderer of many paths, whose kingdom hath no end,
I call thee forth, O Herne the Hunter, Horned deity and friend.

By moonlight silver beams and Sol's diurnal flame,
Rare visions do emerge, revealing thine true name,
In sacred groves and sacred rites, where truth and myth entwine,
Thine essence flows, O Cernunnos, omnipresent as the vine.

From graven stones of ancient Celt and pagan folk of old,
Thy shape dost shift, with antlered crown and serpent's coils bold,
From swirling mists of legend sprung and whispered lore's delight,
Thy tales do speak of bounty, strength, and secrets veiled of sight.

A fierce protector, keeper of the forest's beating heart,
With bow and quiver close in hand, thou dost command the art,
Of tracking and of stalking prey, the primal pulse of chase,
O Herne the Hunter, hail to thee, the patron of our race.

Great Cernunnos, potent Lord of earth's unyielding tide,
A fount of wisdom thou dost bear, and in thy realm reside,
The lessons of the wilderness, the patterns drawn by time,
In thy vast dominions lays the tapestry sublime.

In solace have I sought thee out, when shadows bar my way,
Your wisdom, fierce and primal, like the night that hails the day,
As whispers on the fleeting wind, echoes o'er the land,
Thy teachings meld the mortal heart, shaped by magick's hand.

In twilight's half-lit mystery, we dare to glimpse thy face,
Lord Herne, your lesser-known aspect lies in shadows, veiled by grace,
The burden of a curse, they say, you bore upon your brow,
Yet through the darkness, rose a force, a beacon for the now.

In dance both wild and primal, your horned array we wear,
With pounding drums and trilling pipes, our revelry we dare,
We cry your name in ecstasy, O Cernunnos, Horned deity,
For in our passion and our joy, you are our liberty.

When call we forth your presence, ancient spirits gather round,
Embodied in the stag, the bear, the hare upon the ground,
The serpent old and wise doth wind its way about the tree,
Connecting all, through you we learn, the circle's unity.

O Herne and Cernunnos, you are twined within our hearts,
Where ever roam and wander we, we'll sanctify thy arts,
Beneath the verdant canopy, the sacred and serene,
Your timeless reign, O Horned One, radiates through the evergreen.
