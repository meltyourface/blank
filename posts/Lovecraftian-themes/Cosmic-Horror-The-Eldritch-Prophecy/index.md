Draw upon the obscure, hidden knowledge of the Old Ones and their sinister machinations, weaving elements of psychological horror and unfathomable cosmic entities to craft a nightmarish account of doom that will engulf humanity and the very fabric of reality itself. Generate an array of interconnected omens, portents, and arcane symbols that herald the dark fate that awaits the world, and depict the pervading sense of impending doom and despair that blankets the minds of those who dare to decipher the cryptic prophecy.

In the dark ages before the tides of mankind rose to meet the weighty hand of temporal destiny, there were whispered makings of an eldritch prophecy uttered in tongues long dead by seers tormented by visions emanating from the churning void beyond the stars. At the event horizon between sleep and waking madness, fragmentary knowledge of this nightmarish revelation scrapes the margins of sanity, gouged into half-remembered dreams by the beastial claw of ancient cosmic forces.

And as the stars will align, manifold omens shall swirl about the earth, foreshadowing the cataclysmic birth of doom from the blackened womb of cosmic chaos. As the earth trembles, so shall the skies darken with the absence of distant suns grown cold and bleak. A cacophony of voices shall rise, ethereal in origin, cacophonous in melody, screeching the desperate notes of hysteria born from unknowable terror. Seas will surge, swell and devour the land, as if reabsorbing the foulness of human endeavor deep into its briny tempestuous depths.

This prophecy, once lost within the passage of the aeons, hides within itself the secrets of the Old Ones: malignant beings moving beneath the surface of mortal comprehension, their fathomless presence stirring a tangible aura of horror at the edge of reality. Unspeakable in appearance, these abominations mock the frail forms of humanity, their very existence an insult to the geometric constraints of time and space. As the glacial pace of their cosmic machinations grinds forward, the eyes of mortals will be opened to their sinister intent, and the sanity of the world will shatter in their presence.

All shall bow to the silence that speaks as deafeningly as the tortured cries emanating from the catacombs of endless suffering. A false prophet, draped in the robes of ambition, shall be instrumental in weaving the tapestry of doom, as he unlocks the ancient terrors shewed into the depths of forgotten tombs, paving the way for the reawakening of the slumbering Old Ones.

With guile and obfuscation, these dread beings shall cast a shroud of shadows through which shall emerge twisted horrors from the spaces in between the stars. Across land and sky, rivers of ichor as dark as the void beyond creation shall seep, consuming all in its path, leaving naught but a howling wasteland where the skeletal remains of civilisation were once erected. Cursed sigils, etched with blasphemous runes, shall sully the air, holding the earth in a choking grip of despair, as the symphony of onerous dread echoes through the cosmos.

And as the spectral curtain that separates existence from the vast reaches of non-existence is weathered and worn, the veil shall tear asunder, expelling hordes of nightmarish abominations upon the world. Their formless cackles echoing in the frigid air, the children of eternal darkness shall delight in the extinguishing of the light of reason.

For all of mankind shall drown in the midst of the collapsing universe, their feeble minds overcome by the despair that strangles the very essence of their souls. Humanity's sense of self shall be fractured shards, scattered upon the winds of cosmic indifference, as the Old Ones rise to claim their dark dominion over what remains of a dying world. The slivering tendrils of the void shall constrict around the throats of all that persists, snuffing out the embers of eternity, heralding the final silence as existence itself is consumed by the pervasive malevolence of the dark forces that launched the prophecy ages past.
