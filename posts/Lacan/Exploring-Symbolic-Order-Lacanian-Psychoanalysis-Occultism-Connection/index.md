  Analyze the symbolic order within Lacanian psychoanalysis and its parallels with occultism, considering the constructed nature of both language and the reality it shapes. How do the three registers (Real, Imaginary, and Symbolic) connect to the principles of Hermeticism, such as the "As above, So below" axiom, in forming an individual's subjective experience?

The Symbolic Order within Lacanian Psychoanalysis

To begin our inquiry, we must first examine the symbolic order within Lacanian psychoanalysis. The symbolic order is one of the three primary registers in Lacan's triadic structure – the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic – which comprises the totality of human experience. The symbolic order represents the realm of language, culture, and symbols that shape and give meaning to our experiences and actions.

Language, in its deepest sense, is a way to structure reality, and Lacan highlights the vital role that language plays in constructing subjectivity, desire, and identity. He asserts that we are inescapably enmeshed within language, and our processes of subject formation are determined by the intricate webs of symbolization and signification that underlie our linguistic system.

Parallels with Occultism

Turning to the realm of occultism, there are both differences and similarities when compared to Lacanian psychoanalysis. Occultism refers to a set of beliefs and practices centered around the acquisition of hidden knowledge and the pursuit of spiritual truths, often through metaphysical or paranormal means.

Both Lacanian psychoanalysis and occultism recognize the significance of symbols and symbolic systems in shaping our understanding of reality. Occult practices, such as the Tarot, astrology, or alchemy, rely on a symbolic language to communicate profound truths about the universe and the individual's place within it. These symbolic languages act as a bridge between the metaphysical and the physical realms, aiming to unveil deeper insights into the nature of existence.

Connections between Registers and Hermeticism

Now, let us explore how Lacan's registers connect to principles of Hermeticism, particularly the maxim "As above, So below." Hermeticism is an ancient philosophical tradition with roots in Hellenistic Egypt which seeks to uncover divine wisdom through theurgy and sacred texts.

The Hermetic axiom "As above, So below" encapsulates the idea that the macrocosm (the universe) is a reflection of the microcosm (the individual), and that the dynamics governing the cosmos also apply to human experience. This notion resonates with Lacan's three registers, through which he seeks to describe the complex interrelations between our external world, our internal psyche, and the cultural-symbolic context that unites them.

1. **Real**: The Real in Lacanian analysis represents an ungraspable, inaccessible reality that exists beyond language and symbolization. It is the external realm that stays out of reach, and our attempts to confront it are met with anxiety and trauma. In Hermeticism, the Real can be linked to the macrocosm of the universe and its ineffable essence, transcending human comprehension.

2. **Imaginary**: The Imaginary, on the other hand, refers to the inner world of fantasy, illusion, and self-image formation. It is where our psychic life unfolds and takes shape, defined by unconscious desires and images. Hermeticism explores our connection with the divine and our place in the cosmos, mirroring the Imaginary's quest for self-knowledge and discovery in the microcosm of the individual.

3. **Symbolic**: Finally, the Symbolic represents the realm of culture, language, and societal structures that frame our understanding of reality. Just as the occult employs symbols for divination and apprehending metaphysical truths, Lacan sees symbolic systems as the mediator between the Real and Imaginary, shaping our subjective experiences.

In conclusion, the symbolic order within Lacan's psychoanalysis resonates with the esoteric principles and practices of occultism, particularly in the emphasis they both place on the power of symbols and language to structure reality and shape the subject's experience. The connections between Lacan's registers and the Hermetic axiom "As above, So below" highlight the profound commonalities between these diverse perspectives, ultimately revealing a shared quest for understanding the nature of the self and the world.
