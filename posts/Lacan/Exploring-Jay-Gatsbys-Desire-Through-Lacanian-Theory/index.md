For this analysis, I have chosen the character of Jay Gatsby from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, "The Great Gatsby". Gatsby's development serves as a prime example of an individual's desire, as examined through the lens of Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory. The novel is rich in symbolic imagery and explores the concepts of desire, identity, and the American Dream.

Gatsby's interactions with the Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real orders illustrate the complexity of his subjectivity. The Imaginary order can be seen in Gatsby's idealized version of himself and Daisy, his object of desire. Gatsby's imagination fuels his willingness to pursue his desires and transcend beyond his humble roots, leading to feelings of success and accomplishment.

The Symbolic order can be observed in Gatsby's social interactions and performed identity. Through language acquisition and the use of symbolic representations, Gatsby transforms himself into a wealthy, mysterious, and sophisticated persona. His parties and lavish lifestyle are manifestations of his desires and attempts to fit into a society that he perceives will lead him closer to Daisy.

The Real order is evident in the tragic, inevitable consequences of Gatsby's obsession with his unattainable desire. The Real permeates his life, manifesting itself in the form of Tom Buchanan, who represents a concrete obstacle to Gatsby's desires. The death of Myrtle, Gatsby's eventual demise, and the ultimate rejection of his dream by Daisy all belong to the order of the Real.

Gatsby's relationship with the Other, as epitomized by Daisy, provides further insight into his desires. The Lacanian "Other" refers to an external entity that functions as a mirror for one’s subjectivity, playing a crucial role in the formation of a person’s sense of self. For Gatsby, Daisy serves as both the object of his desire and the Other that he seeks to impress and appease.

The mirror stage, an essential component of Lacanian theory, can be applied to Gatsby's past experiences when he first encountered Daisy. This stage suggests that individuals develop a sense of self initially by identifying with an external reflection, forming an idealized image of themselves. Gatsby's infatuation with Daisy stems from a need to align himself with his own idealized version, and he subsequently devotes his life to achieving his ideal self with Daisy.

Language acquisition plays a significant role in Gatsby's development, as he manipulates words and symbols to project the image of an affluent, charming, and erudite individual. He adjusts his speech patterns and vocabulary to present a persona that contrasts with his humble, working-class background. The power of language creates a divide between Gatsby's previous self (James Gatz) and his idealized self (Jay Gatsby).

As Gatsby navigates complex social dynamics in the novel, his evolving desires continue to shape his growth. His desire for Daisy motivates him to create and maintain an image of success and wealth embodying the American Dream. Notably, his growth is paradoxical, as his pursuit of his desires ultimately leads to his unraveling and demise. Despite his attempts to transform his identity and desires into tangible realities, he becomes a prisoner of his own ambition.

In conclusion, Lacanian psychoanalytic theory offers valuable insight into Gatsby's character development, providing us with a lens to examine his interactions with the Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real orders, as well as the relationship between his desire and the Other. By considering the significance of the mirror stage, language acquisition, and the formation of subjectivity, we gain a better understanding of Gatsby's motivations, interpersonal relationships, and ultimate self-realization. His tragic end serves as a reminder of the limitations and consequences of desire, and the complexity of what it means to create and pursue an ideal self.
