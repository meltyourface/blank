In this response, we shall explore and compare the various forms and representations of Harbingers of Death found in Greek, Norse, and Hindu cultural mythologies. By examining the symbolism, purpose, and cultural context of these entities, we can discern their impact on each culture's beliefs and perceptions of death. Furthermore, by analyzing their similarities and differences, we can gain insights into the universal human fascination with the unknown and the efficacy of death-related myths.

In Greek mythology, one of the most prominent figures associated with death is Thanatos, the god of non-violent death. He is characterized by a mixture of beauty and somberness. The brother of Hypnos, the god of sleep, and son of Nyx, the goddess of the night, Thanatos represents the natural end of one's life. He gently carries the souls of the deceased to Hades, the underworld. Symbolically, Thanatos embodies the inevitability and tranquility of dying, exemplified by his serene and almost compassionate demeanor.

In Norse mythology, the Valkyries are a group of female figures who act as the primary harbingers of death. They are warrior-angel like beings that choose the bravest fallen warriors in battle and guide them to Valhalla, the great hall presided over by Odin, the chief of the gods. The purpose of the Valkyries highlights the martial nature of Norse society, emphasizing the ideal of dying a glorious death in battle, a fitting end to a life dedicated to the pursuit of honor, bravery, and strength.

Hindu mythology introduces Yama, the god of death and lord of the underworld. Yama, the son of the sun god Surya and brother to the god of prosperity and wealth, Kubera, is portrayed as a righteous and fair judge. His role is to evaluate the balance of one's good and bad deeds, deciding the course of their afterlife. Yama is often depicted with dark green or blue skin and riding a buffalo, holding a noose to collect the souls of the deceased. Yama's existence instills the ideology of karma within the Hindu culture, fostering a strong sense of morality and the importance of leading an ethical life.

While Thanatos, Valkyries, and Yama come from different cultural contexts and incorporate various mythological elements, they are unified in serving as symbols and reminders of the inescapable nature of death. Each figure, in their own unique way, conveys the tenets of their respective cultures â€“ the notion of a peaceful and natural death in Greek society, the celebration of fallen warriors and the ultimate reward of Valhalla for the honorable dead in Norse mythology, and the principle of karma and moral responsibility toward life cycles in Hinduism. 

These similarities suggest that the human fascination with death transcends individual cultures, prompting the creation of deities and entities to personify and conceptualize the end of life. The subtle differences, however, demonstrate how each culture's unique values, histories, and beliefs shape their views and interpretations of death; Thanatos reflects the Greek insistence on individualism and acceptance of the individual's end, the Valkyries pay homage to the warrior spirit of the Norse, and Yama upholds the moral balance in the Hindu cycle of life.

In conclusion, Harbingers of Death play a vital role in various cultural mythologies by elucidating the human imagination and the struggle to comprehend mortality. Greek, Norse, and Hindu mythologies offer strikingly different interpretations of death through Thanatos, the Valkyries, and Yama, respectively. Although they share a common thread of enigmatically representing the end of life, their symbolism, purpose, and cultural contexts are distinct and illuminating. By examining these entities, we gain insights into the power of myth and how cultural values shape beliefs, narratives, and perceptions of death.
