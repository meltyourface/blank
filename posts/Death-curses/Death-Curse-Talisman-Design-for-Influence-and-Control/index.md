excerpt: Design a highly-detailed and symbolically-rich talisman with the purpose of channeling and amplifying the power of Death curses, drawing from historical and fictional references. Incorporate a unique arrangement of symbols, such as runes, sigils, and geometric patterns, to maximize the potency of the curse. Consider the selection of materials, such as rare gemstones and metals, to enhance the talisman's effectiveness and ensure the successful invocation of the death curse with precision and control.

Talisman Design:

The talisman will be shaped as a hexagon, representing the six realms of existence, with each vertex symbolizing one realm. At the center of the hexagon will be a black onyx, chosen for its properties of protection, grounding energy, and connection to the shadow realms. 

Materials:

- A hexagonal silver frame, chosen for its conductivity and psychic enhancing properties.
- Six rare gemstones, each representing a realm of existence:
  1. Jasper (Human Realm)
  2. Labradorite (Demi-God Realm)
  3. Amethyst (God Realm)
  4. Bloodstone (Animal Realm)
  5. Obsidian (Hungry Ghost Realm)
  6. Garnet (Hell Realm)
- Black onyx at the center (for protection and connection to death curse energies)
- Black gold inlay to accentuate details on the silver frame

Symbols and Patterns:

1. Ansuz rune, signifying communication and divine messages, will be carved into the top vertex of the hexagon, symbolizing the talisman weaving its curse through verbal incantation.

2. Necronomicon sigil, a symbol of dark knowledge and power, will be engravd on the bottom left vertex, drawing on the power of the fictional tome to add potency to the curse.

3. The Eye of Horus, representing protection and resurrection, will be etched on the bottom right vertex. In this context, it represents returning a curse's energy to its caster, intensifying the death curse's power when needed.

4. Bind runes, combining Gebo (gift), Hagalaz (chaos), and Naudiz (binding) will be inscribed on the two side vertices and the top-left vertex of the hexagon, linking the talisman's power to the concept of gifting chaos and binding the curse to its target.

5. Placed along the inner edges of the hexagon are black gold inlay engravings of the alchemical symbol for "mortificatio," the union of death and spiritual rebirth, signifying the powerful transformative nature of the death curse.

6. A hexagram pattern will be etched within the hexagon, connecting the gemstones to the central black onyx and signifying the interconnectedness of the realms and their influence on the talisman's power.

To invoke the death curse, the practitioner must place the talisman on a surface inscribed with a perfect circle and aheptagram. This allows the talisman to draw on the energy of the ancient planetary influences. Incense made of belladonna, nightshade, and mandrake must be burned, and the practitioner must recite an incantation of their design, invoking the powers and symbols present on the talisman.

With this talisman in hand, the wielder can channel and amplify the power of death curses, ensuring their success with precision and control.
