Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956), an enigmatic artist and occultist, remains a subject of fascination for those who study the nexus of esoteric art and sexual magic. Spare's personal inclinations and interactions with his contemporaries, as well as his contributions to the erotic current of esoteric art and surrealism, shed light on the motivations driving his creative genius.

Born in London, Spare's artistic talents were evident from a young age. As a teenager, he began studying at the Royal College of Art and eventually became involved in the bohemian London art scene. However, Spare's true passions lay in the esoteric sphere, specifically magical practices and the exploration of the human unconscious. His interest in these subjects was apparent in both his artistic creations and his relationships with other significant figures in the Sorcery and Magic community.

Spare's explorations into the realm of magic led him to develop a friendship with Aleister Crowley, one of the most influential occultists of the 20th century. Although they held differing perspectives on ritualistic practices, the two found common ground in their mutual interest in sexual magic. Together, they explored the nature of the erotic current in esoteric art, each bringing their unique perspectives and spiritual beliefs to the craft.

For Spare, the concept of Sigils was an integral element of his magical system. His belief in the power of these ideographic symbols manifested in his art and served as a cornerstone of his practice. Employing sigil-based methods, he created intricate drawings designed to induce subconscious thought and trigger spiritual experiences. Spare was likewise intrigued by automatic drawing techniques, using them to uncover hidden aspects of the soul and engage in self-discovery through artistic creation.

Spare's approach to sexual magic was rooted in his examination of the erotic current in esoteric art. He viewed sexual energy as a potent force capable of manifesting one's desires and will, imbuing his artwork with sensuous, often provocative, themes. Spare postulated that by harnessing this energy through magical techniques and allowing it to flow through one's creative work, an artist could transcend their physical limitations and access higher realms of consciousness.

The interplay between Spare's spiritual beliefs and his artistic output is evident in his often controversial, surreal, and erotic artwork. One example is his series of visionary portraits of witches and magical beings that reveal the influence of his exposure to witchcraft on his work. In another instance, Spare engaged in a practice he termed "atavistic resurgence," aiming to access and depict the primal memories of humanity through his art.

Anecdotal evidence from Spare's life reveals intriguing aspects of the subculture he inhabited. Known for his eccentric lifestyle, he was said to have kept a menagerie of strange animals in his London home and lived on a diet consisting primarily of cakes and pastries. His connection to London's thriving occult scene was also evident in his participation in s√©ances and psychic experiments with fellow esoteric practitioners.

Despite his association with magical groups and individuals, Spare remained an enigmatic, elusive figure throughout his life. His art and magical practices continue to inspire occultists, artists, and those who seek to understand the hidden forces at play in our world. Austin Osman Spare's life and work stand as a testament to the untapped potential inherent in the connection between the spiritual, sexual, and artistic aspects of the human experience.
