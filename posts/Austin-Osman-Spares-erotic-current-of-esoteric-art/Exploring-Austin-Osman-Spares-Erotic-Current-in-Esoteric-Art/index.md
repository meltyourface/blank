## Chapter: The Erotic Current of Austin Osman Spare's Esoteric Art

Introduction

Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956) was an influential English artist and occultist. His unique approach to magic combined eroticism, sigils, and a personal philosophy into a powerful and transformative current of esoteric practice. Spare's work has continued to resonate with initiates who seek to delve into the depths of their own desires and harness the power of their personal wills. In this chapter, we will explore the core tenets and techniques of Spare's erotic current, as well as its philosophical underpinnings.

### I. Sexuality and the Will

For Spare, sexuality was a gateway to the divine. He believed that sexual energy could be harnessed to fuel one's magical workings and enable the practitioner to transcend the limitations of ordinary existence. The nexus of this belief lay in the concept of the Will - a primal force that drives human beings to express themselves and shape their reality.

According to Spare, the Will is usually constrained by societal norms and the constraints of mundane life. The erotic current in his esoteric art serves as a means to unleash this latent potential. By embracing and channeling their sexuality, practitioners can tap into the unrestricted power of their true selves and harness it to achieve their desires.

### II. Sigil Magic and the Alphabet of Desire

Central to Spare's magic is the use of sigils, which represent the practitioner's desires in symbolic form. He outlined a method of creating sigils using what he called the "Alphabet of Desire." This process involves condensing the desire into a single word or phrase, eliminating any repeating letters, and then designing a unique symbol by incorporating the remaining letters into a single image.

In the context of Spare's erotic current, sigils can be created to represent sexual desires as well as broader goals to be accomplished through the harnessing of one's sexual energy. Once the sigil is created, it should be charged with the practitioner's intent, which can be accomplished through a variety of methods. These methods include meditative focus, chanting, and even incorporating the sigil into sexual acts.

### III. Trance and Atavistic Resurgence

Spare believed that one could access the depths of the subconscious mind by entering a trance state. This state allows the practitioner to remove conscious filters and access a more primal state of mind. He referred to this process as "Atavistic Resurgence," which involved tapping into the collective memory of the human race and even ancestral or animalistic aspects of one's own lineage. By doing so, he believed that a wealth of knowledge and power could be unlocked.

In Spare's erotic current, trance states are often achieved through practices such as self-hypnotic meditation or focused sexual activity. During these states, the practitioner seeks to tap into the raw, primal essence of their being and use it to empower their magical workings.

### IV. The Philosophy of Self-Love

At the heart of Spare's teachings lies the concept of self-love. Spare believed that the process of self-discovery and the embracing of one's desires, particularly in the context of the erotic current, could lead to profound self-realization and spiritual growth.

In this system, self-love is not a narcissistic obsession with the self but rather an appreciation and understanding of one's true nature. It is an essential component for harnessing the full power of one's Will and using it to manifest one's desires in the world.

Conclusion

Austin Osman Spare's erotic current of esoteric art offers a transformative path for those who seek to engage with their sexuality as a means of empowerment and self-realization. By embracing the connections between sexuality, sigil magic, and Spare's personal philosophy, initiates can achieve a profound understanding of the powerful forces that shape our lives and employ them to manifest their deepest desires.
