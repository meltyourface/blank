## Chapter 6: The Occult Significance of Tribal Origins

Introduction to Tribal Spiritual Beliefs

Since time immemorial, ancient tribes from various parts of the world have reached beyond the veil to explore the esoteric and build vast bodies of spiritual knowledge. Their understanding of mystic arts laid the foundation for modern occult understanding and continues to provide opportunities for initiates to delve deeper into these realms. This chapter will expound on the spiritual beliefs, mystic practices, and unique symbolism found in some of the most influential ancient tribes, and how their teachings contribute to contemporary esoteric wisdom.

### I. Shamanic Traditions and Practices

At the epicenter of many tribal spiritual systems is the shaman – a spiritual healer, guide, and mediator between the physical and spiritual worlds. Their practices, often referred to as shamanism, revolve around entering altered states of consciousness to seek guidance from spirits, ancestors, and other transcendent beings. Universal shamanic practices include ritualistic dancing, drumming, chanting, consuming entheogenic plants, and even ascetic practices such as fasting and sleep deprivation.

Shamans have played a pivotal role in various tribal cultures, such as the Native American Nations, South American tribes, Siberian Tungusic communities, and African tribes. Their practices have influenced numerous contemporary esoteric traditions, including ceremonial magic, energy healing, and psychonautics.

### II. Animistic Worldviews and Symbolism

A widespread belief within tribal spiritual systems is animism, the notion that everything in nature, living or inanimate, possesses a spiritual essence or consciousness. These spirits and energies are believed to interact with humans and influence their well-being. In such a worldview, healing and mediations between these spirits and humans become paramount, fostering the development of complex rituals, belief systems, and artwork.

The symbols and artifacts created by these tribes represent essential aspects of their cosmology, deities, spirits, ancestors, and other metaphysical forces. One example is the Australian Aboriginal Dreamtime stories, which outline the creation of their world through the tales of ancestral beings who left behind sacred sites and symbols. Similarly, the West African Akan people embody their spiritual wisdom in Adinkra symbols, which encapsulate philosophical and esoteric concepts in intricately-designed visual forms. These symbols hold deep meaning and serve as a mode of communication between the spiritual and the physical, providing initiates with keys to unlocking the mysteries of the occult.

### III. Ancestral Wisdom & Ancestor Worship

The veneration of ancestors is another common theme that spans several tribal cultures, where past generations hold potent spiritual wisdom that influences the lives of their descendants. By respecting and revering their ancestors, individuals reconnect themselves to the collective knowledge, spiritual guidance, and intergenerational support that can help them through life's challenges.

African tribes such as the Yoruba expanded the veneration of ancestors into the realms of Ifá divination, wherein a seeker consults both ancestral spirits and an extensive system of archetypal energies called Orishas. The guidance and wisdom gleaned from these consultations deeply shape an individual's spiritual and mundane path.

### IV. Impact on Contemporary Esoteric Arts

The rich history and diversity of tribal spiritual practices have had a profound influence on the study of the occult in the present day. Modern esoteric traditions still draw heavily from the ancient tribal wisdom, such as the principles of shamanism, animistic worldviews, and ancestor veneration that cross boundaries of culture and geography.

Initiates seeking to deepen their understanding of the occult can derive significant insights from the spiritual beliefs, mystic practices, and symbolism of ancient tribes. By engaging with this ancestral wisdom, they can tap into the profound interconnectedness that exists between the esoteric arts, nature, and humanity. Many tribal practices and concepts are surprisingly consistent across the world, and these shared threads allow current seekers of occult knowledge to delve into the collective human psyche and uncover profound truths about the universe, consciousness, and the spiritual realm.
