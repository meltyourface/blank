B. Grimoires typically contained both angelic and demonic entities but prioritized infernal pacts for gaining power.

The intricate connections between grimoires, theurgic practices, and infernal pacts are best demonstrated in option B, as it acknowledges the complexity and diversity in the content of these texts. Grimoires, also known as Black Books, functioned as manuals for rituals and practices in European necromancy, providing instructions for conjuring spirits, making talismans, and forming pacts.

While some grimoires did feature only angelic or demonic content, most contained a mix of both, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of their practitioners. The Ars Notoria, mentioned in option A, is an example of a grimoire focusing on angelic conjurations. However, its absence of demonic content does not fully capture the broader practices of grimoires.

Theurgic practices, which involved invoking divine and celestial forces, often featured in grimoires alongside instructions for forming infernal pacts. This combination of forces showcases the duality present in the esoteric traditions and illustrates the willingness of practitioners to work with both angelic and demonic entities to achieve their goals.

The Grand Grimoire, also known as the Red Dragon, is an example of a text that primarily deals with demonic entities and infernal pacts. However, this does not mean it completely ignores angelic forces, as suggested in option C. While its focus is on summoning demons, the notion of harnessing celestial energies for protection or divine guidance remains relevant to its overarching theme of power acquisition.

Option D's statement, that Black Books and angelic forces were strictly forbidden, is incorrect and ignores the diversity found within these texts. Many grimoires, like the Sworn Book of Honorius and Clavicula Salomonis (Key of Solomon), provided instructions to work with both angelic and demonic entities, reflecting a broader interest in harnessing the energies of both for personal gain and expanding knowledge.

In conclusion, option B best demonstrates the intricate connections between grimoires, theurgic practices, and infernal pacts by acknowledging the diversity of entities called upon in these texts and the prioritization of infernal pacts for gaining power. This statement reflects the broader trends of necromancy and grimoire contents, emphasizing the adaptability of practitioners and the phenomenon of seeking a multitude of forces and entities for achieving desired outcomes in the esoteric arts.
