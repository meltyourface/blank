Ranging from ancient grimoires to later treatises, this tradition has been passed down through the centuries, shaping the landscape of contemporary necromantic practices.

### Chapter 2: Historical Origins

The roots of European necromancy can be traced back to early Greco-Roman practices, with further influences from the Jewish and Christian traditions. During the Middle Ages, necromancers began documenting their experiences and knowledge of the hidden arts in grimoires, allowing for a widening of the scope and reach of necromantic practices. Key historical events, such as the rise in hermeticism during the Renaissance period, greatly contributed to the development of necromantic literature.

Among the seminal works, texts such as "The Lesser Key of Solomon," "The Munich Manual of Demonic Magic," and "The Sworn Book of Honorius" have become crucial components of the necromantic literary canon. These works often feature in-depth instructions for summoning spirits, forging pacts with demons, and manipulating the elements.
