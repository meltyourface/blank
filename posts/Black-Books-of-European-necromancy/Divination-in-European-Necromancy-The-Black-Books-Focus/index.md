An emphasis on divination rather than direct summoning.

The primary aspect that differentiates the Black Books of European necromancy from other grimoires is their emphasis on divination, rather than direct summoning. While other grimoires may focus on the conjuring of spirits, demons, or other supernatural beings for various purposes, the Black Books are far more concerned with exploring the future and seeking hidden knowledge.

The Black Books stem from a long-standing tradition within European esoteric and occult circles, which date back to the medieval and Renaissance periods. These texts served as a repository for a wide range of magical knowledge and were often considered to be secret or forbidden, hence their association with the darker aspects of necromancy.

One key element in the Black Books is the incorporation of the Ars Notoria (the Notory Art). This magical art is primarily focused on obtaining hidden knowledge, learning occult wisdom, and achieving a greater understanding of one's place within the cosmos. The Ars Notoria consists of various prayers, invocations, and symbols, which are intended to grant the practitioner access to the divine realms and facilitate their ability to see and comprehend the future.

This focus on divination is rooted in the belief that obtaining knowledge of the future, as well as understanding the interconnectedness of all things, holds the key to harnessing the powers that govern the universe. By gaining foresight and clairvoyance, a practitioner of European necromancy could use the Black Books to better their understanding of the world's mysteries and their place within it.

Although the Black Books touch on many other aspects of esoteric knowledge and magical practice, such as alchemy, talismanic magic, and astrology, they purposefully limit their use of summoning practices in favor of divination. This divergence establishes the Black Books as a distinct branch within the occult tradition and sets them apart from other grimoires that primarily concentrate on summoning supernatural entities.

It is important to note that while the Black Books do contain elements of demonology, Christian symbolism, and influences from ancient magical practices, these aspects are not as prominently emphasized in comparison to the comprehensive approach to divination. The Black Books are therefore unique in their endeavor to uncover the deeper truths of the world and to empower the practitioner with the ability to see beyond the veil of reality that separates the living from the dead, the known from the unknown, and the mundane from the truly magical.
