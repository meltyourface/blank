To answer this knowledge challenge, let's first explore the ancient cultures and mythologies that shaped the foundational elements of European necromancy, then identify the key historical figures who contributed to its development, and finally, illustrate the convergence and divergence of these elements within the Black Books.

Ancient Cultures and Mythologies:

1. **Egyptian**: The ancient Egyptians had a profound impact on European necromancy due to their intricate beliefs in the afterlife. They believed in an immortal soul – the ka – which could interact with the living world even after death. This idea laid the foundation of necromancy, which aims to communicate with the deceased to gain knowledge or perform rituals.

2. **Mesopotamian**: The Mesopotamian cultures, such as the Sumerians and Babylonians, had a significant influence on necromancy as they believed in a complex pantheon of gods and spirits. Many necromantic rituals and invocations in the European Black Books draw inspiration from these ancient practices, particularly those that involve summoning spirits and deities for certain purposes, like protection or divination.

3. **Greek and Roman**: The Greco-Roman world was a significant source of inspiration for European necromancers. Their intricate mythologies, particularly the myths regarding the underworld and its deities – Hades and Pluto – provided necromancers with a framework for understanding the nature of the metaphysical world and summoning the dead. Additionally, the concept of daemonology originated in these mythologies and has become synonymous with European necromancy.

Key Historical Figures:

1. **Hermes Trismegistus**: Although a legendary rather than a historical figure, Hermes Trismegistus is considered the father of European necromancy. Allegedly possessing immense wisdom and knowledge, the Hermetic texts attributed to him, particularly the Corpus Hermeticum, provided vital information on the nature of the spirit world and were heavily studied by European necromancers.

2. **King Solomon**: The famed biblical figure, King Solomon, was said to possess supernatural knowledge and wisdom, making him an influential figure in necromancy. The Key of Solomon, an important grimoire, contains rituals and methods to invoke and communicate with various spirits, many of which are derived from Jewish and Christian mysticism.

3. **Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa**: Agrippa was a German scholar and occultist whose work, De Occulta Philosophia, became an essential resource for European necromancers. Agrippa synthesized elements of various ancient cultures and mythologies, making it easier for future practitioners to draw on diverse traditions in their necromantic practices.

Convergence and Divergence within the Black Books:

Black Books, a term used for various grimoires – books of magical knowledge – contain the essence of European necromancy. While these books converge in their goals of summoning and interact with the spirit world or the deceased, the rituals, invocations, and the use of occult symbols often diverge depending on the specific cultural and historical influences embraced by the author.

For example, some Black Books may focus on the Egyptian or Mesopotamian pantheons, while others may derive their practices from Greco-Roman or Christian traditions. Additionally, the role of certain historical figures can vary between books, as some may give prominence to figures like Solomon or Hermes, while others may altogether omit them.

In conclusion, the development and practice of European necromancy have been heavily influenced by ancient cultures and mythologies, such as Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Greco-Roman, as well as key historical figures, like Hermes Trismegistus, King Solomon, and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. These elements converge within the Black Books to create a rich tapestry of rituals and knowledge necessary for summoning the spirit world. However, each book also diverges, showcasing the unique perspective and methodology stemming from diverse cultural and historical backgrounds.
