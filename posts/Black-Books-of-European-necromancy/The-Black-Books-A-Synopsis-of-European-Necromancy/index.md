The answer is: The Black Books were compilations of fragmented texts and oral traditions that actively synthesized various necromantic practices from different regions.

The Black Books of European necromancy were not singular, authoritative texts; rather, they were an ever-evolving collection of knowledge and traditions that mirrored the ever-changing field of necromancy. These books served as a conduit for the exchange of ideas and practices, bridging the gap between various regions and cultures in Europe, and later, beyond.

The Black Books were often created by individual necromancers and practitioners, who gathered fragments of texts and oral traditions from various regions and sources, gradually accumulating necromantic knowledge in this patchwork fashion. As such, it would be more accurate to say that the books were more of a synthesis of numerous, smaller works bring together the esoteric, occult, and necromantic practices from different regions and time periods.

Necromancy itself has ancient roots, dating back to ancient Greece and Egypt, and has evolved significantly over time, through the Christian Middle Ages up to more modern practices. Throughout history, it has encompassed various forms of divination, the summoning of spirits, and the manipulation of the dead. The Black Books sought to compile these various practices, aiming for a more holistic understanding of the subject.

The interconnectedness of the Black Books with the vast web of necromantic practices is evident in the array of topics found within them. In addition to divination and spirit summoning, the texts also delved into matters of herbalism, astrology, alchemy, and folk magic, reflecting the vast range of elements that were incorporated into and connected to necromancy over time.

In conclusion, the Black Books acted as a pivotal component in the ever-evolving world of European necromancy, serving as repositories of diverse practices, ideas, and techniques, while providing a melting pot for the continuous exchange and synthesis of necromantic traditions across different regions and cultures.
