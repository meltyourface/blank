In response to the knowledge challenge, I will analyze the various methods, techniques, and entities described in two prominent Black Books of European necromancy: the 'Petit Albert' and the 'Munich Manual.' I will also discuss how these sources demonstrate the complex interplay between the wielders of necromantic power, the spirits they summon, and the cultural, religious, and philosophical contexts from which they emerge.

The 'Petit Albert' is an 18th-century French grimoire, primarily influenced by the works of Albertus Magnus, a medieval scholar and philosopher. It explores various topics ranging from magical amulets and talismans, potion recipes, and necromancy rituals to summoning spirits. **Some of the most common methods and techniques found in the 'Petit Albert' include**:

1. **Sigils and symbols**: The 'Petit Albert' features many sigils and symbols representing different spirits and powers. These sigils are used in rituals to call forth the associated spirits or energies and often appear on magical tools, such as talismans or parchment.

2. **Elemental correspondences**: The grimoire focuses on the four classical elements - earth, air, fire, and water â€“ and their correspondence with specific spirits or energies. This association is applied in ritual work, with the practitioner using these elements to manipulate or communicate with the spirits.

3. **Ritual tools and ingredients**: The 'Petit Albert' provides a detailed list of ritual tools and ingredients required to perform various necromantic and magical operations, including candles, incense, oils, and herbs. These items are believed to carry inherent magical properties and are crucial for successful magical workings.

The 'Munich Manual,' also known as the 'Clm 849,' is a 15th-century Latin manuscript that contains a collection of necromantic texts. It primarily consists of rituals for summoning and controlling spirits, as well as guidance on creating magical items like amulets and talismans. **Some of the key methods and techniques used in the 'Munich Manual' include**:

1. **Invocations and conjurations**: These are verbal formulas or prayers employed by the practitioner to invoke the presence of a spirit or force and establish control over it. The Munich Manual provides specific invocations for different spirits and purposes.

2. **Tools and sacrifices**: Similar to the 'Petit Albert,' the 'Munich Manual' emphasizes the importance of using various ritual tools and ingredients. However, it also highlights the use of animal sacrifices, typically associated with infernal or dark forces, as a means of summoning and appeasing specific spirits.

Both the 'Petit Albert' and the 'Munich Manual' demonstrate the complex interplay between the necromancer, the summoned spirits, and their cultural, religious, and philosophical contexts. Firstly, the texts embody the synthesis of various religious, occult, and philosophical influences from which they emerged. As both texts belong to different historical periods and geographical locations, they each reflect distinct cultural influences and iconography. For example, the 'Petit Albert' contains elements of Renaissance Humanism, Alchemy, and Christian mysticism, while the 'Munich Manual' exhibits strong medieval theological underpinnings.

The necromantic practices described in these texts reflect society's fear of the supernatural and the desire to control it through complex rituals and a deep understanding of natural and spiritual correspondences. The practitioners who wielded this power were often viewed with a mixture of awe and fear, with the texts serving as guides to navigate the perilous world of the supernatural.

Secondly, the texts showcase the delicate balance between control and submission in the interactions between the necromancer and summoned spirits. The rituals present in the texts often involve the practitioner establishing a level of authority over the spirits by invoking divine and earthly powers, using sacred symbols and utterances. Still, they should approach these spirits with respect and caution, as the maintenance of control is often precarious.

In conclusion, the 'Petit Albert' and 'Munich Manual' provide a wealth of information regarding the methods, techniques, and entities used in European necromantic practice. Their content demonstrates the intricate relationship between the necromancer, the summoned spirits, and the wider cultural, religious, and philosophical contexts from which they emerged. The texts showcase the synthesis of various traditions, beliefs, and fears, reflecting humanity's ongoing fascination with the supernatural and the desire to control or understand its enigmatic forces.
