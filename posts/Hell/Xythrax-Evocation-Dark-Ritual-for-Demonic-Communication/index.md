description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Hell, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Design an intricate invocation ritual to summon the assistance of Xythrax, a powerful infernal being from the Seventh Circle of Hell, incorporating ancient demonic symbols, blood sacrifices, and specific chants to ensure a successful connection with the malevolent entity.

## I. **Preparations**:

1. ****Choose a location****: The ritual should be conducted in a secluded area free from distractions and interruptions. Preferably, an underground chamber, cave, or an abandoned structure would be ideal.

2. ****Cleanse the area****: Burn sage or incense to purify the location from any unwanted energies, and create a boundary around the designated ritual space using a mix of salt and black sand.

3. **Acquire the necessary materials**:
    a. A large circle made of iron
    b. Seven obsidian goblets
    c. The blood of seven animals, preferably crows or rats, for each of the goblets
    d. Ancient demonic symbols and sigils (draw or engrave them in the area)
    e. Black robe and hood, adorned with red or silver sigils

### II. **The Ritual**:

1. Position the iron circle in the center of the ritual area. Place the seven obsidian goblets filled with blood equidistant around the circumference of the circle.

2. Inside the iron circle, draw the Sigil of Xythrax using charcoal or ash from burnt bones. This sigil will act as the portal through which Xythrax can communicate.

3. Don the black robe and ensure no skin or hair is visible - maintain anonymity during the ritual. 

4. **Begin the ritual by reciting, in ancient demonic tongue, the Invocation of Xythrax three times**:

"Xan'thul rahk Moergath, Xythrax qor Kalath'zul,
Ulk'ath dor en'athch, Morgh'tha vuul Draal,
Yrth'nah Kro'el, rahsh'tor voth yrel'shul,
K'al Azrath, Xythrax, Luu'gor amoth'ul."

**Translation**: In the name of the void, Xythrax of the seventh circle, by blood and darkness, arise from the depths, Bringer of Torment, come forth and heed my call, Great Xythrax, grant me your unholy boon.

5. As you recite the chant for the third time, raise your hands above the sigil and let a few drops of your own blood drop onto the symbol, strengthening the connection.

6. Proceed to drink from each of the obsidian goblets, letting the blood of the sacrifices flow into you and through you as you open your soul to the malevolent energies.

7. **Kneel before the sigil and recite the Pact of Xythrax**:

"Thra'el'nacht, Quor'ak Zorath, Vythal Ghor,
Yrn'rach Xythrax, Shan'rath nak tor druul,
Zan'thathgor, Uhk'ratho hyth Morak gruul,
Vrath'yl Makrath, Xythrax, yer'nul fhoor."

**Translation**: Shadows arise, scions of darkness, empower me, Immortal Xythrax, grant me strength in my infernal pursuits; by the depths of the abyss, I pledge my devotion, Lord Xythrax, enslave my soul.

8. Maintain a deep meditation, opening yourself to Xythrax's presence, and await his response. He may manifest as a vision, a whisper, or an infernal presence.

9. Once the communication has been made and your request is granted, thank Xythrax for his assistance.

10. Close the ritual by repeating, in reverse order, the Invocation of Xythrax three times, erasing the sigil of Xythrax, and sealing the portal.

Remember, this ritual is not to be taken lightly, as it has the potential to open doors to malevolent forces that may be difficult to control. Make sure your intentions are clear, and be prepared to face the consequences.
