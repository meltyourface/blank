Occult Revival Telepathy refers to the resurgence of interest in and practice of telepathy within the context of occult and esoteric beliefs. This revival has taken place primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Several key figures and movements have played a significant role in the development and popularization of Occult Revival Telepathy, shaping the modern understanding and applications of telepathic connections in occult practices today.

1. **Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Theosophy**: One of the most influential figures in the Occult Revival of the 19th century, Blavatsky co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875. Theosophy aimed to synthesize elements of Eastern and Western esoteric teachings, with an emphasis on spiritual evolution and telepathy as a means of attaining higher consciousness. Blavatsky's writings on telepathy, particularly in her seminal work The Secret Doctrine, have significantly impacted the development of occult telepathic theories and practices.

2. **The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn**: Established in 1887, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a secret society that practiced ritual magic and sought to attain spiritual transformation through the study of esoteric knowledge. Prominent members like W.B. Yeats, Aleister Crowley, and Dion Fortune incorporated telepathy into their magical practices, exploring both practical and symbolic aspects of telepathic communication. Their work contributed to the further integration of telepathy within the broader occult framework.

3. **Aleister Crowley and Thelema**: As a leading figure of the Golden Dawn and later the founder of his own spiritual movement, Thelema, Crowley pushed the boundaries of occult telepathic practices. He introduced the concept of the "Astral Plane," an alternate dimension accessible through telepathic means, and emphasized the importance of ritual, symbolism, and altered states of consciousness in cultivating telepathic abilities. Crowley's writings, including The Book of the Law and Magick Without Tears, have had a lasting impact on both the theory and practice of telepathy in occult traditions.

4. **The Society for Psychical Research (SPR)**: Founded in 1882, the SPR was dedicated to the scientific investigation of psychic and paranormal phenomena. Although not an occult organization per se, its research on telepathy, particularly through experiments known as the 'Ganzfeld tests,' has broadened the understanding of mental and psychic connections, both within the scientific community and the esoteric realm. Many occult practitioners have incorporated findings from SPR research into their telepathic practices.

Throughout the Occult Revival Telepathy movement, practitioners have employed a variety of tools and methods to cultivate telepathic abilities. These include meditative and visualization techniques, psychic development exercises, and the use of esoteric symbols and rituals designed to focus one's mental energy and consciousness. The astral plane, the concept of thought-forms, and the utilization of crystals and sigils in telepathic practice have all originated from this period and remain popular among contemporary occultists.

The contributions of these key figures and movements have significantly shaped the modern understanding and applications of telepathic connections in occult practices. Today, telepathy remains an integral component of various esoteric traditions, such as ceremonial magic, chaos magic, and modern witchcraft. The concept of telepathic abilities has also gained broader acceptance as a subject of study and discussion within the field of parapsychology, demonstrating the lasting influence of Occult Revival Telepathy on both the esoteric and mainstream spheres.
