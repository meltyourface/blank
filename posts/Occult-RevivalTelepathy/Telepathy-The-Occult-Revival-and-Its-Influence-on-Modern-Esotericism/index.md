The Occult Revival refers to the resurgence of interest in esoteric, occult, and mystic beliefs in the Western world during the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century. The period saw the emergence of numerous secret societies, fraternal orders, and alternative spiritual movements that sought to rediscover and integrate secret knowledge and ancient wisdom into contemporary thinking.

Historical Influences:

1. **The Spiritualist Movement**: The growing interest in spiritualism during the late 19th century provided the backdrop for the Occult Revival. Connecting with the afterlife and communication with non-physical entities led to a resurgence of interest in psychic abilities, with telepathy being an important aspect.

2. **The Theosophical Society**: Founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky, Henry Steel Olcott, and William Quan Judge, this organization aimed to investigate and promote the synthesis of science and ancient teachings with spiritual principles. The society's extensive work on the astral plane, thought transference, and consciousness further popularized telepathy as a serious subject of study.

Symbolism and Pivotal Figures:

1. **Helena Blavatsky**: As a founder of the Theosophical Society and author of The Secret Doctrine, Blavatsky was instrumental in popularizing spiritualism and broadly contributed to the Occult Revival. Her writings often mentioned the concept of the "Akashic Records" - a compendium of all human knowledge and experience, which implied the possibility of thought transference.

2. **Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung**: While primarily known for their groundbreaking work in psychology, both Freud and Jung also had interests in the occult and broadly contributed to its resurgence. They explored the potential for telepathy, with Jung even conducting telepathy experiments to investigate the phenomenon.

3. **Society for Psychical Research (SPR)**: Formed in 1882, this organization aimed to scientifically research psychic phenomena, with telepathy being a central area of investigation. Pivotal figures within the SPR, such as psychical researchers Frederick W. H. Myers and Edmund Gurney, carried out experiments and studies to understand the nature of telepathy and its potential applications.

The multidimensional context in which these elements coalesce can be understood through the combining of traditional spiritual beliefs with modern scientific inquiry. The quest to better comprehend the human mind and its potential abilities led to numerous studies and experiments, creating a solid foundation for future investigations.

Influence on Modern Esotericism and Future Developments:

Today, telepathy continues to be a subject of interest in esoteric circles and even scientific research. The evolution of consciousness studies has seen a revival of interest in telepathy as a potential human ability. Parapsychology – the scientific study of paranormal phenomena – has incorporated telepathy among its subjects, further validating its significance within the esoteric field. Although still a controversial topic with many skeptics, the ongoing research into consciousness and quantum entanglement could potentially uncover new aspects of telepathy and its relation to the human mind.

In summary, the Occult Revival period played an essential role in popularizing telepathy as a subject of interest within both esoteric and scientific investigations. Key historical influences, such as the Spiritualist Movement and the Theosophical Society, provided the groundwork for future studies and explorations. Symbolism emerged through the works of pivotal figures, such as Helena Blavatsky and Sigmund Freud, driving further interest in telepathy. These elements converged to develop the multidimensional context in which telepathy has become an essential aspect of modern esotericism, with future developments potentially validating the phenomenon and shedding new light on human consciousness.
