description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Psalms, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.

How long, O Lord, shall I toil in the shadows?
How long will this night befall my spirit?
How long before I see the break of day and be released from my suffering and turmoil?

I wander aimlessly through the abyss,
There is darkness in my bones, consuming me like the unforgiving night.

My heart bursts with lament, my spirit cries out like the owl in the forest.
Every day, the weight of worry grows heavier,
My mind flooded with questioning undiminished.

I beseech Thee, O Lord, God Almighty,
Reach out Thine hand and cast away the torrent of anguish that consumes me.

Have You forgotten me in this hour of need?
Do You not see the affliction poured upon me and my spirit cowering in despair?

My enemies, they taunt me; their laughter echoes in my ears like a venomous hiss.
They say, "Where is your God? Why does He not deliver you from this darkness?"

But I shall not heed their words, for I know Your love abounds, everlasting.
Rise, O Lord, and scatter these shadows that cling to my heart.

Do not let my enemies rejoice in my downfall,
For they shall not have the victory over me.

In faith, I will trust in Your enduring mercy,
In Your grace, I will find solace and refuge.

For even in the depths of despair and sorrow, Your presence is with me.
My heart shall sing once more the hymns of Your love and redemption.

Yea, in my darkest hour, I will rejoice,
For You, O Lord, are the keeper of my soul, and my salvation draws near.

In the quiet places of the heart, I will find You,
For You, O God, are my ever present sanctuary, my refuge and fortress.

Thus, I will lift my head from the shadows,
For hope springs eternal in You, my God, the deliverer of my soul.
