To fully answer this knowledge challenge, we must first establish an understanding of the key concepts and terms related to Ceremonial Magic, elemental forces, Watchtowers, Elemental Kings, and the concept of equilibrium. Firstly, let us define these terms before delving deeper into the relationships and roles of the elements within a magical circle.

**Ceremonial Magic**: Ceremonial Magic, also known as High Magic or Ritual Magic, is a comprehensive system of magical practices that incorporates symbols, rituals, and the invocation of higher spiritual beings for the purpose of achieving personal transformation, spiritual growth, and deeper insight into the mysteries of existence.

**Elemental Forces**: In the context of Ceremonial Magic, the four elemental forces are considered to be the foundational energies that make up the universe, namely, Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. Each element is associated with specific qualities, attributes, and symbolism that are essential for understanding and working with the magical forces.

**Watchtowers**: The Watchtowers are a central concept in Ceremonial Magic and refer to the four cardinal points in a magical circle, which are associated with the four elemental forces. They represent the protective boundaries of the circle and are considered to be portals that enable the magician to channel and communicate with the elemental and spiritual forces with a balanced and harmonious approach.

**Elemental Kings**: The Elemental Kings are personifications of the raw elemental forces and are considered to be powerful spiritual entities within the system of Ceremonial Magic. They are responsible for governing and controlling the elemental energies and are usually invoked and honored during magical rituals to maintain harmony and equilibrium within the elemental forces.

**Equilibrium**: In the context of the philosophy of Ceremonial Magic, equilibrium refers to the harmonious balance between the elemental forces and the individual's experience of reality. It emphasizes the importance of achieving a stable balance between the different aspects of one's life and spiritual practice, and it is considered a necessary condition for the successful execution of magical work.

Now, let's discuss the roles and relationships of the four elemental forces in the construction and application of the Watchtowers within a Ceremonial Magical circle and their connection to the Elemental Kings and the philosophical concept of equilibrium.

1. Fire: Fire is associated with the South and represents the transformative, active, and energetic aspect of the magical circle. It is symbolized by the qualities of willpower, creativity, and passion. The Fire element is related to the Elemental King Djinn (also known as Ghob), who oversees the element's spiritual aspects and governs its transformative power. By working with the Fire element and the King Djinn within the magical circle, the magician aims to harness the transformative power of Fire, enhancing their own creativity, will, and self-expressionâ€”while maintaining a balanced presence within the circle.

2. Water: Water corresponds to the West in a magical circle and is symbolic of the receptive, emotional, and purifying aspects of elemental forces. Water represents feelings, intuition, and reflection and is connected to the Elemental King Nicksa (or Nixsa), who governs the spiritual aspects of the Water element. By invoking the Water element and honoring King Nicksa, the magician seeks to cleanse emotions and thoughts, connect with their intuitive powers, and facilitate the flow of emotions in a balanced way within the circle.

3. Air: The Air element is linked to the East and signifies the intellectual, communicative, and spiritual aspects of the elements. It is associated with the mind, intellect, and communication and is connected to the Elemental King Paralda, who oversees the spiritual components of the Air element. In communicating with the Air element and King Paralda, the magician aims to sharpen their intellect, enhance their capacity to communicate effectively, and foster spiritual growth, while ensuring that these aspects remain in equilibrium with the other elements.

4. Earth: Earth is related to the North in the magical circle and represents the stabilizing, grounding, and material aspects of the elements. It symbolizes physicality, grounding, and practicality, and is governed by the Elemental King Ghob (or Gob). By working with the Earth element and King Ghob, the magician seeks to establish a firm grounding in their physical reality, develop practical and resourceful prowess, and build strong foundations while maintaining the balance between the spiritual and physical aspects of their practice.

In conclusion, the roles and relationships of the four elemental forces in the construction and application of the Watchtowers within a Ceremonial Magical circle are crucial for maintaining a balanced and harmonious working environment for the magician. These elemental forces are connected to the Elemental Kings, who assist in governing and controlling their respective energies. By invoking and honoring these forces and kings, the magician ensures the proper functioning of the Watchtowers, which aids in achieving personal and spiritual growth while maintaining the philosophical concept of equilibrium. Thus, balance between the elemental forces and harmony with their spiritual overseers are essential aspects of successful Ceremonial Magic practice.
