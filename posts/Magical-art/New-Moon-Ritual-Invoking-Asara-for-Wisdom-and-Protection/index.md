I present to you a ritualistic incantation designed to evoke the divine avatar Asara, the Mistress of Hidden Knowledge, to seek her wisdom, protection, and guidance. Please note that this ritual should be performed with utmost care and respect for the powerful forces it sets into motion.

**Incantation**:

In the blackest hour of the New Moon,
When the celestial bodies aid my pursuit,
And the sacred night embraces the Earth from the astral plane,
I call upon the divine avatar Asara, the Mistress of Hidden Knowledge!

By the sacred symbols of Seshet, the deific scribe,
And the eternal power of the Ankh,
I trace the eldritch lines of your cosmic signature,
And invoke the esoteric language of Ra's primordial utterance.

Asara, great goddess of the astral realms,
Whose wisdom stretches from Earth to the celestial vault,
I beseech you to heed my humble call!
Descend from your astral throne,
And grace my sanctum with your hallowed presence.

For the express purpose of seeking your wisdom,
To unveil the mysteries of eternity,
And to fortify my spirit with your protection and guidance,
I submit myself to your divine will.

Upon the sacred altar of gold and silver,
Strewn with the pungent essence of frankincense and myrrh,
I tender my offering in reverence of your majesty,
An amulet of lapis lazuli and garnet,
Engraved with the divine symbols of your celestial sovereignty.

With the sacred alignment of the planets in Capricorn,
And the invisible breath of the Dragons of Wisdom,
May the cosmic beacon of my invocation reach you,
And may your profound essence fill my spirit with light and truth.

O Asara, Mistress of Hidden Knowledge,
In your ecstatic presence,
I vow to serve the path of wisdom and truth,
And to respect the sanctity of the knowledge you bestow upon me.

So it is willed,
So it shall be.

It is essential to perform this ritual during the New Moon when the astrological alignment favors the earth's element, with planets positioned in Capricorn. The altar shall be adorned with the offerings mentioned, particularly an amulet of lapis lazuli and garnet with sacred symbols of Asara's celestial sovereignty. The ritual space must be cleansed and smudged with frankincense and myrrh beforehand to ensure energetic harmony and resonance with the divine avatar's potent energies.
