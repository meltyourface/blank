In order to compare and contrast the symbolic representations of three different magical systems within the magical art realm, I will analyze the symbols used in the Hermetic Qabalah, the Celtic Paganism, and the Tarot system. Examining how these symbols can be integrated into a piece of artwork will allow me to showcase the interconnectedness of these systems.

1. Hermetic Qabalah: The Hermetic Qabalah is a Western esoteric tradition rooted in Jewish Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Neoplatonism. The central structure of the Qabalah is the Tree of Life, composed of ten emanations called Sephiroth, connected by twenty-two paths. Each path is associated with a Hebrew letter and an aspect of the Tarot's Major Arcana. The Sephiroth are often color-coded and given an attributive quality known as a 'God name.' The Tree of Life represents an individual's journey toward spiritual enlightenment, with each Sephirah acting as a milestone in their spiritual development.

2. Celtic Paganism: Celtic Paganism is a polytheistic religious system that encompasses various mythologies and spiritual practices from Celtic cultures. A primary symbol in Celtic Paganism is the triquetra, a three-pointed, interlocking shape representing the interconnectedness of numerous aspects of life, including the mind, body, and spirit. Also, the Celtic Knot is a common symbol in Celtic Paganism that usually takes the form of interwoven lines with no clear beginning or end. This symbol communicates the notion of eternity and the cyclical nature of life.

3. Tarot system: Tarot is a divination system that consists of 78 cards, split into the Major Arcana (22 cards) and the Minor Arcana (56 cards). The Major Arcana symbolizes significant life events, archetypes, or teachings, while the Minor Arcana represents aspects of daily life. Each card portrays a character or concept, with accompanying symbols that contain deep psychological and metaphysical meaning. The Tarot system is frequently used for personal introspection, divination, or as a basis for meditation and spiritual practice.

To integrate the symbolic representations of the Hermetic Qabalah, Celtic Paganism, and the Tarot system into a single piece of artwork, an artist may consider a few approaches. One possibility would be to depict the Tree of Life with the Celtic triquetra or knot at the core of each Sephirah, symbolizing the interconnectedness of the systems and the cyclical nature of existence. Each path connecting the Sephiroth could further incorporate the corresponding Major Arcana card from the Tarot system, showcasing the spiritual journey the practitioner embarks on through the study of these symbols.

Another option would be to construct a mandala-like design where the Tarot's Major Arcana cards are arranged in a circle, surrounding a central Celtic knot or triquetra. The paths of the Tree of Life could then be illustrated spiraling from the center to connect each Major Arcana card. This imagery can reinforce the idea that all magical systems are woven together, creating a potent and holistic approach to personal and spiritual development.

In conclusion, the symbolic representation of the Hermetic Qabalah, Celtic Paganism, and the Tarot system are distinct yet interconnected within the realm of the magical art. By examining each system's symbols and combining them into a piece of artwork, a practitioner can gain an enriched understanding of the common threads woven through each tradition. This integrated approach can broaden their horizons, enabling deeper insights and an enhanced appreciation of these magical systems' interconnectedness as pathways toward personal growth and spiritual development.
