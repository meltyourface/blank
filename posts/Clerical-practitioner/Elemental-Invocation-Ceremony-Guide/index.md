1. Types of Elementals:

The types of elementals we will invoke in this personalized ceremony are Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. The unique attributes of each elemental category are as follows:

- Air Elementals: Known as Sylphs, they represent the intellectual, creative, and communicative aspects. They may bring clarity of mind or help manifest ideas.
- Fire Elementals: Known as Salamanders, they symbolize passion, transformation, and willpower. They may ignite motivation or bring courage during challenging times.
- Water Elementals: Known as Undines, they embody the aspects of love, healing, and emotions. They may help one heal emotional wounds or enhance empathic abilities.
- Earth Elementals: Known as Gnomes, they represent grounding, stability, and material needs. They may help improve finances or instate a sense of stability and security.

2. Procedure to Summon Elementals:

- Step 1: Cleansing and consecrating the sacred space – Cleanse the chosen area with salt and water, followed by consecrating the area by burning sage or frankincense. Envision a protective barrier surrounding the space.
- Step 2: Ritual tools and symbols – Arrange the ritualistic tools: ceremonial knife (athame), elemental symbols (pentacles, air-drawn symbols, or glyphs representing the elementals), and incense (specific to each elemental). Air: lavender, Fire: cinnamon, Water: jasmine, Earth: patchouli.
- Step 3: Protection and grounding – Meditate to ground yourself and visualize a shield of white light surrounding you. Call upon your guardian spirits or protective deities to guard you during the summoning process.

3. Ritual Components:

- Step 1: Circle casting – Cast a circle using your athame or a wand, starting in the east (Air), moving south (Fire), west (Water), and ending in the north (Earth). Chant appropriate blessings for each direction and elemental with each casting, such as "I call upon the Sylphs of the East for wisdom and understanding."
- Step 2: Elemental Invocations – Within the appropriate cardinal direction, chant your chosen invocation, for example: "I summon the powers of Air, my mind keen and swift. By the winds of change, I call upon the Sylphs!" Repeat for the other elementals.
- Step 3: Focus your intention – Meditate upon your specific purpose and visualize the intended outcome. Connect with the summoned elementals and share your intention. 

4. Communication and Control of Elementals:

- Step 1: Respect and commanding demeanor – Address summoned elementals with respect but maintain a commanding demeanor. Politely stating, "I request your aid and guidance."
- Step 2: Maintain clarity of intention – Keep your intention in mind and allow it to manifest through elemental energies, visualizing the energy flows from within.
- Step 3: Never demand – Instead, ask for assistance, and express gratitude upon completion.

5. Concluding the Invocation:

- Step 1: Thanking Elementals – Sincerely thank the elementals for their assistance and presence, asking for their continued guidance.
- Step 2: Releasing Elementals – Release elemental energies back to their realms, stating: "Elementals of Air/Fire/Water/Earth, by the power of the universe, I release you to your domains." 
- Step 3: Closing circle – Follow the same process as casting, but this time envision a barrier dissolving. Thank the guardian spirits and protective energies.
- Step 4: Cleansing – Clear away ritual tools and cleanse the space again with salt-water and sage, ensuring the area is free from elemental residue.

This comprehensive ceremony will ensure a successful summoning, communication, and release of elemental entities, providing practitioners with an immersive and powerful experience in the art of elemental invocation.
