## Occult Influences and Beliefs in the Teachings of L. Ron Hubbard

### I. Introduction

Lafayette Ron Hubbard, commonly known as L. Ron Hubbard, was an influential author and the founder of the Church of Scientology. While his teachings primarily focus on the concepts of thetans, engrams, and the ultimate goal of spiritual enlightenment, there is an undercurrent of occult influences and beliefs that can be traced throughout Hubbard's work. Through the analysis of the origins of his ideas, the important concepts within his belief system, and the intersection between these beliefs and esoteric practices, one can gain a rich, engaging, and contextual understanding of occult influences in the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard.

### II. Origins of L. Ron Hubbard's Ideas

The foundations of L. Ron Hubbard's ideas can be traced back to his early exposure to Eastern philosophy, notably Buddhism and Hinduism. Additionally, he was heavily influenced by the early 20th-century Western occultist Aleister Crowley and his magickal order, the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO).

Crowley, often dubbed the "wickedest man in the world," was a prolific occultist, mystic, and writer. He developed a comprehensive system of magick known as Thelema, which emphasizes discovering and following one's true will. Many of Crowley's teachings, including various rituals, sex magick, and the use of altered states for spiritual purposes, are mirrored in Hubbard's own belief system and practices.

### III. Important Concepts within L. Ron Hubbard's Belief System

A key component of Hubbard's teachings is the concept of the thetan, which shares similarities to the idea of the human soul in traditional occult practices. The thetan is the individual's true spiritual self, also known as the "Operating Thetan," which can be developed through various Scientology practices, such as auditing and the use of the E-meter.

Another important aspect of Hubbard's belief system is the theory of engrams, which are traumatic memories stored in the physical mind. These engrams are similar to the concept of "samskaras" in Eastern philosophy, which refers to the impressions or imprints left on the subconscious mind by past experiences. Both engrams and samskaras are believed to influence a person's behavior and state of mind.

In his teachings, Hubbard also emphasized the use of symbolic visualizations and invocations, which are reminiscent of the rituals and practices espoused by both Eastern esotericism and Western occult traditions.

### IV. Intersection of Occult and Esoteric Practices with L. Ron Hubbard's Beliefs

There are several areas where the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard intersect with occult and esoteric practices. In his writings, there are hidden meanings and layers of symbolism, as seen in the concept of "Xenu," the galactic emperor who is central to Scientology's creation myth. This figure can be conceptualized as a representation of one's ego or the oppressive societal forces that hinder spiritual progression.

Hubbard's approach to achieving the state of "Clear" - a person free from the influence of engrams - carries parallels with the goal of spiritual alchemy, specifically the transformation of the "base" self into a more refined and spiritually enlightened state.

Furthermore, his techniques for auditing, reminiscent of both Eastern meditation practices and Western magickal rituals, serve to bridge the gap between the exoteric and esoteric aspects of the belief system, allowing the practitioner to tap into the subconscious mind and uncover hidden potential.

### V. Conclusion

Through a comprehensive exploration of L. Ron Hubbard's teachings, one can uncover the profound occult influences and beliefs that underlie the foundations of Scientology. From the profound symbolism and ritualistic practices embedded within Hubbard's work to the influence of Western magick and Eastern philosophy on his belief system, it becomes evident that the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard offer a rich tapestry of esoteric knowledge for the dedicated initiate to explore and discover. By understanding these connections, practitioners can gain a deeper appreciation of the intricate layers of meaning contained within the teachings and, ultimately, progress on their own path toward enlightenment.
