L. Ron Hubbard's creative narrative style and thematic elements in both his science fiction and non-fiction writings were significantly influenced by early pulp fiction, particularly the works of H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Robert E. Howard. 

Hubbard was a prolific author during the golden age of pulp fiction, contributing stories to various pulp magazines. He was a contemporary of Lovecraft, Burroughs, and Howard, and their works were particularly influential on his style and themes. 

In Hubbard's science fiction works, such as "Battlefield Earth" and the "Mission Earth" series, we can easily identify elements borrowed from these earlier authors. The grandiose scale of Hubbard's universe and detailed descriptions of alien races and worlds are reminiscent of the sprawling worlds and rich mythology found in Burroughs' "John Carter of Mars" series and Howard's "Conan the Barbarian" stories. These elements served to engage readers in a similar manner, immersing them in action-packed adventures with complex characters and settings.

In terms of character development, it is not difficult to see the similarities between Hubbard's protagonists and the larger-than-life heroes of authors such as Lovecraft, Burroughs, and Howard. For instance, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, the hero of "Battlefield Earth," demonstrates physical prowess, exceptional intelligence, and indomitable willpower, much like Howard's Conan and Burroughs' John Carter. 

Furthermore, we can see how Hubbard was inspired by the cosmic horror of H. P. Lovecraft. Hubbard's sparse use of supernatural elements and incorporation of horror into his narratives has clear parallels to Lovecraft's macabre stories of cosmic forces threatening humanity. For example, the powerful alien races in "Battlefield Earth" and the "Mission Earth" series are reminiscent of Lovecraft's otherworldly Great Old Ones.

While these elements are more apparent in Hubbard's fiction works, we can also observe the influence of early pulp fiction on his non-fiction writing, such as "Dianetics." "Dianetics" is often regarded as a science fiction-like work due to its presentation of the human mind as an enigma that can be unraveled and controlled, much like the fantastical concepts found in pulp fiction narratives.

Hubbard's engagement with the pulp fiction community played a key role in shaping his approach to storytelling and the development of Scientology. The synergistic relationships and lively discussions with his pulp contemporaries may have inspired the fundamentals of Scientology's belief system. For instance, the idea of a person being an eternal spiritual being, or "thetan," might be derived from Lovecraft's pantheon of timeless cosmic entities. Similarly, the idea of past lives and reincarnation could have found inspiration in the many lives of Burroughs' John Carter.

Pulp fiction's emphasis on extraordinary heroes and supernatural powers may have influenced Hubbard's conceptualization of the "Bridge to Total Freedom" and Scientology's distinctive hierarchy of Operating Thetan levels. These ideas can be seen as an extension of the formulaic character development routines found in pulp adventure stories.

In conclusion, the mastery of L. Ron Hubbard's creative narrative style and thematic elements can be traced back to the early pulp fiction works of H. P. Lovecraft, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Robert E. Howard. These influences can be seen in the structure, characters, and concepts in his fiction and non-fiction works, including "Dianetics," "Battlefield Earth," and the "Mission Earth" series. Additionally, his engagement with the pulp fiction community may have directly or indirectly affected the development of Scientology and its core beliefs, creating a unique blend of science fiction, philosophy, and spirituality.
