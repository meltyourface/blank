  To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, we will begin by examining L Ron Hubbard's "Wall of Fire" revelation and understanding its significance. Then, we will explore the connection between the core principles of Scientology and "Wall of Fire," the influence of Thelema on L Ron Hubbard's work, and lastly, the implications for the spiritual ascension of Scientology adherents.
  
  I. L Ron Hubbard's "Wall of Fire" Revelation
  
  Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, or L Ron Hubbard, was an American author, philosopher, and the founder of the Church of Scientology. In 1967, Hubbard revealed that he had made a groundbreaking discovery during his research on human spirituality, which he called the "Wall of Fire" or Incident II. This revelation came during a period in which Hubbard was actively researching the past, particularly past traumas, and how it could affect an individual's spiritual well-being.
  
  The "Wall of Fire" refers to an extraterrestrial event that happened 75 million years ago, involving a galactic tyrant named Xenu who, to address overpopulation, gathered billions of beings, placed them in volcanoes on Earth (then called Teegeeack). He then detonated hydrogen bombs in these volcanoes, which ultimately killed the beings but released their souls, termed as "thetans."
  
  These displaced thetans, Hubbard believed, eventually began to attach themselves to human bodies, causing various negative emotions or traumas, which he called 'engrams.' Clearing these engrams became the focal point for spiritual progress in the Church of Scientology.
  
  II. Intertwinement of "Wall of Fire" with Core Principles of Scientology
  
  At the core of Scientology principles is the belief in the immortal nature of the human spirit or thetan and its quest to overcome the negative influences caused by past traumas or engrams accumulated over successive lives. The "Wall of Fire" event is deeply interconnected with these principles.
  
  First, it provides a cosmological explanation for the presence of engrams in individuals. According to Hubbard's revelation, these spiritual entities are the remnants of a primordial catastrophe that has haunted humanity since its inception. By acknowledging and confronting this event, adherents of Scientology work towards freeing themselves from the negative influences of engrams.
  
  Second, the "Wall of Fire" event reinforces the importance of the "Auditing" process, which is a major practice in Scientology that involves one-on-one counseling sessions aimed at uncovering and addressing past traumas. By discovering, confronting, and ultimately canceling the negative influences of engrams in each individual, Scientologists can achieve a higher state of spiritual freedom and enlightenment called "Clear."
  
  III. Influence of Thelema on Hubbard's Work
  
  Thelema, a now-modern spiritual practice rooted in ancient Egyptian and Western esoteric mysticism, was founded by the English occultist Aleister Crowley. There are some apparent parallels between Scientology and Thelema, such as the idea of uniting the microcosm with the macrocosm and the quest for spiritual independence and sovereignty.
  
  It is speculated that L Ron Hubbard may have been influenced by Aleister Crowley's work, which played a role in formulating various aspects of the Scientology system. While the degree of direct influence is open to debate, it is evident that both philosophies share similarities and common themes like spiritual empowerment, self-discovery, and a transformational journey guided by the individual's will.
  
  IV. Implications for the Spiritual Ascension of Scientology Adherents
  
  The "Wall of Fire" revelation has profound implications for the spiritual ascension of Scientology adherents. It indicates that, by uncovering and resolving the impacts of the ancient Incident II, an individual can achieve spiritual growth and self-understanding. As a result, spiritual progress in Scientology is intrinsically linked with the process of identifying, confronting, and rising above the challenges imposed by past events like the "Wall of Fire."
  
  In conclusion, L Ron Hubbard's "Wall of Fire" revelation is a vital element in the Church of Scientology's belief system. It intertwines with the core principles of Scientology, illuminates the possible influence of esoteric belief systems like Thelema, and highlights the importance of spiritual ascension through understanding and overcoming one's past traumas and limitations.
