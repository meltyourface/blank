## Journey to the Cosmic Light: Astral Travel Guided Meditation

Introduction

Welcome, dear traveler, to this guided meditation designed for astral travel, harnessing the Cosmic Light of Creation. Throughout this journey, we will focus on specific visualization techniques, chakra alignment, and sacred geometry symbols, to enhance your connection with the universal cosmic energy.

Please find a comfortable seated or lying position, take a deep breath, and close your eyes. Let your body and mind relax into the present moment.

Chakra Alignment

Begin by bringing your awareness to the base of your spine, your root chakra. Envision a bright red light gently pulsating with each breath, grounding you and connecting to the Earth.

Now, slowly move your focus to the sacral chakra, located below your navel. See a vibrant orange light, radiating warmth and creativity.

Next, bring your attention to your solar plexus, envisioning a powerful yellow light, offering confidence and personal power.

Allow the energy to rise to your heart chakra, the center of your chest. Feel the green light, enveloping in love and compassion.

Continuing upward to your throat chakra, imagine a brilliant blue light, giving you the ability to communicate clearly and authentically.

Entering the realm of intuition, focus on your third eye chakra, located on your forehead. Visualize an indigo light, enhancing your intuition, wisdom, and foresight.

Finally, shift your awareness to the crown chakra at the top of your head. Imagine a magnificent violet light, connecting you to the universe's infinite wisdom and the Cosmic Light of Creation.

Sacred Geometry Visualization

Now that your chakras are aligned, let's visualize the Flower of Life, a sacred geometric shape consisting of evenly spaced, overlapping circles. Picturing it in front of you, see it expand and contract with each breath, emanating a powerful, divine energy.

Focus on the interconnectedness of the circles, representing the interconnectedness of all life.

Astral Travel Preparation

Breathing deeply, envision your astral body—a silvery, luminescent version of yourself—rising from your physical form. Feel the lightness, as you begin to effortlessly float upward.

As you continue to rise, you find yourself entering through a golden gateway, a portal to the higher realms and the Cosmic Light of Creation. Allow yourself to be drawn to its pull, embracing the journey ahead.

Encounter with Interdimensional Beings

In this higher realm, embrace the presence of interdimensional beings, appearing to you in a form you can understand and feel comfortable with. Ask them for guidance and wisdom, to help you deepen your spiritual journey.

Listen deeply as they impart their knowledge and share their insights. Feel a strong sense of interconnectedness, knowing that you, too, are part of this vast cosmic network.

Customized Astral Travel Experiences

To deepen the astral travel experience, select one of these paths, customized for various spiritual levels:

1. Connect with Past Lives: Journey through time, exploring past lifetimes, discovering the knowledge and experiences carried within your soul.

2. Visit the Akashic Records: Access the universal library of knowledge, where every thought, action, and event is recorded. Seek wisdom and insight into your life's purpose and soul's mission.

3. Attend the Healing Temples: Experience deep healing by immersing yourself in magnificent temples of light, offering energy work, vibrational therapy, and spiritual restoration.

Ending the Journey

Having completed your astral travel experience, express gratitude toward the interdimensional beings and the Cosmic Light of Creation. Feel the lightness in your being, a sense of accomplishment, and a renewed connection to the universe.

Begin to slowly bring your awareness back to your astral body, rejoining your physical form. Feel the energy from your chakra alignment and sacred geometry continuing to pulse through your body.

Take a deep breath, savoring this moment, and gently open your eyes.

Conclusion

You have now completed your astral travel guided meditation, harnessing the Cosmic Light of Creation. Carry the insights and connections you have made today with you, integrating them into your daily life for personal growth and spiritual development.
