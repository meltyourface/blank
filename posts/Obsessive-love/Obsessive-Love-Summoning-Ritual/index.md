Incantation

Begin by standing in front of the prepared altar, surrounded by amaranthine symbols and candles representing eternal flames, in a room adorned with images of the love deity.
**Step 1**: Hand gestures
- Extend both arms outwards, palms facing upwards.
- Slowly move your hands together in a swirling motion, as if you were stirring a whirlpool of love.
- Make a heart shape with your fingers and thumbs, and hold it in front of your chest.
**Step 2**: Vocal pitches
- Start by humming at a low, resonant pitch, gradually escalating in both volume and frequency.
- As you reach the apex of the crescendo, let out a powerful, passionate cry, symbolizing the intensity of the love you wish to summon.
**Step 3**: Latin phrases
Recite the following Latin phrases with fervor and unwavering passion, while maintaining the heart-shaped hand gesture:

- "Amor aeternus ignis ardet" (Eternal love's fire burns)
- "Obsessio cordis mei pulsare" (Obsession makes my heart beat)
- "Deus amoris eius captus" (God of obsessive love, I am captive)
**Step 4**: Rare ingredients
- Delicately place the petals of a moonlit night-blooming jasmine around the altar, forming a circle.
- With great care, gather the tears of an impassioned lover and pour them into a crystal chalice.
**Step 5**: Invocation
- Hold the chalice of tears above your head, close your eyes, and take a deep breath.
- Recite the final summoning incantation: "Dea amoris obsidiōnis, te invoco! Audi vocem meam, sentire ardorem cordis mei et huc venire!" (Deity of obsessive love, I summon thee! Hear my voice, feel the ardor of my heart, and come forth!)
**Step 6**: Offerings and completion
- Slowly lower the chalice and place it on the altar, presenting it to the deity as an offering.
- Bow your head and recite a final, heartfelt plea: "O dea amoris, adiuva me! In tua praesentia, amor obsidiōnis florere!" (Oh goddess of love, aid me! In your presence, may obsessive love flourish!)

The atmosphere should now be charged with the palpable energy of obsessive love, as the deity is drawn towards your ardent devotion and passionate invocation. Remain focused and open to the divine presence, for the love deity's enchantment will soon weave its way into your life.
