In order to thoroughly answer this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the different layers that comprise the topic. These include the concepts of esotericism, dimensions of love, the symbiotic relationship within the framework of obsessive love, and how these affect an individual's journey towards self-discovery and higher consciousness. Throughout this response, we will dissect each component, analyze their links, and assess the potential impact of such a dynamic on one's path to self-awareness.

First and foremost, it is crucial to define the term "esotericism." In the context of this answer, esotericism refers to a system of thought, practice, and spirituality that delves into hidden, inner, and mystical aspects of existence beyond the realm of mundane or surface-level understanding. Within this esoteric framework, there are various dimensions of love, including but not limited to romantic and platonic love, universal love, self-love, and divine love. Each type of love contributes to our overall understanding of the emotion and shapes our spiritual journey.

With these clarifications in mind, we can now delve into the symbiotic relationship between the psyche, spiritual growth, and obsessive love. Obsessive love, in its simplest definition, refers to an overwhelming, all-consuming passion or desire for another individual, often to the point of behavioral and emotional imbalances. It is important to note that although obsessive love often creates harmful results, its roots in the intensity and singularity of focus within the individual's psyche can be illuminating for the spiritual journey.

When analyzing the interaction between the psyche and obsessive love, we must look at the subconscious. Obsessive love can stem from various underlying psychological factors, such as childhood trauma, attachment patterns, or the inherent drive to merge with another's essence. These factors can influence one's spirituality and become catalysts for increased self-awareness or spiritual deterioration, depending on the individual's outlook and emotional resilience.

Spiritual growth has both direct and indirect connections to obsessive love. On one hand, the experience of obsessive love can serve as a potent initiator to embark on a spiritual journey, as the intense emotions and attraction to the object of one's obsession can be seen as a yearning for the divine, the sublime, or a glimpse of our true selves. This dynamic can push an individual to seek deeper meaning beyond the superficial layers of existence.

On the other hand, spiritual growth can be hindered by obsessive love when it becomes addictive, exploitative, or codependent. Obsessive love's nature has the potential to create an unhealthy entanglement of energy between the involved parties, binding them to each other in toxic ways rather than fostering a nourishing and harmonious connection.

To complete our answer to this challenge, we now turn to the impact of this symbiotic relationship on an individual's journey towards self-discovery and attainment of higher consciousness. Due to its highly subjective nature, obsessive love has wildly differing consequences for different people. For some, the intense emotions drive them to learn deeper wisdom and truths about themselves and the world, while others might be consumed by the destructive aspects of their obsession, leading to stagnation or regression in their spiritual evolution.

To summarize, the symbiotic relationship between the psyche, spiritual growth, and obsessive love is intricate and multidimensional. This dynamic thoroughly explores the core of human emotions, the depths of the subconscious mind, and their essential links to the process of spiritual awakening. The influence of obsessive love on an individual's spiritual trajectory may vary, ultimately depending on their capacity to transform these intense emotions into a catalyst for growth and self-discovery. For this reason, it is crucial for those embarking on spiritual journeys to be vigilant in their self-reflection and maintain balance within their psychological and emotional states to harness the enriching elements of love for the greater good.
