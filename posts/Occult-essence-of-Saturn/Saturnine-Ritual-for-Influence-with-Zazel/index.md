excerpt: > 
  Compose a detailed conjuration ritual to summon the spirit Zazel, incorporating the arcane knowledge and mystical symbolism associated with the Occult essence of Saturn. Ensure the ritual includes precise steps for constructing a sigil specific to Zazel, the appropriate planetary hours and correspondences for the invocation, and chants or invocations in an ancient language. Additionally, develop a method for harnessing the influence of Zazel's malefic energy to achieve a specific, complex intention within the practitioner's realm of influence.

## I. **Preparation for the Ritual**:

1. **Choose the ideal time**: Perform the ritual during one of the planetary hours of Saturn, preferably on a Saturday for maximum affinity. To calculate the planetary hours, use local sunrise and sunset times and divide the daylight and nighttime periods into 12 equal hours each. 

2. **Construct a sacred space**: Find a quiet, undisturbed area where you can perform the ritual without interruptions. Use a table or altar to place your ritual items. Cleanse the area by burning sage or incense (such as myrrh, patchouli, or cypress), and then begin by casting a circle around the space for protection against any unwanted energies.

3. **Attire**: Wear simple, dark-colored clothing or traditional ceremonial robes made of natural fibers, symbolizing your connection with the Earth and solemnity for the ritual.

### II. **Preparation of Ritual Items**:

1. **Sigil creation**: On a square piece of black or dark-colored paper, draw the sigil specific to Zazel, which is a horned serpent encircling the planetary symbol of Saturn: â™„. To energize the sigil, meditate over it and visualize the energy from Saturn flowing into the drawing. Optionally, anoint the sigil with oils of myrrh or patchouli.

2. **Planetary talisman**: Prepare a lead talisman engraved with the planetary symbol of Saturn and three lines of the ancient Aramaic script where the name "Zazel" is written repeatedly.

3. **Candles**: Arrange three black candles in a triangle formation around the circle. The black candles represent the binding of Zazel's energies to the intention of the ritual.

4. **Incense**: Prepare incense containing planetary herbs of Saturn, such as myrrh, cypress, or patchouli. Burn it as an offering to Zazel and to set the atmosphere for the ritual.

5. **Chalice**: Fill a chalice with red wine or dark liquid symbolizing the mysterious and transformative nature of Saturn.

### III. **The Ritual**:

1. **Beginning**: Before lighting the candles, stand in the circle and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths to center yourself. Meditate on the intention of the ritual, visualizing the outcome as clearly as possible.

2. **Lighting the candles**: Light the three black candles while reciting the following invocation in ancient Aramaic:

"Furbi qadisha, Zazel, qum b'shaim kudisha Saturnus!
(Sacred spirit, Zazel, arise in the holy name of Saturn!)"

3. **Circle casting**: With your dominant hand, trace the outline of the circle clockwise, envisioning a bright blue line of energy forming around the circle, all the while repeating:

"Qedesh qedesh, etsata d'khayil, Eqra espirit d'hayil shadin!"
(Holy holy, I summon you, powerful spirit of well-ten times!)

4. **Invocation of Zazel**: Holding the lead talisman and sigil in your hands, recite the following chant:

"Zazel agla darebush, raggelel am'anthur,
Maraclaya shagemyza, neshirazu Saturnus!
(Zazel, by your secret pathways, come from your dark dwelling,
I summon you by the authority of Saturn!)"

5. **Offerings**: Place the energized sigil and talisman on the altar, and offer the incense and chalice of wine to Zazel saying:

"Zazel, b'hayilah sh'mayim, qibel qurbanay v'sayadan li b'sodak!"
(Zazel, mighty spirit of the heavens, accept my offerings and aid me in your mysteries!)

6. **Harnessing the influence of Zazel**: State your specific, complex intention to Zazel, and request their assistance in achieving your goal. Visualize Zazel's energy intertwining with your own, helping you manifest your intention in the physical realm.

7. **Closing**: Express gratitude to Zazel for their guidance, and request that they depart, saying:

"Brikh, Zazel, haddir ba'amukim; malka d'elme, karev l'aitra!"
(Blessed be, Zazel, ruler of the depths; great celestial power, return to your abode!)

8. Extinguish the candles counterclockwise, and dismantle the circle by tracing it counterclockwise with your dominant hand, releasing the energy back into the universe.

After the ritual, dispose of the offerings and any other ritual items mindfully, and cleanse yourself and the area again. To continue using the sigil and talisman, keep them together on your altar or another sacred space, and meditate upon them regularly to maintain the connection with Zazel and their influence on your desired outcome.
