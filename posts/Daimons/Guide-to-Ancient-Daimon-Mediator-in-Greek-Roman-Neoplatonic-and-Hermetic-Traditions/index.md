Answer: To address this knowledge challenge, we must first provide context to the various belief systems mentioned, specifically ancient Greco-Roman, Neoplatonist, and Hermetic influences. These traditions serve as foundations for the formation of various esoteric and occult teachings. Within these traditions, the concept of the Daimon plays an essential role in guiding and facilitating the practitioner's spiritual ascent. We will consider the roles, purposes, and functions of the Daimon in these three distinct yet related philosophies and highlight the significance of theurgic practices and the understanding of multiple planes of reality within an individual's cosmic relationship.

The ancient Greco-Roman tradition considers the Daimon primarily as an intermediary being situated between the human and the divine. Often perceived as a guardian spirit, the Daimon serves to guide humans on their spiritual path and in their pursuit of wisdom and virtue. For the Greco-Roman individual, the Daimon played a significant role in their personal lives, providing guidance and protection throughout their life journey. These guardian spirits also served to help humans communicate with and experience the divine, recognizing the complexity of the cosmos and the connection between the myriad of spiritual beings at play within it.

Neoplatonism, founded by the philosopher Plotinus in the 3rd century, lies heavily on the concept of the One, the Good, or the Divine, which is considered the origin and the ultimate goal of existence. In this tradition, humans seek to attain unity with the ineffable, transcendent One by embarking on a spiritual ascent â€“ a pursuit of the self's purification and the contemplative quest for the divine. Within Neoplatonism, the Daimon plays an essential role as a mediator and guide. More specifically, as a manifestation of the individual's divine counterpart or higher self, the Daimon serves to connect the human soul with the higher realms and enables the individual to ascend through successive levels of being, ultimately leading the practitioner towards the One.

Hermeticism, born from the confluence of Hellenistic and Egyptian thought, is also concerned with the spiritual ascent and the unity with the divine. As in Neoplatonism, Hermetic practitioners recognize the existence of multiple planes of reality, ranging from the material to the celestial realms. In this framework, the Daimon is again seen as an intermediary being that assists the practitioner in traversing these varied planes. Through communication with the Daimon, the Hermetic initiate pursues the alchemical transformation of the self, acquiring knowledge and understanding that allow for greater spiritual insight and eventual union with the divine.

Theurgic practices, involving the usage of rituals, symbols, and other esoteric means, serve to facilitate communication with the Daimon and create a bridge between the human and celestial realms. These practices, such as invoking the presence of a Daimon, help align the practitioner with their higher spiritual self, allowing them to ascend into higher planes of consciousness and deepen their connection with the cosmos.

In summary, the role, purpose, and function of the Daimon in ancient Greco-Roman, Neoplatonist, and Hermetic traditions play a vital role in guiding the individual towards a spiritual ascent. As an intermediary being, the Daimon enables the individual to communicate with, experience, and ultimately unite with the ineffable, divine One. The importance of theurgic practices in these traditions cannot be overstated, allowing the practitioner to access a deeper understanding of the cosmos and their place within it. By recognizing and engaging with multiple planes of reality in one's cosmic relationship, the practitioner is better equipped to achieve spiritual fulfillment and purpose.
