description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Daimons, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Compose a meticulous incantation, imbued with arcane knowledge and eldritch power, specifically designed to expel and banish a particularly malevolent and insubordinate Daimon. Ensure that the incantation incorporates a complex series of sigils, correspondences, and ritualistic components, including the Daimon's true name, preferred offerings, and celestial affiliations. Craft the incantation in such a manner that it not only forces the unruly Daimon to retreat but also erects an impenetrable barrier to prevent its return.

Oh mighty forces, heed this call,
By ancient words and symbols tall,
I conjure now the skill and art,
To banish one who plays foul part.

Zalqea, wretched Daimon vile,
Your true name invoked this while,
Your wicked ways we will absolve,
As trembling earth and stars revolve.

Align the sigils, mark the ground,
Encompassed by a circle round,
Set as North, the bane of dread,
The heavy key, the heart of lead.

In East, a silver chalice raise,
To quench the fires of Zalqea's blaze,
Entwined within, vast webs of fate,
To bind the Daimon in its state.

The Southern point presents a pyre,
Of rosemary and blackthorn fire,
Tinged with mystic myrrh and sage,
To cleanse, dismiss, and disengage.

To West, bring forth the dagger wrought,
The edge of obsidian, finely sought,
With handle carved from sacred yew,
Empowered to slice the bonds it drew.

Now upward gaze, the heavens' clock,
The constellation of Archon's flock,
To mighty Ophis, celestial sign,
Give potency to this design.

In the depths below, the chthonic urn,
Echoes with torments yet to learn,
Where offerings of pomegranate seeds,
And ashes of vervain fill its needs.

With whispered wisdom, myriad strands,
We weave the spell by mortal hands,
As words take flight on winds and flame,
Zalqea's will, we now reclaim.

By sigils strong, by circle bound,
By ritual, incantation crowned,
We banish thee, thou malevolent,
And shield our realm, with firmament.

Zalqea, by true name and form,
No more our lives can you deform,
Expelled, dismissed, and barred you are,
By incandescent celestial star.

As we command, so mote it be,
Inexorable, unyielding decree,
Our will imposed, the dark undone,
In mastery, the battle won.
