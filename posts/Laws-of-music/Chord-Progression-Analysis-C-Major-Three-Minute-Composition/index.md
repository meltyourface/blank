description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Laws of music, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Design a chord progression for a three-minute composition, utilizing the circle of fifths in the context of Laws of music. Incorporate at least two secondary dominant chords and one borrowed chord from the parallel minor key, while ensuring the progression demonstrates a smooth transition between chords, balanced voice leading, and a logical harmonic structure. Additionally, create a brief analysis of the progression, outlining the use of tension and resolution, and the relationship between the chords.

Chord progression for a three-minute composition:

The composition is in the key of C major. We will adhere to a 4/4 time signature with a tempo of 90 BPM, assuming a total of 32 bars for the three-minute duration.

| C | A7 | Dm7 | G7 | Em7 | A7 | Dm7 | G7 |
| Fm6 | C | C  | G7 | C  | Ab7 | Eb6 | D7 |
| G7 | A7 | Dm7 | G7 | Em7 | A7 | Dm7 | G7 |
| C | E7 | Am7 | G7 | F  | Fm | C  | G7 |

Chord progression analysis:

The progression begins with the tonic chord, C, proceeding to A7, which is the secondary dominant of the Dm7 chord (II). Following the circle of fifths, we reach the G7 (V) and Em7 (III). This pattern repeats once more to create a sense of familiarity.

In the second 8 bars, we introduce a borrowed chord, Fm6, from the parallel minor key, allowing for a smooth transition to the C (I) and G7 (V). Ab7 (borrowed from the parallel minor scale) leads to Eb6 and then D7 creating tension, which is resolved by returning to G7 (V).

The third section of 8 bars is a reiteration of the opening I-VI-II-V-III-VI-II-V pattern, continuing the theme and solidifying the harmonic structure.

The final section begins with the tonic, C (I), and features the secondary dominant, E7, of the Am7 (VI). The progression then moves to G7 (V), transitioning to F (IV), Fm (borrowed iv), and resolving on C (I) before ending with G7 (V) to create the perfect cadence.

Throughout the piece, secondary dominants (A7, E7) create tension, leading to the resolution on their corresponding primary chords (Dm7, Am7). The borrowed chords (Fm6, Ab7, Fm) provoke interest and deepen the harmonic texture while adhering to the smooth voice leading and logical harmonic structure.
