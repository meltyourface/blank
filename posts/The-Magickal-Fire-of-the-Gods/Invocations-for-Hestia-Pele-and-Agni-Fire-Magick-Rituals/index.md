Invocation of Hestia:

By the hearth's warmth and the flickering flame,
I call upon Hestia, keeper of the sacred flame.
Goddess of the home, hear my plea,
Descend from Olympus and commune with me.

In this circle of light, may your essence entwine,
Guardian of the hearth, your wisdom divine.
Bless this place with warmth and tranquility,
Let the fire within burn with passion and stability.

In your wisdom and grace, may your magick ignite,
Empower my will by your fire's bright light.
Hestia, I honor you with this flame,
Guide me with love, in your divine name.

Sigil of Hestia: A simple depiction of a hearth with a burning flame inside, surrounded by a circle, representing the unity of home and the sacred bond of family.

Invocation of Pele:

Fiery goddess of molten earth,
Pele, from the volcanoâ€™s wrath, emerge and make thyself heard!
Your intensity and power, I seek to harness,
From deep beneath the ground, may your essence surface.

Unleash your raging tempest and forge my spirit anew,
As the volcano erupts, let the lava's strength imbue.
Elemental power, Pele, mix with my being,
Help me ascend and awaken through great volcanic cleansing.

Pele, by your presence, may I transform,
Unleash the force within, and allow my soul to perform.
Grant me passion and vision to envision my path,
With your magick, Pele, may I embody your fiery wrath.

Sigil of Pele: A stylized volcanic mountain emitting plumes of smoke and lava flows, enclosed within a geometric polygon, symbolizing the transformative power of the volcanic eruption and Pele's domain over the molten earth.

Invocation of Agni:

Agni, god of fire and eternal wisdom,
Bearer of light and protector of sacred rite.
Vedic deity, kindle within me the sacrificial flame,
Through your guidance, let truth and knowledge be my aim.

As the offering burns, your purifying presence invoked,
Agni, accept my plea and bring forth your fiery cloak.
Illuminate my path, lead me toward spiritual revelation,
Let your fires ignite insight and cosmic communication.

With your tongue of fire, consume illusion and deceit,
With your sacred presence, life's challenges, I shall meet.
Agni, god of fire, purify my soul this night,
In your divine embrace, grant me clarity and astral sight.

Sigil of Agni: A stylized depiction of a fire altar, with a central flame rising from its core, encompassed by the Sanskrit symbol of "A", which represents Agni. Surrounding the fire altar are three circles, symbolizing the divine trinity and Agni's guardianship over sacred rite.

With these invocations and sigils, the practitioner may summon the divine favor and energies of Hestia, Pele, and Agni from The Magickal Fire of the Gods pantheon, utilizing their individual gifts and communing with their divine essence in an intricately woven ritual of fire magick.
