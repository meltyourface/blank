To complete the task of invoking the primordial deities using the vibrational resonance of ancient sigils and the Sacred Language of the Magickal Fire of the Gods, I will outline a ritual procedure:

1. **Preparation**: Choose a location with strong elemental energies, preferably near an ancient site and during a time when the veil between worlds is considered thin. Ensure you have access to the chosen ancient sigils and knowledge of the sacred language of the Magickal Fire of the Gods.

2. **Mark the boundaries**: Designate your ritual space by marking a circle to provide protection while working with these powerful energies. Select elemental items, actions, or beings to represent each cardinal direction, calling upon the elemental guardians to guide and bear witness to the invocation.

3. **Opening invocation**: Call upon the Guardians of the Sacred Language, the Lords of the Magickal Fire of the Gods, and the Keepers of the Primordial Flame to join you in your ritual. Request their blessings and guidance, and permission to invoke the energy of the primordial deities.

4. **Ritual tools and attire**: Use ritual tools such as an athame, a wand, or a staff charged with focused energy to draw the selected ancient sigils, marking them in the air while vibrating the sacred mantras of the Magickal Fire of the Gods. Dress in ceremonial attire that supports your intent and consciousness.

5. **Activating the sigils**: Connect to the vibrational resonance of the sigils by chanting the ancient mantras that correspond with the specific deity. As you chant, visualize the sigil glowing and vibrating in an aura of divine energy, channeling the energy of the primordial deity.

6. **Invocation of primordial deities**: Using the Sacred Language of the Magickal Fire of the Gods, invoke the primordial deities through a dedicated invocation. Speak their names and powers aloud, inviting them into your ritual space, and ask for their presence, wisdom, and guidance.

7. **Receiving guidance and wisdom**: Take a moment to meditate and connect with the energies of the primordial deities that you have invoked. Be open to their guidance, receiving any insights, wisdom, or messages that they may have for you.

8. **Closing ceremony**: Thank the primordial deities for their presence, wisdom, and for sharing their powerful energies. Request their blessings and protection before allowing their energies to return to their domains. Also, thank the Guardians of the Sacred Language, the Lords of the Magickal Fire of the Gods and the elemental guardians before closing the circle.

9. **Grounding**: Take time to ground your energies and release any residual energies from the ceremony by connecting with the Earth and the elements. Enjoy a simple meal, listen to the sounds of nature, or engage in other activities that facilitate grounding.

Remember to maintain respect and reverence throughout this ritual, as you work with the Magickal Fire of the Gods and powerful primordial deities. Always ensure your intentions align with the highest good and are aimed at benefiting others and yourself on a spiritual level.
