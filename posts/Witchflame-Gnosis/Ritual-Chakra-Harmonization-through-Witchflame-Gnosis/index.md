## I. **Preparation**: Purification and Grounding

Before beginning, prepare the sacred space and ensure a safe, clear environment. This can be done through smudging with sage, meditative breathing, or casting a circle.

### II. **The Incantation of the Witchflame Gnosis**: Chakra Harmonization

Now, begin the incantation as you visualize the Witchflame energy activating within you. **Recite the following or create your own personalized incantation**:

By the power of Witchflame Gnosis, I invoke the essence of the universe,
Harmonize the sacred centers within, restore balance, serenity, and alignment,
Seven chakras kissed by mystical flame, transmute darkness and ignite each domain.
 
### III. Invocation of Each Chakra

1. **Root Chakra - Muladhara**:
Color correspondence: Red
"Flame of foundation, roots deep and true,
Awaken Muladhara, red is your hue,
Sigil of stability, eternal ground,
By this Witchflame, balance is found."

2. **Sacral Chakra - Svadhisthana**:
Color correspondence: Orange
"Creative fire, center of desire,
Ignite Svadhisthana, with passion inspire,
Sigil of fluidity, sensual drive,
By this Witchflame, harmoniously thrive."

3. **Solar Plexus Chakra - Manipura**:
Color correspondence: Yellow
"Flame of power, confidence and might,
Illuminate Manipura, with radiant yellow light,
Sigil of assertion, inner strength we claim,
By this Witchflame, personal power inflame."

4. **Heart Chakra - Anahata**:
Color correspondence: Green
"Verdant ember, compassion and heart,
Embrace Anahata, green love impart,
Sigil of unity, connection and trust,
By this Witchflame, dissolve all mistrust."

5. **Throat Chakra - Vishuddha**:
Color correspondence: Blue
"Flame of expression, truth, and word,
Clear Vishuddha, blue voice to be heard,
Sigil of clarity, blend silence with sound,
By this Witchflame, speak wisdom profound."

6. **Third Eye Chakra - Ajna**:
Color correspondence: Indigo
"Indigo fire, insight and sight,
Awaken Ajna, bring forth inner light,
Sigil of vision, open pathways unseen,
By this Witchflame, transcend and glean."

7. **Crown Chakra - Sahasrara**:
Color correspondence: Violet
"Violet blaze, divinity within,
Illuminate Sahasrara, transcend and begin,
Sigil of oneness, to cosmic connection,
By this Witchflame, achieve true perfection."

### IV. **Conclusion**: Sealing the Harmonization

After reciting the invocations, visualize the Witchflame energy sealing the harmonized chakras together:

"Unified by Witchflame's eternal grace,
Sealed and aligned, within sacred space,
Harmony restored, the balance maintained,
By the power of Witchflame, equilibrium sustained."

At this point, feel the completion of the harmonization process. Ground and center yourself, and thank the Witchflame Gnosis for its assistance. Release any excess energy into the Earth, and close the sacred space or circle. It is done.
