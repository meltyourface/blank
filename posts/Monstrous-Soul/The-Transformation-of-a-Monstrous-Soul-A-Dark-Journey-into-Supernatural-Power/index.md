Stage 1: Initiation
The Monstrous Soul's metamorphosis begins with the Initiation stage. Here, the human soul is exposed to a catalyst, be it an encounter with an otherworldly being, participation in an ancient ritual, or obtaining forbidden knowledge that unveils a hidden aspect of reality. The Initiation stage sparks a curiosity that leaves the soul vulnerable to change.

During this stage, the soul's physical form starts to subtly change, with veins becoming more visible, and the eyes taking on a darker hue. Emotionally, they experience an insatiable curiosity and attraction to the dark and arcane. Spiritually, the soul becomes untethered from traditional belief systems, marking the beginning of its transformation.

Stage 2: Temptation
The Temptation stage involves exploring the darker realms. The otherworldly beings or ancient rituals introduced in the Initiation stage play a significant role in feeding the growing darkness within the soul. The human soul is drawn to this, gaining power and knowledge but at a price.

Physically, shadows cling to the entity's form, making them appear more menacing. Emotionally, the soul struggles to retain their humanity, with the weight of the darkness and temptation becoming overwhelming. Spiritually, the supernatural presence grows stronger, and the soul starts to manifest powers related to the source of its initiation.

Stage 3: Corruption
The third stage, Corruption, is marked by the total succumbing to the darkness. The soul fully embraces its Monstrous nature, completing ancient pacts, and losing its former identity. The soul's connection to the human world fades, as it becomes a fully formed supernatural entity.

In this stage, the physical form undergoes a ghastly transformation, with extremities lengthening, skin hardening, and elongated fangs or talons emerging. Emotions become twisted and cruel, with the remaining love and compassion turning into malice and cruelty. Spiritually, the Monstrous Soul gains full control over its new abilities, marking it as an otherworldly force to be reckoned with.

Stage 4: Dominion
The final stage, Dominion, is the Monstrous Soul's revelation of its newfound power. During this stage, the entity seeks to expand its influence by recruiting followers, spreading darkness, and exercising control over the weak-willed.

Physically, the Monstrous Soul reaches the peak of its transformation, exuding an aura of darkness and fear that can be felt by those in close proximity. Emotionally, it becomes detached from any empathy, utterly devoted to its newfound cause. Spiritually, the soul has reached its zenith, commanding an arsenal of supernatural abilities to manipulate the world around it and leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in its wake.

In conclusion, the metamorphosis of a Monstrous Soul is an intricate and terrifying journey, stretching from the human realm into the supernatural. With the influence of otherworldly beings, ancient rituals, or forbidden knowledge guiding the transformation, the stages of Initiation, Temptation, Corruption, and Dominion represent a chilling descent into darkness and power.
