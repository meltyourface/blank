excerpt: Compose a captivating, lyrical poem infused with rich symbolism and vivid imagery, dedicated as an offering to the enigmatic Moon Goddess, Selene. The poem should embody the essence of lunar energies and align with the magickal atmosphere of a Full Moon ritual. Incorporate themes of illumination, rejuvenation, and heightened intuition while reciting the poem during the apex of the Full Moon, as well as weaving references to specific ritual tools, such as silver chalices, ethereal moonstones, and smoldering incense, to enhance the vividness of the cosmic experience. Conjure a sense of tantalizing awe throughout, that deeply resonates with the spiritual practitioners partaking in the Full Moon ritual, invoking a potent connection with the divine Moon Goddess herself.

In the twilight of the night, when shadows dance and play,
A symphony of silver beams doth trickle o'er the bay.
Upon the moonlit waves, ensconced in ardor and desire,
Selene, she whispers low, igniting lunar fire.

The silver chalice brimming, like her chariot divine,
A potion to anoint us, with her spark and powerful sign.
Amidst this rite, we quiver, intoxicated, entranced,
With ethereal moonstones gleaming, lunar power enhanced.

A wreath of smoldering incense circles round her sphere,
As creatures of the night, in awe, draw tentatively near.
For 'tis the peak, the apex, the crescendo of her might,
The Full Moon's magick, mesmerizing, captured in our sight.

A swathe of white luminescence, where midnight meets the sky,
Illumination wrapped in whispers, the Moon Goddess drawing nigh.
Awakening our intuition, as we cast our spells with care,
Upon the tides of night's embrace, a current born of air.

Rejuvenation, it descends, like waves upon the shore,
An elixir of eternal youth, from Selene's wise, transcendent core.
Through mist and shimmer, her tender balm, we feel our spirits rise,
Bestowing lunar blessings, weaving destinies and ties.

Oh, bewitching, charming Moon, enthrall us with your hue,
As we dance the dance of shadows, in devotion, bathed in blue.
We bare our souls to your embrace, we pledge ourselves tonight,
Enraptured by your potency, the beauty of your light.

And as the ritual comes to pass, our hearts intoxicated still,
We stand among the fading mist, submitting to her will.
Selene, our Moon Goddess, her presence lingers on,
Her whispers woven through our souls, her essence ne'er withdrawn.

In reverence, we stand united, beneath her glowing flame,
Entranced and bound to her mystique, forever changed, and never the same.
