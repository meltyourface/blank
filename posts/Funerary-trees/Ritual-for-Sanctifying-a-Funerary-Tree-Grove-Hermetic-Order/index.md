For the following task, we will create a comprehensive ritual for the sanctification of a Funerary tree grove that adheres to the principles of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The focus of this ritual will be on connecting with the divine and honoring the dead, using the elements of the Earth, Air, Fire, and Water to consecrate the space. 

Step 1: Preparation
Start by selecting a suitable location within the Funerary tree grove for the ritual. Ideally, this location should have enough space for a circle to be drawn on the ground to mark the sacred ritual area. Ensure that the chosen area is clean and free from disturbances.

Step 2: Setup
Gather the following ceremonial tools and accessories:
- Athame (ritual dagger)
- Chalice (for purified water)
- Censer (for burning incense)
- Pentacle (symbol of Earth)
- Wand (symbol of Air)

These tools represent the four elements and will be used in the consecration of the sacred space. Place these tools at the cardinal points of the circle, with the Chalice in the West, Censer in the East, Pentacle in the North, and Wand in the South.

Step 3: Opening Invocation
Once the circle has been set up, begin the ritual by invoking the elemental powers of the divine. Stand at the center of the circle and perform the Sign of the Enterer, projecting your intention into the universe, then say the following invocation:

"I call upon the Great Elemental Powers of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and the guardians of the Funerary tree grove. Be here now to witness and protect this sacred work."

Step 4: Consecration of the Elements
Begin in the East with the Censer, adding the incense and allowing it to burn, then say:

"By the powers of Air, let this grove be cleansed, and filled with the breath of divine wisdom."

Move to the South with the Wand, raising it towards the sky, then say:

"By the powers of Fire, let this grove be energized, and filled with the flame of divine spirit."

Proceed to the West with the Chalice, sprinkling water around the circle, then say:

"By the powers of Water, let this grove be purified, and filled with the essence of divine love."

Finally, approach the North with the Pentacle, touching it to the ground, then say:

"By the powers of Earth, let this grove be grounded, and filled with the strength of divine stability."

Step 5: Connecting with the Funerary Trees
With the sacred space now consecrated, place your hands upon the closest Funerary tree and recite the following prayer:

"Sacred Funerary trees, guardians of the realm between life and death, be sanctified and strengthened by the energy of the elements and the divine spirit. In this sacred grove, let the living find comfort and the deceased find peace."

Step 6: Closing Invocation
To close the ritual, repeat the opening invocation in reverse order:

"I give thanks to the Great Elemental Powers of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and the guardians of the Funerary tree grove for their presence and protection. As the circle is open, let the sanctity of the sacred space remain within these trees and blend with the energies of the divine."

Perform the Sign of the Enterer one final time to seal the sacred space, and then remove the ceremonial tools from the circle. The sanctification of the Funerary tree grove is now complete.
