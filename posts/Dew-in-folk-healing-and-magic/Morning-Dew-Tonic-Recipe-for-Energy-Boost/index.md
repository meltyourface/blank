Elixir Formula: Invigorating Dew Tonic

The Invigorating Dew Tonic is a potent elixir, meticulously crafted from the mystical properties of morning dew gathered during the waxing moon phase, and a thoughtfully selected blend of regional herbs known for their magical qualities. This elixir is designed to invigorate energy levels, bolster vitality, and promote overall well-being.

Ingredients:
1. Morning dew collected during the waxing moon phase (100ml)
2. Fresh ginseng root (Panax quinquefolius) (20g)
3. Fresh basil leaves (Ocimum basilicum) (15g)
4. Fresh rosemary sprigs (Rosmarinus officinalis) (10g)
5. Fresh lemon balm leaves (Melissa officinalis) (10g)
6. Fresh mint leaves (Mentha spicata) (5g)

Appropriate correspondences of each herb:
1. **Ginseng**: Energy, vitality, strength
2. **Basil**: Protection, good fortune, love
3. **Rosemary**: Purification, memory, youth
4. **Lemon balm**: Health, longevity, happiness
5. **Mint**: Mental clarity, communication, abundance

Auspicious timing for herb collection:
- Collect ginseng, basil, rosemary, lemon balm, and mint during the dawn hours, as these are associated with the start of the day and new beginnings.
- Collect the herbs on a Wednesday morning, as this day is ruled by Mercury – the planet of communication and intellect – which enhances the overall effectiveness of the elixir.

Preparation:

Step 1: Dew Collection
- Collect the morning dew from fresh, healthy leaves, utilizing a soft cloth or sponge. Squeeze and filter the collected dew into a dark glass jar to ensure the preservation of its mystical properties.

Step 2: Infusion
- In a glass mortar and pestle, gently grind the basil, rosemary, lemon balm, and mint leaves. Add these ground herbs to the collected dew in the glass jar.
- Seal the jar and let it sit, undisturbed, in a cool and dark place for one full day.

Step 3: Decoction
- In a small saucepan, simmer the ginseng root in 200ml of distilled water for 30 minutes.
- Strain and let it cool before adding it to the infused dew mixture.

Step 4: Final Blend
- Shake the jar containing the dew and herbal infusion, ensuring the concoction is well-blended.
- Strain the mixture through a fine sieve or muslin cloth into a clean, dark glass bottle.

For optimal results, take a tablespoon of the Invigorating Dew Tonic each morning on an empty stomach. This harmonious blend of mystical dew and magical herbs will enhance energy levels, promote vitality, and support overall well-being.
