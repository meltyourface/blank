To thoroughly answer this knowledge challenge, we need to explore the different roles of Apollo in ancient mythologies, his associations with the Eleusinian Mysteries, solar and lunar symbolism, and the Pythagorean doctrine. We will then analyze the connections between these elements and understand how they contribute to a holistic understanding of Apollo's significance in the field of occult wisdom.

1. Apollo in Ancient Mythologies

In Greek and Roman mythologies, Apollo was one of the most important deities, representing various aspects of life and the universe. He was the god of music, poetry, prophecy, medicine, and light, embodying harmony, reason, and order. As a solar deity, he brought light and warmth to the world, driving away darkness and disease. His connection with prophecy and divination, most notably in the oracle of Delphi, established him as a god of wisdom and truth.

2. Apollo and Eleusinian Mysteries

The Eleusinian Mysteries were initiation rituals held in the ancient Greek city of Eleusis in honor of Demeter and Persephone. While Apollo is not directly associated with these mysteries, he does have a connection through his sister, Artemis, who played a significant role in this rite. Moreover, Apollo's associations with light and enlightenment can also be symbolically tied to the spiritual transformation and illumination experienced by initiates during their participation in the secret rites.

3. Solar and Lunar Symbolism

In solar symbolism, Apollo, the sun god, represents a celestial maiden or the “anima mundi,” the soul of the world. The sun (Apollo) and the moon (Artemis) are siblings in mythology and are linked to the duality of light and darkness, consciousness and unconsciousness, masculinity, and femininity. As an essential symbol in various occult teachings, Apollo's solar nature hints at illumination, awakening of spiritual wisdom, and mastery of the elements.

4. Apollo and the Pythagorean Doctrine

The Pythagorean doctrine, established by the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras, was an esoteric teaching that incorporated mathematics, music, and harmonious cosmic patterns. Apollo, the god of music and harmonious order, symbolically resonates with the Pythagorean doctrine as it emphasizes universal harmony and the divine proportions that govern the cosmos.

By examining these aspects of Apollo, we can identify connections that contribute to a holistic understanding of his significance in the realm of occult wisdom.

Firstly, Apollo's status as a solar deity and his connections with light and warmth symbolize the process of illumination and enlightenment experienced by seekers of occult knowledge. This solar symbolism can be further linked to the Eleusinian Mysteries' transformative journeys into the depths of spiritual knowledge.

Secondly, Apollo's connection to music and harmony corresponds to the Pythagorean doctrine's emphasis on cosmic patterns and harmonious order in the universe. The search for hidden truths in numbers and the underlying geometries present in nature echoes the pursuit of occult knowledge and the belief in the underlying mysteries of existence governed by harmonious laws.

In summary, the different roles and associations of Apollo in ancient mythologies, the Eleusinian Mysteries, solar and lunar symbolism, and the Pythagorean doctrine reveal a deity whose multifaceted nature offers multiple paths for seekers of occult wisdom and knowledge. By viewing Apollo through these interconnected lenses, we can appreciate the god's prominence in the field of occult wisdom, a symbol of the harmony and balance that lie at the heart of the mysteries of the cosmos.
