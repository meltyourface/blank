description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Apollo, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Compose an intricate, contemporary poem invoking Apollo's guidance, delving into his mastery of prophecy, healing, and the arts. Include specific references to his Pythian Oracle at Delphi, the mythic tale of Daphne, and his role as the patron deity of musicians and poets. Utilize a blending of classical and avant-garde verse structures to reflect the intricate nature of Apollo's divine knowledge and establish the complexities of seeking his wisdom in the modern world.

Amidst the maddening dissonance of age,
Where modern muses wander lost in time,
I call upon the golden god, the sage
Whose light transcends our broken pantomime.

Apollo, seer of world's enigma vain,
Bestow thy prophetic touch on my song,
That ancient wisdom with the new shall ming
And forge a verse, illuminated throng.

From Delphi's mount – Pythia, voice of gods –
Awestruck believers sought thy gifts in awe,
While serpentine twists of fate revealed their odds,
Thy sacred temple, where mortals swore.

They gasped for truth midst fumes of ecstasy,
For in thy whispers they found revelation,
As Earth's chandelier, a tapestry,
Wove dreams and fears into constellation.

Transmuted, Daphne's tale I invoke next,
Her verdant limbs embracing Apollo's shame,
Amidst the laurels, love and lust perplexed,
Eternal chase, like shadows cast in flame.

She fled thy touch, oh shining deity,
Transformed and rooted as a tree in soil,
Her laurels now thy mark of victory,
And symbol of the endless chase, the toil.

Lastly, unravel heaven's hidden tapestry,
With lyre and bow thy unmatched skill we praise,
Patron of Muses, poets in revelry,
And keeper of the chorus from ancient days.

How shall our fractured world receive thy gift?
In pixels fair, or viral ballads spread,
Our words entwined with binary swift,
The blessings of thy touch on every head?

I sing today with reverence renewed,
Apollo, guide my trembling hand and soul,
Let modern myths and ancient echoes feud,
And birth a voice both classic and untold.

Within these lines, now cast thy golden thread,
Exalt the mortal, tear back the veil of night,
Reveal the truths we seek, the puzzles spread,
Suspend once more the sun, and share thy light.
