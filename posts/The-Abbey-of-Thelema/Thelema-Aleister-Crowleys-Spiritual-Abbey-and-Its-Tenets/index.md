## The Abbey of Thelema and the Spiritual Path of a Thelemite

### I. Introduction to The Abbey of Thelema

The Abbey of Thelema is a spiritual sanctuary and commune that played a vital role in the development of modern Thelema, a philosophy, and collection of practices based on the mantra "Do what thou wilt." Founded by Aleister Crowley, an influential 20th-century British occultist, the Abbey was established in Cefal√π, Sicily, in 1920 to serve as a center for the study and practice of Crowley's mystical beliefs.

### II. History of The Abbey of Thelema

Aleister Crowley, born Edward Alexander Crowley, was a prolific writer, poet, and ceremonial magician. Known as "The Great Beast 666," Crowley propounded a new spiritual path he termed "Thelema" after believing he received a divine revelation from a higher intelligence called Aiwass in 1904. This revelation, which encompassed the core principles of Thelema, was transcribed in the text Liber AL vel Legis, also known as The Book of the Law.

In 1920, he founded the Abbey of Thelema to provide students and practitioners of Thelema with an environment conducive to learning and practicing the tenets of his spiritual philosophy. However, the Abbey encountered numerous controversies and challenges. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini eventually expelled Crowley and his followers in 1923, leading to the Abbey's abandonment and marking the end of an essential era in Thelemic history.

### III. Core Tenets of Thelema

Though complex and at times enigmatic, Thelema's key principles can be summarized in the following tenets:

1. "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" (Liber AL I: 40).
2. "Love is the law, love under will" (Liber AL I: 57).
3. "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt" (Liber AL III: 60).
