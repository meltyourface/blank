To explore the deeper esoteric implications behind the phrase "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," as well as its relation to the purpose, practices, and possible initiatory experiences within the Abbey of Thelema, it is crucial first to understand the context in which these words originated and their historical and philosophical background.

Aleister Crowley, a British occultist and spiritual leader, founded The Abbey of Thelema in Cefal√π, Sicily, in 1920. This experiment in alternative living sought to realize the ideals found in his belief system, called Thelema. Central to Thelema is the understanding and embodiment of the Law of Thelema, whose most famous line is "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," found in Crowley's sacred text The Book of the Law, which he claimed was dictated to him by a spiritual entity named Aiwass in 1904.

To fully grasp the depth of this statement, it is essential to recognize the meaning of two key elements: "Do what thou wilt" and "the whole of the Law."

1. "Do what thou wilt": On the surface, this phrase might seem like an invitation to indulge in selfish desires and unrestrained hedonism. However, the deeper esoteric meaning is more nuanced and complex. "Do what thou wilt" refers to discovering and following one's "True Will," which is the ultimate purpose of an individual's life, as determined by their innermost nature. True Will is akin to the idea of dharma in Eastern philosophies and could be considered an inherent spiritual calling that directs an individual's actions while harmonizing with the unfolding of the cosmos itself.

2. "The whole of the Law": This phrase emphasizes that True Will is the single guiding principle for living life and because every individual's True Will is unique and different, no universally applicable moral codes can dictate how one should act. In this sense, the Law of Thelema is opposed to dogmatic and authoritarian moral systems that seek to impose constraints on individual expression.

Now that we have established the deeper meaning of "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," we can explore how it connects to the purpose, practices, and initiatory experiences at the Abbey of Thelema.

**Purpose**: The primary objective of the Abbey was to provide an environment where members could pursue their individual paths without constraints imposed by traditional religious, social, or moral expectations. By living in accordance with the Law of Thelema, the Abbey's inhabitants aimed to attain self-realization and spiritual enlightenment through the understanding and fulfillment of their personal True Wills.

**Practices**: Crowley and the Abbey's members developed and practiced a diverse range of esoteric disciplines designed to facilitate the discovery and realization of one's True Will. These practices included ceremonial magic, yoga, astral projection, invocation of deities, and other rituals adapted from a cross-cultural array of occult and mystical traditions. The intent behind these practices was self-transformation, whereby adherents sought to shatter preconceived limitations and awaken their latent spiritual capacities.

Initiatory experiences: Life at the Abbey often included a series of initiatory experiences whereby practitioners faced tests and challenges designed to stimulate personal and spiritual growth. Initiates would confront and overcome their psychological and emotional obstacles, thereby revealing their deeper nature and forging a more profound connection to their True Will. As one progressed through the stages of Thelemic initiation, they would achieve mastery over their mind and body, leading to profound self-awareness and spiritual advancement.

In summary, the phrase "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" encapsulates the crucial Thelemic tenet of individual self-realization through the discovery and fulfillment of one's True Will. Drawing from a wide array of esoteric practices to facilitate personal and spiritual transformation, the Abbey of Thelema served as a pioneering experiment in alternative living guided by the Law of Thelema. By engaging in challenging initiatory experiences, members sought to master their inner natures and realize their ultimate spiritual potential.
