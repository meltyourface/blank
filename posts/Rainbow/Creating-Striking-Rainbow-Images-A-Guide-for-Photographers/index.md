Capturing an elusive, mystical rainbow with a digital camera and creating a visually striking, supernatural image involves a combination of specific shooting techniques and post-processing. **Here is the process to achieve this goal**:

1. **Scouting the location**:
Find a suitable location where rainbows are more likely to occur. Maintain a lookout for the position of the sun and the moisture content in the atmosphere, as those are the key contributing factors to the formation of a rainbow. Consider scouting areas with a beautiful background or a powerful foreground to enhance the overall composition.

2. **Choosing the right equipment**:
To capture the perfect rainbow, use a digital camera with manual settings and a wide-angle lens to cover a broader area. A tripod is advisable to ensure stability while shooting long exposures. Additionally, you may want to use polarizing or gradient neutral density filters to intensify the colors and manage the dynamic range of the image.

3. **Camera settings for the mystical shot**:
Set your camera to manual mode and use the following settings:
- Aperture: f/8-f/16 - This helps to capture the maximum depth of field and ensures a sharp image.
- Shutter speed: 1/200 seconds or faster, to avoid motion blur.
- ISO: 100-200, to minimize noise in your final image.
- White balance: Set it to 'cloudy' or 'daylight' to enhance the natural colors of the rainbow.
- Focus: Set to manual and focus on a cloud or an object near the rainbow.

4. **Shooting the mystical rainbow**:
While shooting, try to compose your shot in such a way that the rainbow appears as a dominant part of the frame. Experiment with different angles and positions to capture the magic of the moment.

5. **Post-processing for otherworldly colors and dazzling details**:
After capturing the image, the next step is to enhance its vibrancy and bring out the supernatural aspect of the rainbow using post-processing software such as Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom:

- Adjust the exposure, contrast, and brightness levels to bring out the details in the scene.
- Play with the vibrancy, saturation, and hue of the colors within the rainbow to intensify and amplify the otherworldly nature of the image.
- Boost the shadows and mid-tones using curves adjustment or the 'levels' tool to reveal hidden details.
- Consider adding localized adjustments to specific parts of the image, such as the foreground, background, and the rainbow itself.
- For a more dramatic effect, use a layer mask to subtly blend in the colors of the rainbow with the surrounding elements, or to increase the contrast between the light and dark areas within the image.
- Optionally, use specialized filters or plug-ins for further color amplification and surreal effects.

By following this process, you will have a visually striking, supernatural image of an elusive, mystical rainbow that showcases not only your mastery of the Rainbow but also your creative vision and skill as a photographer.
