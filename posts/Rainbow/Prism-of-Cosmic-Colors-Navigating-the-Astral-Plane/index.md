In the realm of shadows and spectral light,
Where whispers meld with ancient rites,
A spectral band of vibrant hues,
Unveils the secret cosmos' clues.

From crimson dawn to emerald night,
A fleeting path of spectral sight,
To navigate the astral plane,
And pierce the veil ethereal, arcane.

Oh, daughter of the solar dance,
In whom vermilion spirits prance,
Thy rapturous birth, that alchemy,
To braid the Red and Orange, intangibly.

In blushing Orange, warmth ablaze,
A pyre of passion, secrets raised,
A phoenix flies in sunset's fire,
Rebirth converges, freedom's choir.

In molten Gold, the arcane key,
The art, the wealth, equanimity,
Upon the fulcrum of the soul,
Unlocks the sanctuary, makes us whole.

Where Green abounds, the living heart,
Shed and replenish, nature's part,
In verdant forests, moonlit rites,
A council formed of spectral lights.

In tow, the priestess, cloak of Blue,
Sheds illusions, stirs the stew,
In Neptune's chambers, cold and fleet,
The esoteric language, truth's own beat.

Oh Indigo, the mystic's throne,
Melancholic sea of the unknown,
A well of wisdom, primal depths,
Translucent shroud where shadows rest.

And violet, divinity's embrace,
A cosmos swirled in tempest's grace,
Of braided twilights, karmic ties,
A conduit to the hidden skies.

Upon the altar of the rain,
The fragile span of life we gain,
As colored light, both bent and seared,
Breathes secrets of dimensions feared.

This Prism, ark of spectral sheen,
A bridge to worlds unseen, pristine,
A paradox, the light within,
In rainbow's dust, the journey begins.
