Scrying is an ancient form of divination that involves gazing into an object, usually a reflective or smooth surface, to gain supernatural insights or knowledge. The practice of scrying has been utilized in various magical and cultural traditions, including those of ancient Greece, medieval Europe, and indigenous shamanic practices. An investigation and analysis into the methodologies and techniques of scrying in these contexts reveal both convergences and divergences in their approaches, understanding of symbols, as well as the role of the practitioner. 

1. Ancient Greece:

In ancient Greece, scrying was employed for divination and prophetic revelations. The tools commonly used for this purpose were water, oil, or shiny, smooth objects such as polished metal surfaces or gemstones. Sometimes, ancient Greeks also practiced a form of scrying called "lecanomancy" which involved using water in a shallow bowl.

Divinatory symbols in ancient Greek scrying were interpreted through reflections, ripples, or patterns in the water or oil. The practitioner, usually a priest or priestess, would perform ceremonies or rituals to invoke specific gods or spirits for guidance. The shamanic belief system of ancient Greece supported the idea that scrying enabled communication with otherworldly beings, contributing to the practice's widespread use.

2. Medieval Europe:

Scrying in medieval Europe typically revolved around the use of crystal balls, mirrors, or pools of water. These tools allowed the practitioner to gaze upon the chosen object in a meditative state and interpret the symbols and imagery that appeared. The role of the practitioner often fell upon seers, magicians, or witches who were believed to have supernatural abilities to perceive and interpret these symbols.

The belief system underpinning scrying in medieval Europe drew from Christian and folkloric ideas. The divine was thought to reveal hidden knowledge to the practitioner, often with the involvement of angels or other spiritual guides. However, scrying was sometimes associated with sinister sources, such as demonic forces or witchcraft, which led to its prohibition in certain periods of history.

3. Indigenous Shamanic Practices:

Scrying in indigenous shamanic practices varies significantly, as these traditions are rooted in diverse cultural and spiritual backgrounds. Scrying tools might include natural objects like stones or crystals, reflective surfaces like water or mirrors, or the use of psychotropic plants to induce altered states of consciousness.

The symbols interpreted by the shaman might comprise visions or messages from spirits and gods, or knowledge about the natural world. The role of the shaman is to communicate with the spiritual realm, interpret the symbols, and use this information for the benefit of the community. Shamanic belief systems emphasize the interconnectedness of all things, both physical and metaphysical, in which scrying provides a means to navigate the spiritual dimension.

Comparing these three traditions, key convergences include the use of reflective or smooth surfaces for scrying and the idea of contacting otherworldly entities to gain hidden knowledge. Divergences can be attributed to differing belief systems, cultural assumptions, and historical development.

In regards to contemporary application, modern-day forms of divination such as tarot card reading, astrology, and clairvoyance share similarities with scrying in their emphasis on interpretation and communication with a spiritual dimension. While scrying's use has receded, it remains a powerful influence on present-day occult practices and continues to hold relevance for those drawn to its mysterious and enigmatic allure.
