The three essential components to successfully perform Scrying are: a scrying medium or device, the practitioner's mental and psychic state, and the context or ritual surrounding the practice. Each component is deeply connected to the others, and their interrelation can be seen through various historic examples and cultural contexts.

1. Scrying Medium or Device
The scrying medium or device represents the physical tool that an individual uses to glance into the beyond or unveil unseen insights. Throughout history, various devices have been used for this purpose, typically encompassing reflective, polished, or translucent materials. Examples of these mediums include crystal balls, water bowls, mirrors, and even certain stones like obsidian. Selecting the appropriate medium or device is crucial for scrying, as the practitioner's connection to the material significantly influences the session's outcomes.

2. Practitioner's Mental and Psychic State
The second essential component in scrying is the mental and psychic receptivity of the practitioner. This involves preparing the mind and tuning into one's intuition to access hidden realms of knowledge. Practices such as meditation, visualization, and setting intentions aid in achieving the necessary state of consciousness. Cultivating these inner skills greatly impacts the effectiveness of scrying, as they enable the practitioner to gain insights beyond the ordinary perception.

3. Context or Ritual Surrounding the Practice
The context or ritual surrounding scrying plays a vital role in creating a conducive environment for access to alternate realms and insights. The practitioner can utilize ceremonies, offerings, or invocation of deities or spirits to facilitate a successful scrying session. Familiar ritual settings can also serve to relax the practitioner and enhance their concentration on the task at hand.

Historic Examples and Connections:

One historically significant example of scrying can be found in ancient Egypt, where the practice was connected to the divine and often conducted in temples with sacred pools. Here, the scrying medium was water, with priests gazing into pools to gain prophetic visions or insights from the gods. The cultural and psychological significance imbued scrying with a spiritual component, ensuring the practitioner was mentally prepared for the task.

In medieval Europe, crystal balls and obsidian mirrors became popular mediums used by seers and mystics. Natural elemental connection was crucial, as these materials were often chosen because of their cultural associations with earth-based magic and intuition. This period also saw the interrelation of ritual and context, with practitioners often utilizing ceremony and invocations to achieve a specific psychic state.

The Aztecs practiced scrying using obsidian mirrors, linking the medium with their powerful god, Tezcatlipoca. This cultural connection imbued the practice with a deep spiritual significance, highlighting the role of religious and psychological aspects in scrying. Their rituals, focusing on aspects of the sun, earth, and night, further solidify the elemental connection within their scrying practices.

In summary, the three essential components of scrying include selecting an appropriate medium or device, attaining the necessary mental and psychic state, and creating the proper context or ritual for the practice. The interrelation between these components has been demonstrated throughout history, as techniques have evolved alongside cultural, psychological, and elemental aspects. Understanding these connections is paramount for a scrying practitioner, as it allows them to access deep knowledge and insights more effectively.
