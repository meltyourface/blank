To initiate a golem with Dreadful mutilations using occult sigils, follow the procedure detailed below. This process involves the utilization of dark arcane symbols, preparatory rituals, and carving techniques to imbue the golem with animated malevolence. Proceed with caution, as the powers unleashed can be unstable and dangerous.

### I. Preparatory rituals

1. Select a suitable workspace, away from prying eyes. Ideally, the area should have a strong connection to the energies of the earth and a history of dark or occult events.

2. Cleanse the workspace using a mix of saltwater and ash from burned sigils, which will absorb any lingering negative energies. Alternatively, you may use a sage smudging ritual to cleanse the area.

3. Set up a ritual circle. Use black or red chalk to draw the circle. Encircle the golem's body with a radius of 3 meters. **Mark the cardinal points with corresponding elemental symbols**: a trident for Water in the West, a pentacle for Earth in the North, a wand for Air in the East, and a sword for Fire in the South. To channel your intent, place black candles at these points, accompanied by a bowl filled with the blood of a goat or a raven.

4. Prepare the golem. The golem should ideally be made from earth, clay, or a combination of earth and human remains. Construct the golem with the proportions and shape of a humanoid figure. Ensure that the flesh is malleable enough to undergo mutilation for sigil inscription.

### II. Carving techniques

1. Gather the instruments for inscription. Ideally, use a carved obsidian blade or a knife forged from meteorite iron. Alternatively, a mundane knife charged with dark energy may suffice.

2. Invoke dark energies by chanting incantations in a language attuned to the origin of the golem (e.g., Hebrew, Enochian, or Sumerian). Focus on the malevolent animation of the golem to facilitate inscription.

3. Carefully carve the sigils into the golem's flesh, starting from the crown of the head and progressing downwards to the feet. Consider engraving designs featuring fluid curves to prevent the accidental activation or collapse of energies while etching.

### III. Specific arcane symbols

1. **Golemic Binding**: Engrave a binding sigil onto the golem's forehead to establish control. This sigil will serve as the link between the summoner and the golem. Ensure the complexity and precision of the sigil, as any error might lead to rebellion or loss of control over the entity.

2. **Elemental Synthesis**: Inscribe sigils of elemental affinity on the golem's chest to link the entity with its native elemental energies. For an earth-based golem, incorporate symbols for earth, clay, or bones.

3. **Animation**: Carve sigils of animation onto the golem's arms, torso, and legs, corresponding to the desired range of motion and capabilities. The sigil should be intricate with spiraling patterns to allow energy flow throughout the structure.

4. **Malevolence**: Finally, inscribe a malevolence sigil on the back of the golem to imbue it with a dark and malicious intent. Sigils incorporating serpentine, thorn, and bone motifs are particularly effective.

### IV. Activation

1. Complete the ritual by lighting the black candles and offering a libation of blood, alcohol, or another desirable substance in the central bowl. Recite an invocation to awaken the golem and request its allegiance.

2. Observe for any signs of animation or life. The golem should respond to commands either verbally issued or through mental telepathy.

If the golem doesn't animate, carefully review your work for errors and correct any discrepancies before attempting the ritual again. Once the golem is active, use it wisely and cautiously, as losing control over such an entity can result in catastrophe.
