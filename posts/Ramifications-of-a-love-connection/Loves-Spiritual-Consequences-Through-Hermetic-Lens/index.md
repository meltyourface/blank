To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first lay a foundation and understanding of the key concepts within the context of Hermetic principles, the interconnectedness of all things, and the metaphysical concept of synchronicity.

Hermetic principles originate from the collection of texts known as the Corpus Hermeticum, attributed to the sage Hermes Trismegistus. ****In these texts, we find seven fundamental principles that encompass the Universe's workings****: Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender. These principles seek to elucidate the interconnectedness of all things in both spiritual and physical realms.

The interconnectedness of all things posits that everything within the Universe, despite its apparent separateness, is connected in some way. This interconnectedness is governed by overarching laws and patterns, with the belief that events in our lives do not occur in isolation but are inextricably linked to each other as well as to the spiritual realm.

Synchronicity is a metaphysical concept proposed by psychologist Carl Jung, who believed that events in our lives are not random occurrences but rather meaningful incidences that align with both our conscious and unconscious thoughts. Jung explains synchronicity as an underlying pattern of meaningful coincidences, connected by unseen threads that interweave and influence our lives.

Now that we have outlined the context, we can delve into analyzing the esoteric consequences of a seemingly coincidental love connection on the spiritual and mundane lives of both participants involved.

1. ****Soul's Journey****: The Hermetic principle of Correspondence states "As above, so below; as within, so without." This implies a connection between our spiritual development and our physical experiences. When two individuals share a love connection, their souls are executing what is known as a soul contract, an agreement made in the spiritual realm to fulfill certain lessons, experiences or to aid in each other's growth. Throughout their relationship, they will explore and address karmic issues, providing opportunities for growth, healing, and self-realization. Such relationships may bring profound spiritual transformation for both participants, which may consequently influence their soul's journey.

2. ****Personal Growth****: Apart from the spiritual realm, love connections impact personal growth in the material world. The principle of Vibration, which posits that everything in the Universe is in a constant state of motion, indicates that people grow or learn by moving from one state to another. A meaningful love connection can instigate profound growth through sharing experiences, learning, and emotions. Considering the interconnectedness of all things, these developments not only influence the couple's lives but also affect the collective knowledge pool within their direct and indirect surroundings.

3. ****Ripple Effect on Circles of Influence****: Love connections often create ripples in their respective circles of influence. The Hermetic principle of Cause and Effect highlights that an action taken in one area of life can lead to consequences, either positive or negative, in other aspects of life. This extends to love connections, where actions within the relationship lead to changes outside it - potentially affecting the well-being, attitudes, and growth of those around the couple. The principle of synchronicity would suggest that these consequences are not mere coincidences but rather elements of a series of interconnected events.

In conclusion, a seemingly coincidental love connection, seen through the lens of Hermetic principles, the interconnectedness of all things, and the concept of synchronicity, reveals a deep underlying meaning that transcends the mundane love story on the surface. The consequences of this connection range from impact on the soul's journey, personal growth, and extending to ripple effects in the spheres of both participants' influence. The key themes involved in such connections are spiritual and emotional transformation and the recognition that occurrences in our lives are not isolated experiences but deeply interwoven threads of a vast tapestry that connects us all.
