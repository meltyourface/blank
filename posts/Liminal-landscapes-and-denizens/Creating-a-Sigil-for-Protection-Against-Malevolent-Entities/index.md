  To create a specialized sigil for protection against malevolent entities native to Liminal landscapes, I will incorporate arcane symbology, complex engravings, and elements from ancient grimoires and lore. This sigil will be based on the principles of warding against ethereal intrusion, shielding the user from psychic attacks, and preventing malevolent beings from entering the physical realm. 
  
  To begin, I will draw upon the ancient grimoires and lore for inspiration. Many sigils utilize geometric shapes and patterns to form the basis of their protection. I will start with a circle, which represents the boundary between the physical realm and the Liminal landscapes. This circle will serve as the foundation of the sigil, providing a perimeter from which we can build our protective measures.
  
  Within the circle, I will inscribe a triangle pointing upwards. This represents the three principles upon which our protection is based: warding against ethereal intrusion, shielding from psychic attacks, and barring the entry of malevolent beings. At each point of the triangle, I will add an additional layer of symbology to enhance the power of each principle.
  
  To ward against ethereal intrusion, I will draw an intricate eye at the apex of the triangle. The eye represents the watchfulness necessary to consistently maintain the barrier and prevent malicious spirits from breaching the line between realms. Encircling the eye, I will add a series of protective runes from Norse, Celtic, and Egyptian magical traditions. These runes will serve as added defenses against spiritual intrusion.
  
  To shield the user from psychic attacks, I will inscribe a stylized flame at one of the triangle's lower points. The flame signifies the strength and resilience of the human spirit, as well as its ability to extinguish the mental assaults from malevolent entities. Surrounding the flame, a chain of Ouroboros snakes will be incorporated to demonstrate the continuous cycle of mental fortitude and renewal required to withstand psychic attacks.
  
  For the third principle, preventing malevolent beings from entering the physical realm, I will engrave another set of symbols at the remaining lower triangle point. Since several entities stem from various mythologies, I will mix symbols: a crossed sword and key to represent the combined powers of strength and wisdom, a series of interlocking pentagrams to encase malicious energies, and a coiling, elaborate vine to act as a natural and ever-growing barrier.
  
  With the core elements complete, I will embellish the sigil with other arcane symbols to enhance its potency, such as helical swirls representing the energy flow and balance, and stylized hands grasping the circle's edge to signify the determination and unity of those employing this sigil for protection.
  
  This newly designed sigil, forged from the synergy of ancient wisdom and creative innovation, will provide a potent and multi-faceted defense against malevolent entities from Liminal landscapes.
