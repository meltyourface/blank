Throughout the ages, necromancy has been practiced in various forms across diverse cultures. As such, numerous symbols, sigils, and glyphs have been used by necromancers to channel their powers and achieve their sinister goals. Here are some of the most prominent ones, categorized by their purpose.

1. Summoning spirits:

- Sigil of Ameth: Known as the Seal of Truth, this symbol was used by Dr. John Dee, a prominent Elizabethan necromancer and astrologer. The Sigil of Ameth was considered a powerful means to summon spirits and establish communication with them.

- Seal of Solomon: This hexagram is also called the Star of David and is widely used in various esoteric practices. In necromancy, it was employed for summoning and binding spirits, and to control the energies of both the spiritual and physical realms.

2. Reanimating corpses:

- Ankh: This ancient Egyptian symbol represents eternal life. Necromancers throughout history often used the Ankh to channel the life force, imbuing lifeless bodies with energy and restoring them to a semblance of life.

- Ouroboros: The serpent or dragon eating its own tail signifies the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. As a necromantic glyph, the Ouroboros represents the process of reanimation, as the necromancer controls the renewal and recycling of energy in the corpse.

3. Controlling spiritual energies:

- Pentagram: The five-pointed star is a powerful symbol for controlling spiritual energies and summoning spirits. It is commonly used by necromancers to control the energies they harness, protecting themselves from being overwhelmed by the power they have summoned.

- Eye of Horus: This ancient Egyptian symbol represents protection, healing, and the mastery of spiritual energies. Necromancers use the Eye of Horus to ward off evil spirits, control the spiritual energies they invoke, and channel them for specific purposes.

Throughout the history of necromancy, these symbols, sigils, and glyphs have been adapted and altered by practitioners to suit their specific needs and methods. The symbols mentioned above may appear in different forms depending on the era, culture, and the personal style of a necromancer.

For example, the Sigil of Ameth has various iterations based on the period and location of its use. The same applies to the other sigils and symbols I mentioned. Necromancers from the Middle Ages might have simpler and more abstract versions of a sigil compared to Victorian practitioners, who may have more intricate and ornate designs.

These variations are essential to understanding the evolution of necromancy and its cultural adaptations. By examining these symbols and their differing manifestations, we can derive insights into the development of necromancy and how its practitioners have interacted with the energies and forces they sought to manipulate.
