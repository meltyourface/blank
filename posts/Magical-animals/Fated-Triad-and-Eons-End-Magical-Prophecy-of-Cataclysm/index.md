In the Age of Ignis Est, where the flames of knowledge cast luminous shadows, a prophecy of great import was inscribed upon Hagen's Obelisk, its origin obscured by the sands of time. The words, seemingly created by an otherworldly scribe who commanded the Quill of Al'Tymnia, wove together the fateful roles of magical beings and their influence on the Eon's End – a cataclysmic occurrence to raze the world and forge it anew.

The chronicle began with the Zephyrius Tigers, fleet-footed beings that traversed the skies, carried by the winds' embrace. A serenade to Luna, goddess of the night, emboldened their hearts and granted them the might to shape the breeze. They pledged to guard the Dawn of Triluna, when three moons would rise and darkness would devour day, concealed within a riddle:

"Tripearled twilight veil enwraps as light takes flight,
The Zephyrius path beholden by Luna's sight."

The Ophidian Serpents of Zal'irra, masters of the earth's wisdom and wielders of the cosmic flames, formed an alliance with the enchanting Ellesmera, whose eyes glittered like a thousand galaxies. United, they sought dominion over the divine fire, forging both path and purpose in unison. An enigmatic verse bound their serpentine might:

"Celestial blaze entwined, scions of tempest and earthborn flare,
She who sees the cosmic dance shall secrets share."

As the sacred pacts were whispered into existence, the Glimmerwings, dragons with wings of arcane crystal and iridescent scales, held dominion over the perennial streams of magic. These wise, behemoth creatures, winged guardians of mystic enchantments, waged a war with the astral phoenixes of Auroros, carrying forth messages of hope and renewal. Fire and crystal shone as one, their conflict echoing destiny:

"Astride the cosmic rivers, Glimmer-gifted, born from crystal rain,
Fiery wings and radiant hearts converge in fate's refrain."

Thus, the Fated Triad was formed - Zephyrius Tigers, Ophidian Serpents, and Glimmerwings - weaving the web of the Eon's End. Each harbored their secrets, knowing that the time for their power to manifest would come when the cosmiconstellus aligned, proclaiming the Twilight Hour – a point in time that marked the world's tear and renewal:

"Darkened skies illumined by ancient gateways' gleam,
The Twilight Hour reveals a future, yet unseen."

Through cataclysm, these magical beings would gather fury as the oceans swallowed whole continents, and the Frenzied Wilds burgeoned under the weight of a dying epoch. At the Eon's End, they would join forces or conspire against each other, their choices indelibly shaping the course of the New Era, sealing the world's fate upon a parchment of starlight.

The prophecy decreed that the Fated Triad's actions would reforge the earth and bring about a fresh dawn. Yet, the cryptic timeline, decipherable only by those who could unravel the language of the stars, ensured the shadows of uncertainty lingered, hanging over the world like a shroud, whispering tales of things to come.
