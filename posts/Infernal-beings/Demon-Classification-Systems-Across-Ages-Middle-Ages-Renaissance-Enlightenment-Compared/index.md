Throughout the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Enlightenment periods, various demon classification systems were employed by diabolical grimoires, clandestine texts, and infernal taxonomy manuscripts. These systems aimed to organize and categorize the numerous infernal beings which were believed to exist in the spiritual realm. Although these classification systems have key differences in terms of hierarchy, function, and attributes, there are also similarities in terms of the roles and characteristics of the infernal beings. This analysis will focus on the different classification systems employed in each period and the reasons and factors that led to their evolution.

Middle Ages:
During the Middle Ages, one of the primary demonic classification systems used was the one developed by Alfonso de Spina, a Spanish Franciscan bishop, in his work "Fortalicium Fidei" (1458). In this system, de Spina categorized demons into ten orders, according to their functions and powers. These orders begin with false gods and end with witches and wizards who directly deal with these creatures. The main distinction in this hierarchy is based on the degree of rebellion against God and the degree of power with which they can tempt humans.

Renaissance:
In the Renaissance period, two major classification systems for demons emerged, namely those devised by Johann Weyer in "Pseudomonarchia Daemonum" (1577) and by Collin de Plancy in "Dictionnaire Infernal" (1818). Weyer's classification included 69 demons, with each demon's attributes and areas of expertise outlined explicitly. On the other hand, Collin de Plancy's classification listed 69 infernal beings, detailing their hierarchy, appearance, and abilities. Both systems demonstrated a deeper attempt to understand and categorize the demonic realm. One example demon from the Renaissance period is Astaroth, portrayed as a high-ranking demon and the treasurer of hell, known for his deep knowledge and cunning ways.

Enlightenment Period:
During the Enlightenment, the famous grimoire "The Lesser Key of Solomon," or "Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis" (17th century), presented an intricate classification system of demons. This system divided the infernal hierarchy into four main categories, each ruled by a different king: Goetic demons (ruled by King Paimon), Theurgic demons (ruled by King Asmodai), and two other sets of demons, each governed by the kings Beleth and Purson. Each demonic entity was assigned a function, such as teaching various arts and sciences, answering questions, or causing destruction. In this classification system, the total number of demons was 72, with each possessing a unique emblem or seal representing their essence.

Evolution and Relevance to Demon Summoning and Ritual Magic:
As societies and cultures evolved, the interest in arcane knowledge and the understanding of the demonic realm grew. This led to an increasing complexity of classification systems and an expansion of demonic roles and abilities. The grimoires, texts, and manuscript's demon classification systems were treated as essential tools to understand and control infernal beings in practical applications, such as ritual magic, summoning, and controlling demons for personal or professional goals. The inclusion of demons' seals provided practitioners with a symbolic means of invoking and managing these entities.

Shifts in the characteristics and roles of demons throughout these systems reflected the changing beliefs and perspectives on religion, science, magic, and morality during each particular period. For example, during the Renaissance, demons were attributed with more knowledge and connection to the sciences due to the growing interest in scientific discovery and human knowledge.

In conclusion, the various classification systems used by diabolical grimoires, clandestine texts, and infernal taxonomy manuscripts throughout the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Enlightenment periods reflected the evolving perceptions of the infernal realm and its inhabitants. Each classification system provided a unique perspective on the organization and attributes of infernal beings while also reflecting the cultural, religious, and moral values of its epoch.
