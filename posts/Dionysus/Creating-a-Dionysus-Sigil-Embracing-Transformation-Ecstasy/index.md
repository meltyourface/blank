  To design this sigil that encapsulates the arcane secrets and revelries of Dionysus, we will first examine each element and its significance before weaving them together into an intricate design.
  
  1. ****Divine association with wine****: This aspect can be represented by using grapevines, grape clusters, and wine glasses in the sigil. Wine was sacred to Dionysus and symbolized the ability to transcend everyday concerns and access the spirit.
  
  2. ****Divine association with ecstasy****: Dionysus was the god of ecstatic and trance states. This element can be represented through spiraling patterns and wild, organic lines that resemble the fluidity of dance, mirroring the uninhibited freedom offered by Dionysus.
  
  3. ****Divine association with transformation****: Dionysus was known as a shape-shifting god who transcended the mortal realm and unified opposites. Incorporate symbols of duality, such as the moon and sun or a yin-yang symbol, to represent the transformative power of Dionysus. In addition, include symbols of rebirth and regeneration, such as butterflies or wings.
  
  4. ****Thyrsus****: This staff, topped with a pinecone and wrapped in ivy, was an important symbol of Dionysus. Include an elegant thyrsus in the sigil, entwined with grapevines and ivy leaves.
  
  Now let's create the sigil:
  
  Begin by drawing a base circle, symbolizing the unity of opposites that Dionysus represents. Within the circle, create a spiraling pattern using grapevines, representing ecstasy and the divine associations with wine. Intersperse grape clusters and wine glasses to heighten the symbolism.
  
  Next, incorporate the duality of the sun and moon on each side of the circle â€“ one half being a crescent moon and the other half being a stylized sun. This will signify Dionysus' transformative nature and his ability to join different realms.
  
  At the center of the circle, design a thyrsus staff, with a pinecone top and ivy-wrapped length. Surround this staff with energetic, flowing lines suggesting dance and revelry, signifying the ecstasy surrounding Dionysus.
  
  Incorporate butterfly and wing motifs into the grapevine spirals to showcase the transformative and regenerative aspects of Dionysus. Ensure that the design is fluid, organic, and mysterious, evoking a sense of ancient arcane knowledge.
  
  By incorporating these various influences and elements, the final sigil will express the enigmatic character of Dionysus and embody the dual nature of the god, merging the liberating, chaotic essence with a transformative, unifying force in an intricate and aesthetically enticing design.
