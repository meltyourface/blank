The Nestorian Church, or the Church of the East, emerged in the fifth century as a result of various doctrinal controversies surrounding the nature of Christ and the Theotokos, or Mary, the Mother of God. At the heart of these debates was the question of whether Christ had a single or dual nature, which Nestorius, the Archbishop of Constantinople, argued as two distinct natures - human and divine - coexisting within the person of Jesus. This idea directly challenged the doctrine of the hypostatic union, which later became the dominant Orthodox understanding of the nature of Christ. 

The enduring impact of the Nestorian Church's heretical doctrines can be observed in various aspects of Christianity, such as theological frameworks within the modern Assyrian Church of the East, the evolution of monasticism, missionary work, and cross-cultural theological disputes. 

The Assyrian Church of the East shares some theological foundations with Nestorianism, such as the belief in the dual nature of Christ and the refusal to accept the notion of the Theotokos. Despite being labeled 'Nestorian' in the Western Church, the Assyrian Church of the East insists on its theological independence and highlights its historical roots in the Persian Empire. The Christological controversy in this context demonstrates the lasting debate over the nature of Jesus and the historical divisions that remain today.

Nestorianism had a significant impact on the development of monasticism, with a revival in the fifth and sixth centuries, particularly in the regions of Mesopotamia and Persia. The practice of asceticism was promoted by Nestorian scholars such as Theodore of Mopsuestia and Diodore of Tarsus, who contributed to the intellectual foundations of Nestorian monasticism. The monastic ethos fostered a robust intellectual and spiritual tradition, which produced significant theologians and scholars that ensured the transmission of Nestorian theology.

In terms of missionary work, Nestorianism played a crucial role in spreading Christianity throughout Asia, particularly in regions like Central Asia, China, and India. The Mongol conquests of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries further facilitated the transmission of Nestorian Christianity across Eurasia. Nestorian education and medical institutions, such as the renowned School of Nisibis, attracted students from various regions and faiths, promoting cross-cultural exchange.

Furthermore, theological disputes across the Church milieu were significantly influenced by the Nestorian controversy. The councils of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451) were convened explicitly to address the Christological disputes surrounding Nestorius and his supporters. These councils significantly shaped the Christological landscape of early Christianity, with lasting effects on the development of theological doctrines across various Christian denominations. The schism between the Western Orthodox Church and the Eastern Assyrian Church of the East reveals the complexities of inter-Church politics in the face of seemingly irreconcilable theological differences.

Primary and secondary sources that support the assessment of Nestorianism's long-lasting implications include the letters and sermons of Nestorius himself, the works of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Diodore of Tarsus, the historical annals of the Church of the East, and contemporary scholarship on Nestorianism and Christological controversies in late antiquity.

In conclusion, the enduring impact of the Nestorian Church's heretical doctrines on shaping theological frameworks within Christianity is witnessed in various aspects of religious thought and practice, particularly in the modern Assyrian Church of the East. Furthermore, the complex interplay of monasticism, missionary work, and theological disputes underscores the significance of Nestorianism in the history of Christianity. Examining the historical events, key texts, and influential figures within the Nestorian movement provides a comprehensive analysis of Nestorianism's long-lasting implications and highlights its critical role in the development of Christianity.
