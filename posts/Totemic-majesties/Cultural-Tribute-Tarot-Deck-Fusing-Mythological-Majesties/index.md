excerpt: Create an intricate and visually stunning tarot deck consisting of 78 cards, with each individual card artistically depicting a unique totemic figure associated with its corresponding major and minor arcana. Incorporate a deep understanding of totemic majesties by thoroughly researching various global cultural mythologies and their interconnected symbolism.

Ensure each card conveys the essence and distinctive characteristics of the chosen totemic figure, while also communicating the symbolic meaning and spiritual guidance it offers within the context of tarot readings. Additionally, compose a comprehensive guidebook that elucidates the nuances of each card, delves into the cultural and esoteric origins of the totemic figures, and offers guidance on interpreting the cards in various spreads and reading scenarios.

To create an intricate and visually stunning tarot deck that weaves together the symbolism of totemic majesties and the traditional major and minor arcana, I would begin with thorough research and development. Given the limitations of text-based responses, I can outline the key elements of the tarot deck as follows:

1. Research and compile a list of totemic figures from global cultural mythologies that correspond with each of the 78 traditional tarot cards. Examples could include the Thunderbird for The Tower, a legendary protective spirit in Pacific Northwest Native American mythology, or Anubis, the ancient Egyptian god associated with death and the afterlife, for the Death card.

2. Develop an overarching visual style and theme that showcases the diversity of these totemic figures while maintaining a sense of harmony and cohesion. Descending on a particular artistic style that effectively communicates the essence and significance of each figure, such as art nouveau, traditional tribal art, or a fusion of various styles.

3. Design each card, taking care to convey the unique characteristics of the selected totemic figure, weaving in the symbolic associations with its traditional tarot counterpart. Attention to detail in the composition, color palette, and visual elements would be vital to communicate the spiritual guidance and interpretations of each card.

4. For the suits of the minor arcana, maintain thematic consistency by assigning each suit to a cultural domain (e.g., Cups might correspond to Celtic mythology while Swords could link to Asian mythologies). By doing so, the minor arcana will possess distinctive regional symbolism that complements the broader global scope of the major arcana.

5. Create a comprehensive guidebook that discusses the cultural and esoteric origins of each totemic figure. Offer detailed meanings for each card's upright and reversed positions within readings. The guidebook should include instructions on performing various tarot spreads (e.g., three-card spreads, Celtic Cross, etc.) and provide advice on interpreting the cards within diverse scenarios.

Following these steps would provide a solid foundation for the creation of an artistic and meaningful tarot deck. However, since I cannot actually create the visual representations as a text-based AI, I encourage any artist, designer, or tarot enthusiast to use this proposal as a starting point in crafting their own unique totemic majesties tarot deck.
