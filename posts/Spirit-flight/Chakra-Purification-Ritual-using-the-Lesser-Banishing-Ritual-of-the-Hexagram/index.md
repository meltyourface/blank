1. Preparatory Steps
a. **Setting intentions**: Begin by clarifying the purpose of the ritual - the purification and balancing of chakras. Establish a connection to your higher self and focus on achieving a clear and balanced energetic state as you engage in this chakra purification process.

b. **Creating a sacred space**: Cleanse and consecrate the area where the ritual will be performed. Use sage, incense, or any preferred method for cleansing. Arrange any candles, crystals, and other significant objects in a circle around you, creating a dedicated space for spiritual work.

c. **Invoking spiritual entities or energies**: Call upon your spirit guides, guardian angels, or any relevant deities or spiritual entities to aid and protect you during the ritual. Request that they assist you in channeling energies and insights needed for a successful chakra clearing.

2. Performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram
a. Draw the appropriate hexagrams for each of the four cardinal directions (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water), starting from the East and moving counter-clockwise, while invoking the spiritual entities or energies associated with each element.

b. Modify the ritual symbols or gestures for chakra cleansing by visualizing each hexagram composed of radiant light, vibrating at the frequency that corresponds with the chakra being worked on.

3. Chakras and Corresponding Hexagrams
a. **Root Chakra**: Red light, Earth element; Hexagram Saturn (♄)
b. **Sacral Chakra**: Orange light, Water element; Hexagram Jupiter (♃)
c. **Solar Plexus Chakra**: Yellow light, Fire element; Hexagram Mars (♂)
d. **Heart Chakra**: Green light, Air element; Hexagram Venus (♀)
e. **Throat Chakra**: Blue light, Ether element; Hexagram Mercury (☿)
f. **Third Eye Chakra**: Indigo light, Light element; Hexagram Moon (☽)
g. **Crown Chakra**: Violet light, Cosmic Consciousness element; Hexagram Sun (☉)

4. Visualization and Energy Manipulation Techniques
a. Focus on each chakra individually, beginning with the root chakra and moving up through the body. Visualize a spinning vortex of energy in the corresponding color at each chakra point.

b. While working through each chakra, channel the energy of Spirit-flight into the specific hexagram associated with that chakra to cleanse and purify it.

c. Direct the energy by visualizing the hexagrams spinning in sync with the chakras, effectively removing blockages and facilitating the free flow of energy.

5. Addressing Obstacles and Complications
a. If distractions or negative thought patterns arise during the ritual, pause and refocus your intention on the chakra purification process.

b. Ensure that your sacred space stays cleansed and protected by consistently invoking spiritual entities and energies, as well as using any preferred tools or practices for maintaining a protected energetic space.

6. Closing the Ritual
a. After completing the chakra purification, perform grounding and centering techniques to balance and stabilize your energy.

b. Offer gratitude to any spiritual entities and energies that assisted in the ritual and respectfully bid them farewell.

c. Seal and protect the cleansed chakras by visualizing a protective shield, bubble, or cocoon of light surrounding you, maintaining the balance and harmony achieved during the ritual.

7. Complementary Practices and Tools
a. **Crystal healing**: Use chakra-specific crystals in subsequent meditations or wear as jewelry for maintaining chakra health.
b. **Essential oils**: Incorporate chakra-specific essential oils as part of your daily self-care routine, for example, by diffusing them or applying them topically (mixed with carrier oil).
c. **Meditation practices**: Engage in meditation techniques tailored to Spirit-flight, focusing on energy work and continued chakra balancing to maintain optimal chakra health.
