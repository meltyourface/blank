The deciphering of hidden codes left by ancient civilizations.

The occult almanacks were historically used to provide readers with a rich array of esoteric, astrological, and practical knowledge. However, the deciphering of hidden codes left by ancient civilizations is not a concept or practice typically associated with the occult almanacks. 

In the context of esotericism and the occult, almanacks served as repositories of astrological information, detailing the position of celestial bodies and their influence on daily life. These almanacks often contained predictions of auspicious days for magical workings, as well as the planning of agricultural activities according to celestial cycles. The belief in astrology and its influence on human affairs was widespread during the heyday of such almanacks, leading to the inclusion of such information.

A personal horoscope based on a reader's birth date and astrological sign (also known as a natal chart) was another prominent feature of occult almanacks. Astrologers would interpret the positions of the celestial bodies at the time of a person's birth and make predictions about their personality, relationships, and life events. This practice aimed to provide readers with guidance and insights into their lives and was an integral part of occult almanacks.

While it is true that the occult has expressed interest in ancient and hidden knowledge, the deciphering of hidden codes left by ancient civilizations doesn't typically fit within the scope of an almanack's content. Some esoteric and occult works might delve into such mysteries, but an almanack's primary focus would remain on astrological and practical knowledge.

In summary, the occult almanacks were primarily concerned with providing readers with astrological information and practical knowledge for everyday life, including predicting auspicious days for magical workings, planning agricultural activities according to celestial cycles, and calculating personal horoscopes. Deciphering hidden codes left by ancient civilizations, though an intriguing concept in the wider context of esotericism and the occult, is not a practice historically associated with these almanacks.
