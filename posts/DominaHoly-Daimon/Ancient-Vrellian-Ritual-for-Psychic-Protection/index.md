## I. Preparation of the Ceremony

1. Obtain the following items: a sigil parchment, a citrine crystal pendant, a silver chalice containing moon water, frankincense and myrrh incense, and a red candle.
2. Draw the Sigil of Anshar and the Sigil of Melchiela on the parchment.
3. Wear the citrine crystal pendant around your neck to enhance your spiritual connection and protection throughout the ceremony.
4. Choose an isolated location outdoors, where you can perform the ceremony under the waxing moon's light.

### II. Initiating the Ritual

1. Light the incense and the red candle, placing them on the ground forming an equidistant triangle with your sigil parchment at the top.
2. Stand in front of the sigil parchment, facing the waxing moon, and take a few deep breaths to center yourself.
3. Utter the sacred invocation in the ancient Vrellian language:

   "Ark'vor Anshar uv Melchiela, Isha'tar’vana, U’thruku vul’ari si’trela."
   (Translation: "Archon Anshar and Melchiela, guardians of light, protect my presence in this realm.")

### III. Invocation of the Guardians

1. Hold the chalice of moon water in your left hand and say the following prayer in Vrellian:

   "Nar'bana si'arovor Kal'in, mahsul arth'hagan umora."
   (Translation: "By the grace of the ethereal mother, let power and purity unite.")

2. Sprinkle some moon water on the sigil parchment, the incense, and the candle while reciting:

   "Evara' Vrellian kit'na mo'variel, Krana' ban'veri iluki."
   (Translation: "Through ancient Vrellian words of binding, I invoke the sacred guardians.")

3. Stand with your right hand above your heart and say:

   "Anshar uv Melchiela, domi'altara us'kenara, vu'llani kol'tara."
   (Translation: "Anshar and Melchiela, guide and protect me, grant me your shield.")

### IV. Empowerment of the Incantation

1. Hold the citrine crystal pendant in both hands and recite:

   "Utharnomel, citara'vin, lar'shada ki'talea."
   (Translation: "Citrine of power, lend your energy to this protective ward.")

2. Kiss the crystal pendant, then wear it back around your neck.
3. Bow your head to the waxing moon and chant:

   "Cael'var, Zel'uma, tra'si inara mel solin'e."
   (Translation: "Waxing moon, grant your blessing and strengthen this charm.")

### V. Ending the Ceremony

1. Extinguish the candle, burn the sigil parchment, and bury the ashes in the earth.
2. Thank the Archons with a final invocation:

   "Anshar uv Melchiela, uve'lana k'anoshi, vir'an. In-ka."
   (Translation: "Anshar and Melchiela, I am grateful for your guard, so it shall be.")

3. Carefully snuff out the candle and incense.
4. Leave the ceremonial area in peace, knowing that you are now safeguarded from malevolent psychic intrusions.

This DominaHoly Daimon incantation ensures comprehensive protection from negative energies and psychic disturbances when performed with faith, reverence, and knowledge of the esoteric arts. Always treat the ancient guardians and their powers with the utmost respect.
