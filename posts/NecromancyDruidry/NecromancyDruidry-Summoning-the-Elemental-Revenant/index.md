## The Ritual of the Elemental Revenant

**Purpose**:
To harmonize the elemental forces of nature with necromantic energy to create a powerful spiritual ally, the Elemental Revenant. This entity will offer guidance and protection to the practitioner. The ritual aims to establish a balanced and ethical relationship with both the natural world and the spirits from the beyond.

**Setting**:
The ritual should be performed outside, preferably at a location where different natural elements are present (e.g., a clearing within a forest, a shoreline, or a mountain).

Altar Display:
Arrange the altar at the center of the ritual space on a circular wooden platform. The platform should be adorned with symbols that represent each of the four elements (Air, Earth, Water, and Fire) and the element of Spirit. Place a large quintagram in the middle, each point representing one of the five elements.

Tools & Elemental Representations:
1. **Air**: White feather, incense (preferably sage or lavender), and a chalice with sand.
2. **Earth**: Green leaf, a small plant, and a stone or crystal.
3. **Water**: A seashell, a chalice with water, and a small waterfall or fountain.
4. **Fire**: Red candle, fireproof bowl with ash, and a lantern or torch.
5. **Spirit**: A human skull, a representative relic of a deceased relative or friend, and a small mirror.

**Layout**:
Place the elemental representations clockwise around the altar, starting with Air in the East, followed by Earth in the South, Water in the West, and Fire in the North.

Ritualistic Chants, Gestures, and Offerings:

1. **Grounding and Centering**:
Begin by standing in front of the altar, facing east. Close your eyes and take deep breaths, focusing on aligning your inner energy. After grounding and centering yourself, open your eyes and light the incense, candle, and lantern.

2. **Calling the Elemental Quarters**:
Turn to the east and say, "Spirits of Air, I call upon you to witness and guard this ritual. Awaken the ancient winds, bring clarity and wisdom."

Then turn to the south and say, "Spirits of Earth, I call upon you to witness and guard this ritual. Awaken the fertile ground, bring stability and balance."

Continue with the west and say, "Spirits of Water, I call upon you to witness and guard this ritual. Awaken the flowing river, bring healing and intuition."

Lastly, turn to the north and say, "Spirits of Fire, I call upon you to witness and guard this ritual. Awaken the dancing flame, bring courage and transformation."

3. **Invoking the Elemental Revenant**:
Hold your hands above the element of Spirit, in the center of the altar, and close your eyes. Softly chant, "From beyond the veil, I call thee, Elemental Revenant. Harness the forces of Air, Earth, Water, and Fire. Become a harmonious ally, guide, and protector, bound by ethical alignment and spiritual balance."

Repeat the chant three times, each time louder and with more determination. When you feel a presence, welcome the Elemental Revenant into your energy field.

4. **Offerings and Bonds**:
Present offerings for each element, such as flowers for Earth, a written pledge for Air, a drop of your own blood for Fire, and tears of gratitude for Water. Place the offerings at the base of the altar. This will establish a bond between you and the Elemental Revenant.

5. **Closing the Elemental Quarters**:
Beginning with the east, thank each elemental spirit for their presence and assistance, acknowledging their role in the ritual and asking them to depart in peace. Extinguish the incense, candle, and lantern, then return the elemental representations to nature or place them in a designated area of your living space to maintain the connection.

6. **Documenting the Ritual**:
Record the details of your ritual and any experience, sensations, or messages perceived during the invocation. This documentation will aid in deepening your understanding of NecromancyDruidry and enhancing your mastery of the craft.

Through the completion of this detailed NecromancyDruidry ritual, you will have forged a powerful connection with the Elemental Revenant, an entity that will offer guidance and protection through the balance and understanding of both natural and spiritual elements.
