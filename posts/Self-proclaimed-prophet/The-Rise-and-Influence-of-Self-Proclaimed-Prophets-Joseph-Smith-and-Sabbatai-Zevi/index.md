In analyzing the rise of self-proclaimed prophets throughout history, we will examine three distinct reasons: sociocultural factors, psychological factors, and esoteric elements. To do this, we will draw parallels between a well-known self-proclaimed prophet, Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism), and a lesser-known figure, Sabbatai Zevi, an influential 17th-century Jewish mystic who claimed to be the Messiah. We will evaluate the impact of their prophetic claims on spiritual development, societal structure, and the evolution of esoteric narratives.

1. **Sociocultural Factors**:
Throughout history, people have looked to prophets for guidance and solace during times of crisis, uncertainty, and upheaval. In this context, self-proclaimed prophets emerged as individuals who claimed the ability to receive divine revelations and share them with their followers. 

Joseph Smith founded the Mormon Church in the early 19th century amidst America's Second Great Awakening, a period of religious revival characterized by an explosion of new religious movements and denominations. Smith emerged as a leader during this time by presenting his alleged divine revelations as a response to the confusion and discord prevalent in society. Similarly, Sabbatai Zevi proclaimed himself the Messiah during the 1660s when Jews throughout Europe and the Ottoman Empire were experiencing persecution and disillusionment from failed messianic prophecies. Zevi's message, which heralded the eventual redemption of the Jewish people, was a direct response to the turbulent sociocultural atmosphere of the time.

2. **Psychological Factors**:
Prophetic claims are often rooted in the personal experiences and psychological profiles of the self-proclaimed prophets. Narcissism, egotism, and delusions of grandeur have often characterized these figures, as they ultimately seek recognition and attention from others, often interpreting these as validation of their prophetic status.

Joseph Smith and Sabbatai Zevi both demonstrated powerful egos and intense conviction in their divine purpose, a driving force behind their respective movements. Smith’s confidence and charisma enabled him to inspire followers and emphasize his role as the “chosen one”. Similarly, Zevi showed an extraordinary ability to attract believers due to his magnetic personality and claims of divine revelation, convincing thousands of Jews across Europe and the Middle East that he was the long-awaited Messiah.

3. **Esoteric Elements**:
The rise of self-proclaimed prophets has been partially facilitated by their association with esoteric knowledge, as exclusive access to hidden spiritual insights tends to lend an air of legitimacy. As such, prophets often introduce novel and profound ideas, incorporating esoteric concepts to distinguish themselves from mainstream religious doctrines.

Joseph Smith’s claim to have translated the Book of Mormon from ancient golden plates amended the biblical narrative, drawing from esoteric elements and introducing new doctrines, rituals, and ideas such as the existence of a pre-Columbian Christian society in the Americas. Sabbatai Zevi's movement similarly focused on Kabbalistic concepts and mystical interpretation of traditional Jewish texts, allowing for radical reinterpretations and incorporating ecstatic religious practices that distinguished his movement from conventional Judaism.

In terms of spiritual development, both prophets introduced innovative religious practices and doctrines, affecting the faith of their followers for generations to come. Smith's prophetic claims laid the foundation for the Mormon faith, with millions of adherents worldwide, deeply affecting their individual and collective spiritual identities. Conversely, Zevi's eventual conversion to Islam without the expected redemption of the Jewish people led to widespread disillusionment among his followers, thereby significantly impacting their faith and reshaping the trajectory of Jewish mysticism for future generations.

Regarding societal structure, both movements influenced social dynamics around the time they emerged. Mormonism established a defined and close-knit religious community, fostering a strong sense of unity and identity among its followers. The Sabbatean movement, in contrast, caused rifts and divisions within Jewish communities, as some denounced Zevi as a heretic, while others continued to believe in his messianic claims after his conversion to Islam.

Finally, the esoteric narratives presented by both prophets have left lasting legacies in the religious and spiritual spheres. Joseph Smith's prophetic claims contributed to the expansion of Mormon theology and perspectives, allowing the religion to evolve in unique ways over time. Ironically, Sabbatai Zevi's failed messianic prophecy led to the development of more critical and skeptical approaches in Jewish scholarship, leading to an increased reliance on textual interpretation as a source of spiritual authority.

To summarize, self-proclaimed prophets have historically risen in response to sociocultural factors, psychological factors, and esoteric elements. By examining Joseph Smith and Sabbatai Zevi as representative cases, we can discern how prophetic claims have impacted spiritual development, societal structure, and the evolution of esoteric narratives. Both prophets wielded a powerful influence, whether through the establishment of a new faith or the restructuring of an existing one, and their legacies continue to shape religious discourse and spiritual practice even today.
