Challenge Answer: Relating the symbolism and history found within bracteates to the esoteric interpretation of the threefold cosmological principle from Norse mythology, exploring potential connections to rune-inscribed amulets, divine figures, and the evolution of magical understandings within cultural contexts during the Migration Period.

To begin with, let us first focus on understanding the key terms pertinent to this challenge:

1. Bracteates: Thin, single-sided gold medallions, primarily found in Northern Europe dating back to the Migration Period (circa 400-800 AD). These amulets typically depict intricate designs and symbols, often inscribed with runic scripts, and serve as links to the migration era's magical, religious, and artistic beliefs. 

2. Esoteric interpretation: This refers to the often hidden, deeper, or symbolic meanings in a religious or spiritual context, offering insights into ancient cultures and their belief systems. 

3. Threefold cosmological principle from Norse mythology: Refers to the three essential aspects of the Norse universe – the realms of gods, humans, and giants, often represented by the cosmic tree Yggdrasil connecting the Nine Worlds of Norse cosmology. 

With this context in mind, let us delve into the relationship between the symbolism in bracteates, esoteric interpretation, and Norse mythology.

Bracteates often depict divine figures and symbols from Norse mythology, giving us a rich source of esoteric interpretations to draw insights. One prevalent figure found in bracteates is the Norse god, Odin. Odin is considered the chief god responsible for the creation of the cosmos, as well as the god of wisdom, poetry, and war. As a seeker of knowledge, he sacrificed his eye to drink from the well of Mímir, the source of all wisdom.

Drawing connections to the threefold cosmological principle, Odin's role as a shaper of the cosmos and connector of realms is evident in bracteate iconography. In many cases, bracteates portray Odin riding his eight-legged horse, Sleipnir, who could traverse through and between the Nine Worlds. This image can be seen to symbolize the interconnectedness of the Norse cosmology and Yggdrasil – as Sleipnir transports Odin between the realms, much like the cosmic tree Yggdrasil connects the worlds.

Apart from divine figures, bracteates also feature intricate runic inscriptions, which hold esoteric significance. Runes, the alphabet used by ancient Germanic peoples, including the Vikings, had both practical and magical purposes. Apart from being a script, runes were thought to hold divine power. Their origins are closely linked to Odin, who discovered them after hanging himself from Yggdrasil for nine days and nights.

Many runic inscriptions on bracteates contain magical formulas or incantations, reinforcing the connection between symbols, divine power, and the Norse cosmology. Furthermore, as amulets, bracteates were believed to provide protection and magical effects against various adversities faced by individuals during the Migration Period. In this way, bracteates symbolize the interconnectedness of the cosmological realms, as their magical properties were believed to draw power from the divine realms.

In conclusion, bracteates offer us a unique insight into the esoteric understanding of the threefold cosmological principle from Norse mythology. The symbolism and figures depicted on these amulets connect us to the magical and religious beliefs and practices of the Migration Period. They demonstrate how ancient societies relied on divine power and perceived connections between the realms of gods, humans, and giants to navigate the challenges of their time. As artifacts, bracteates embody the interwoven nature of Norse cosmology, through their depictions of divine figures like Odin and the runic inscriptions inscribed on them, accentuating the interconnectedness of all aspects within the Norse universe.
