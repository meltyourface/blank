These beings are not gods, but rather powerful spirits that have evolved alongside human civilization, serving as bridges between the physical and mystical realms. Beast Masters represent the masculine aspect of this duality, exerting authority and dominion over the various creatures of the wild, while Beast Mothers embody the nurturing, guiding, and protective forces of nature.
