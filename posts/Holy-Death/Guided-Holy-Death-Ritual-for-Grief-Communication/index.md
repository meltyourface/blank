To perform the evocative Holy Death ritual to channel a profound message from the spirit of a departed individual for a grieving loved one, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the ritual space:

- Thoroughly cleanse the room, ensuring it is free from any negative energies hindering the connection with the spirit.
- Use sacred symbols such as a pentagram or a sigil representing the Holy Death to mark the boundaries of the ritual space. You may draw this on the floor with white chalk.
- Place black and white candles in a circle around the room to enhance and balance the energy.
- Arrange marigold flowers around the space as it is believed they attract spirits of the deceased.
- Set up a small altar with favorite objects belonging to the departed individual and offerings like freshly baked bread, fruits, and drinks they cherished during their life. 

2. Perform the ritual:

- Safeguard the ritual space by calling upon protective energies using an appropriate ancient invocation such as Latin or Sanskrit. This incantation should be aimed at inviting the Holy Death to oversee the process and ensure safety during the communion.

Invocation example in Latin: "Aperi portas, Sancta Mors, et fac nobis transire ad vos. Ego te invoco venerabile spiritu, ut apud te spectans nos deducere potentiam intacta ex domo ignoto."
(Translation: "Open the doors, Holy Death, and let us pass to you. I summon you, venerable spirit, to looking upon us, lead us untouched by power from the unknown.")

- Incense, such as copal or sandalwood, should be lit to further define the atmosphere and to aid in deepening your trance.

- Quietly enter the mediumistic trance state by breathing deeply and focusing your mind on the intention to connect with the spirit of the departed individual. Envision the loved one's energy and appearance as you delve deeper into the trance.

3. Establish the connection:

- Call upon the spirit of the deceased using the ancient language chosen for the invocation. Be specific about who you want to reach and the purpose of the ritual, which is to bring solace and closure to the grieving loved one.

- Allow the spirit to communicate through your body, transmitting their thoughts and feelings as you maintain the trance state.

4. Deliver the message:

- Share the powerful message filled with intricate details of their shared past, enabling the spirit to express their wisdom comprehensively by accentuating essential points. Affirm underlying emotions and recollections that would resonate with the loved one.

- Listen attentively to any advice or guidance the spirit would like to share, which may facilitate the healing process for the grieving individual.

5. Close the ritual:

- Once the message has been conveyed and any other communications are complete, thank the spirit for their presence and generosity.

- Gradually bring yourself out of the mediumistic trance, returning to a state of conscious awareness.

- Extinguish the candles and clear away the offerings, signaling the ritual's end.

- Encourage the grieving loved one to reflect on the message received and provide them with support as they navigate the healing process.
