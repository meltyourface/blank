The Shemhamphorasch, also known as the Seventy-Two-Fold Name of God or the 216-Letter Name of God, is an occult concept derived from the Hebrew Bible and the book of Exodus. It consists of 72 triconsonantal names, each comprising three letters to make up the 216 letters in total. The Shemhamphorasch is part of the Western esoteric tradition, which plays a significant role in the evocation and workings of the Demons of the Goetia.

Historically, the Shemhamphorasch has been linked with the evocation of the Goetia Demons due to its perceived power in controlling and commanding spirits. The Goetia, also known as the Lesser Key of Solomon, is a 17th-century grimoire that primarily focuses on the evocation of 72 demons. The concept of the Shemhamphorasch can be found in various grimoires and Kabbalistic texts preceding the Goetia, but its influence in this specific context is worth exploration.

The ritual framework involving the Shemhamphorasch in Goetic evocations typically combines the use of sigils, drawn from the Goetic text, with invocation and pronunciation of the 72-names. Some practitioners believe that by properly pronouncing one or more of these divine names, they can evoke and compel the demons to appear and serve their summoner.

In terms of the historical significance of the Shemhamphorasch within the context of the Goetia, its utilization can be traced back to various magical practices during the Renaissance period, with notable figures such as Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, who was instrumental in incorporating Kabbalistic knowledge into Western occultism. The Shemhamphorasch as a concept also contains notable influence from the Sefer HaRazim and the Merkabah mysticism in Jewish esoteric literature.

Contemporary practitioners of the Goetic arts have adapted and varied the use of the Shemhamphorasch. While some still adhere to traditional methods of pronunciation and invocation, others might focus on the use of meditation, visualization, and altered states of consciousness to access the power of these divine names. Moreover, there is a growing trend of practitioners who blend the Shemhamphorasch with various Eastern and Native American spiritual practices or who use the Shemhamphorasch as part of a broader spiritual or psychological framework.

While the use and significance of the Shemhamphorasch in relation to the Goetic Demons may vary among practitioners, its intrinsic link to the evocation and workings of these spirits is undeniable. The historical and ritual frameworks demonstrated the power of the Shemhamphorasch as a tool to command and control the Demons of the Goetia, while contemporary practitioners continue to explore new methods and variations in its application, ensuring the ongoing relevance and evolution of this ancient, esoteric practice.
