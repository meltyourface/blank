In order to arrive at a holistic comprehension of the significance and interdependence of the eternal soul, transient ego, and the process of death within the context of mortality and cyclical rebirth, we must delve into the esoteric understanding that transcends cultural boundaries. By examining both Eastern and Western occult philosophies, we can begin to comprehend the inherent connectedness of these seemingly disparate concepts.

Firstly, let's define the key terms that are central to this inquiry: 

1. Eternal soul: The eternal soul, or the "innermost self," is the core of an individual's spiritual essence. It transcends time and space and is believed to be fundamentally unchanging and immortal.

2. Transient ego: The transient ego represents the temporal, conscious manifestation of the individual identity. It is closely associated with our subjective sense of self, personal desires, and emotional reactions. The transient ego is considered to be an ever-changing aspect of our being that exists and evolves within the physical realm.

3. Process of death: This refers to the physical, emotional, and spiritual changes that occur as an individual transitions from life to death, and from one state of existence to another.

In Eastern esoteric understanding, specifically within the context of Hinduism and Buddhism, the cyclical process of death and rebirth is known as Samsara. Here, the eternal soul, called the Atman in Hinduism and Anatta in Buddhism, is an invariant, self-existent entity. In Hinduism, the Atman yearns for spiritual liberation (Moksha), aiming to break free from the cycle of birth and death and eventually merge with the ultimate reality - Brahman. In Buddhism, the Anatta denies the existence of a permanent self and seeks enlightenment to escape Samsara, embracing the concept of Nirvana.

According to these Eastern philosophies, the transient ego is closely tied to the process of death and rebirth. In each incarnation, the eternal soul takes on a new transient ego through the principle of Karma - the sum of an individual's actions in their past lives which determines the nature and quality of their current and future existences. Through meditation and spiritual practice, an individual can conquer the delusory nature of their transient ego, reduce the accumulation of negative karma, and potentially achieve liberation from the cycle of Samsara.

In Western occult philosophies, the eternal soul and transient ego are often discussed under the umbrella of the Hermetic principles and Neoplatonic thought. The eternal soul, known as the "Divine Spark" or "Higher Self," is the spiritual essence that remains connected to the Divine Source. It is the part of our being that guides us on the path of spiritual growth and enlightenment. The transient ego, or the "Lower Self," is our earthly identity and is seen as an obstacle that prevents us from accessing higher truths.

The process of death and rebirth in Western esoteric thought closely resembles the initiation process undergone by the individual on their path to enlightenment. By transcending the limits of the transient ego and attaining communion with their eternal soul, the individual effectively undergoes a symbolic "death" and "rebirth." This transformation allows the individual to reach a new level of spiritual understanding and personal growth, akin to the idea of spiritual ascension.

In summary, the eternal soul, transient ego, and the process of death are deeply interconnected concepts within the context of mortality and cyclical rebirth in esoteric understanding. Eastern and Western occult traditions propose that by examining and transcending the transient ego, we can gain a deeper understanding of our eternal soul and ultimately achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death, or spiritual ascension. Through the convergence of these philosophies, we can find commonalities and shared wisdom that ultimately shape our holistic comprehension of the human experience in its entirety.
