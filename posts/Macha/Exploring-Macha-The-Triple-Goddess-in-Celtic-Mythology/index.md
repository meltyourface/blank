In order to thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first identify the key topics that are being addressed: the symbolism within the myths and legends surrounding Macha, her associations with the land, sovereignty, and fertility, her three-fold aspect, and the role these symbols play within the broader context of Celtic spirituality and esotericism. With that in mind, we'll carefully delve into each aspect, ensuring to provide a comprehensive understanding.

Macha is a prominent figure in Celtic mythology, particularly in Irish legends. Essentially a goddess with complex associations, she embodies a potent synthesis of land, sovereignty, and fertility. Derived from ancient Ireland, the myths and legends surrounding Macha are reflective of three distinct archetypes that are often thought to represent her three-fold aspect: "Macha the Wife," "Macha the Mother," and "Macha the Warrior."

1. **Symbolism in Myths and Legends Surrounding Macha**
Macha's mythology revolves predominantly around themes of sovereignty, fertility, and the land. In several stories, she is portrayed as a powerful, assertive, yet wise figure who protects her people and safeguards the kingdom's sovereignty. In many legends, she is intrinsically linked with horses - a symbol of strength, fertility, and land power in Celtic mythology. Often associated with the crow, she is a symbol of the dual nature of life and death and the cycles in-between.

Notably, one of Macha's most famous legends, known as the "Debility of the Ulstermen," showcases her supernatural abilities and highlights the complex relationship between land, power, and sovereignty. When forced to race against the fastest horses while heavily pregnant, she lays a curse on the men of Ulster, causing them to experience the pains of childbirth during times of adversity. This story emphasizes her role as a punisher of those who disrespect the land and sovereignty.

2. Association with the Land, Sovereignty, and Fertility
Macha is a personification of the land, a provider of fertility and abundance. Through this association, she is responsible for the well-being of her people. As the embodiment of sovereignty, Macha grants kings the divine right to rule, reinforcing the connection between political power and the land itself.

Moreover, her role as a fertility goddess extends to childbirth and motherhood. Many legends narrate her assistance in bringing life to the world, both on a human and ecological level, emphasizing her nurturing qualities.

3. The Three-Fold Aspect
Macha's identity and portrayals reverberate with the triple-aspect found within the Celtic spiritual and mythological realms. Macha the Wife represents the loving spouse who bonds with her husband; Macha the Mother embodies fertility and compassion; and Macha the Warrior underlines her fierce protective nature defending her domain.

These three aspects symbolize the wholeness of the feminine experience in the Celtic worldview, and the interconnectivity of birth, life, death, and rebirth.

4. **Role in Celtic Spirituality and Esotericism**
Macha's multifaceted nature is essential in understanding the broader context of Celtic spirituality and esotericism. As an embodiment of land, fertility, and sovereignty, she acts as a guiding force towards individual growth and collective consciousness. Macha's warrior aspect serves as a reminder of the need for courage and taking action to protect and nurture oneself and others. Simultaneously, the mother and wife aspects encourage compassion and caring for oneself and others as a part of spiritual development.

In conclusion, Macha's rich and layered mythology offers a multitude of symbols and teachings that serve as a vital component of Celtic spirituality and esotericism. Her symbolism within myths and legends points to the intrinsic link between land, sovereignty, and fertility, and her three-fold aspect illustrates the interconnected nature of the feminine experience within Celtic culture. By analyzing Macha's role within these stories, we can derive inspiration and guidance for personal growth and spiritual development while recognizing the importance of preserving and respecting the interconnectedness of life and the natural world.
