Hail to thee, O mighty Skaði,
Goddess of the frozen realms,
Daughter of the frosted thrones, and the icebound heart.

In the dead of winter's grasp, thy footfalls tread the earth,
Upon the snow-capped mountains do thy arrows fly and seek their prey,
In the silent woods, thy presence looms,
As the wind whispers 'midst the barren trees.

Rise, O daughter of Þjazi the fierce Jötunn,
And feel the call of our devotion!
As the vengeful widow of Njörðr,
Your gaze pierces through the frost, in pursuit of the eternal hunt,
No oath shall be broken, no bond severed but by thee!

Mother of cold, counselor of justice,
In thy halls, Skadi's öndurdís,
With guile and grace, the deathly wights shall fall,
And by thy steady hand, the giants of chaos shall be rent asunder.

With skee and bow, thou dost reclaim thy honor,
And avenge the fall of thine ice-clad kin,
With the wrath of winter's fury, vengeance is thy mantle,
Till blood becomes but ice upon the crystal shores.

In thine strength, we find courage,
In thine anger, our enemies tremble,
In thine domain, we find solace in thy cold embrace,
Unfaltering and ruthless, thou dost search for truth and retribution.

We invoke thee, O Skadi, she who bestows winter's kiss,
Keep vigil over our hearts, heavy with vengeance,
And from the shadows, may we wield thy frost-borne might,
To drive forth the endless night.

Hail to thee, Fjallingdis, Lady of the hunt,
Accept our offerings, O sublime ruler of the icy chart,
We beseech thee, guide us towards victory and truth,
Through the hallowed halls of deep winter and ice,
In the name of Skaði, we honor thy legacy.
