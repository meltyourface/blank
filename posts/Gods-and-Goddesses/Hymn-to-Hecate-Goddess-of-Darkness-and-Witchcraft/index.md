In twilight's veil, the bard shall sing,
Of Hecate, the arcane dark goddess, bring
The wisdom of the ages, night incantress be,
To hearken to the secrets that run so free.

To gods and mortals, her domain is known,
Holding fast the realms of air, earth, and sea,
And over witchcraft's symbols does she dance,
Champion of the mist, Hecateâ€™s glance.

From ancient Titans sprung her line,
Asteria twined with Perses entwined divine,
Crowned in lunar brightness, her powers reflect
From starry skies to Asphodel meadows we trek.

In crossroads at night, shall ye worship her,
When statues three-fold bear witness to tales of yore,
Oh, Saffron-robed, the Chthonic one, bring life anew,
Death and rebirth, in moons that wax and wane, are true.

The sea nymphs bore witness, fair Circe and Medea,
As Hecate's teachings rewrote reality and mania,
And o'er these paths the sorceresses once traveled,
In the wake of heroes, their fears unraveled.

When Persephone yearned for Hades' embrace,
To walk the fields of Elysium and find solace,
'Twas Hecate who granted Demeter's plea,
To divideth seven and five, winters and summer be.

For she dares to tread in realms both foul and fair,
And in Hell does Cerberus bow before her glare,
For even the depths of Tartarus hold her dear,
A place of torment and woe, 'tis clear.

Thrice-great Hermes sought her grace,
To weave the magics of the gods' embrace,
But the hounds of Hecate snarl and snap,
Their master only too well aware of Fate's dread trap.

Aegis-bearing Zeus, his thunderbolt at bay,
Smote the chaos of serpents that monsters lay,
And with Hecate's blessing did he reign on high,
His rule from the heavens, her guidance, nigh.

Enshrined within her mysteries arcane,
Those who walk with her, desire divine gain,
But tread not lightly on Hecate's path,
For wisdom comes with loss, as whispers her wrath.

Sing now of Hecate, thou with silvered tongue,
A goddess of the shadows, from the amaranth sprung,
For 'pon this eve, when dusk doth sleep,
The secrets of the night she shall now keep.
