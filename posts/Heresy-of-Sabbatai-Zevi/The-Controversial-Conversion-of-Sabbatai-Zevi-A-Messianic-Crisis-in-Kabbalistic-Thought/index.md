The circumstances surrounding Sabbatai Zevi's controversial conversion to Islam and its impact on the credibility of his messianic claims within the context of Kabbalistic, Sabbatean, and Abrahamic theological/doctrinal thought can be unraveled by exploring his life and influence, examining key events leading to his conversion, and analyzing both the theological justifications and the repercussions of his actions in the aforementioned religious frameworks.

Sabbatai Zevi's Life and Influence:
Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676) was a prominent Jewish rabbi and mystic who proclaimed himself as the Jewish messiah, the descendant from the line of King David. He attracted a considerable following during the 17th century, known as the Sabbateans, mainly due to the charisma of his personality, his extensive knowledge of Jewish mysticism, and the sociopolitical conditions of his time. The Jewish people, particularly those who had been expelled from Spain, were eager to find a source of hope and spiritual restoration.

Conversion to Islam:
Sabbatai Zevi's messianic claims, though initially well-received by many, began to wane after his ill-fated encounter with the Ottoman rulers of his time. In 1666, having traveled from Ottoman Palestine to Istanbul and amassing a large following, Zevi was arrested on the orders of Sultan Mehmed IV and presented with a choice between conversion to Islam or execution.

Under pressure and keen to preserve his life for the sake of his movement, Sabbatai Zevi decided to convert to Islam, adopting the name Aziz Mehmed Effendi. His conversion took the form of donning a turban and publicly declaring his belief in Islam. This event became a crucial turning point for the Sabbatean movement and dealt a severe blow to the credibility of Zevi's messianic claims, as the followers were now faced with a spiritual crisis.

Theological Justifications:
A minority of Zevi's followers chose to rationalize his conversion in theological terms. The most prominent of these justifications can be found in the Kabbalistic concepts of "tiqqun" (restoration) and "shevirat ha-kelim" (breaking of the vessels). According to these beliefs, the world was shattered at the time of creation and had to be restored ("tiqqun") through a process of gathering the divine sparks scattered throughout. In order to do this task, the messiah would need to descend into the impure realms (known as "kelipot"), symbolically represented by Islam and Christianity, and redeem the divine sparks concealed there.

The Sabbateans argued that Sabbatai Zevi's conversion was a deliberate act of "tiqqun" and a fulfillment of his messianic task to bring the divine light back into the world. This perspective resonated with some of his followers and led to the rise of several crypto-Jewish communities, known as Doenmeh, who outwardly practiced Islam but secretly adhered to Sabbatean teachings and rituals. 

Repercussions and Rejection:
The conversion of Sabbatai Zevi was enormously problematic for the mainstream of both Jewish and Abrahamic religious thought. His conversion not only discredited his messianic claims, but it also weakened his theological arguments regarding the concepts of tiqqun and shevirat ha-kelim. Most Jews saw Zevi's conversion as a betrayal of their faith and a repudiation of his own teachings. This created a wave of despair and disillusionment, which led to the fragmentation and eventual decline of the Sabbatean movement.

In conclusion, Sabbatai Zevi's conversion to Islam severely undermined the credibility of his messianic claims in a broader context, as his actions went against the core principles of Judaism and contradicted the expectations of a messiah as set forth in Kabbalistic and Abrahamic theological thought. Although some of his followers justified his conversion through the concept of tiqqun, the majority of Jewish people rejected his claims and perceived his actions as a betrayal of their faith.
