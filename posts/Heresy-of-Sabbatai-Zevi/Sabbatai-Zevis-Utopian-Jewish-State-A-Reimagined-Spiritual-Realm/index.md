In this hypothetical scenario, Sabbatai Zevi, the 17th-century Jewish mystic and self-proclaimed messiah at the center of the Heresy of Sabbatai Zevi, triumphantly creates a Jewish state rooted in his unique beliefs and teachings. Let's imagine this state nestled in the eastern Mediterranean region, strategically positioned to maintain close connections with both Europe and Asia, and with a flourishing economy based on trade and commerce.

The political landscape within this Jewish state is characterized by a harmonious blend of mystical spirituality and pragmatic governance. The highest authority in the land is the Council of Emanations, a ruling body comprised of twelve elite members, each representing a different aspect of the divine Sefirot. This council is guided by the spiritual teachings of the Heresy of Sabbatai Zevi and headed by the figure of Sabbatai Zevi himself, who is considered as the embodiment of the messianic Tikkun, responsible for restoring balance within the divine realm and the earthly sphere.

Power dynamics within the state are marked by tension and careful negotiation. The Council of Emanations maintains a delicate balance, grappling with various factions and ideological groups that vie for influence. Among these factions are the Doenmeh, a secretive organization of crypto-Jewish followers of Sabbatai Zevi who pledge allegiance to him but remain outwardly Muslim; and the Sabbatean Lurianists, adherents of Sabbatai Zevi that ascribe to the teachings of Isaac Luria, the legendary founder of modern Kabbalah.

Alliances beyond the borders of this Jewish state are diverse and forged strategically. Sabbatai Zevi's charismatic diplomacy wins allegiances among both Christian and Muslim-majority neighbors, causing religious tolerance to become the order of the day. This allows for the steady growth and expansion of the Sabbatean state, gradually incorporating surrounding territories.

Spiritually, the state is steeped in the esoteric teachings of Sabbatai Zevi, which are rooted in Lurianic Kabbalah and his interpretation of traditional Jewish teachings. The primary doctrine of this Jewish state is the belief that Sabbatai Zevi's messianic mission is to redeem humanity by reuniting the fractured divine realms through Tikkun.

The religious institutions of this state prioritize spiritual study, meditation, and renewal of the soul. The state maintains numerous mystical academies, where scholars are encouraged to delve into the mysteries of Kabbalah and unlock the hidden truths of the divine. Though some of these spiritual practices occasionally deviate from mainstream Jewish observance, the overall focus is on fostering a deep connection with the divine.

The impact and influence of Sabbatai Zevi's heretical ideology extend far beyond the borders of this Jewish state, reshaping religious landscapes throughout the region. The principles of religious tolerance and the embrace of mysticism appeal to a wide range of believers across different faiths, leading to a flourishing exchange of ideas and spiritual practices.

Perhaps the most profound change this Sabbatean Jewish state brings about is a radical reimagining of the role of suffering and divine retribution in religious life. Sabbatai Zevi's unique doctrine of Tikkun promotes the idea that the spiritual work of restoring balance in the world is ongoing and requires active engagement from every individual. This emphasis on collective and individual responsibility fosters a compassionate approach to governance and encourages citizens to transcend ideological divisions in the pursuit of spiritual growth.

In conclusion, the Jewish state founded by Sabbatai Zevi represents a utopian vision of a society guided by the mystical aspirations rooted in the Heresy of Sabbatai Zevi. Such a state challenges conventional religious thinking and paves the way for spiritual evolution, tolerance, and compassionate governance. While this scenario remains hypothetical, it offers a tantalizing glimpse into an alternative world shaped by the enigmatic figure and his disputed teachings.
