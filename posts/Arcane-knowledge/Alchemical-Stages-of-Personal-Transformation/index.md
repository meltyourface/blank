  Incorporate an in-depth analysis of the four primary stages of the Magnum Opus in alchemical transformation, including their corresponding symbols and allegorical representations. Emphasize the significance of each stage in relation to the arduous process of transmuting base metals into gold, while also unveiling any hidden spiritual interpretations or esoteric connections within these transformations. Moreover, evaluate the relationship between the stages and the three alchemical principles of Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt as they manifest throughout the progression of the Great Work. Lastly, examine any variations or alternative interpretations of these stages throughout historical and contemporary alchemical texts, both Western and Eastern, to address potential discrepancies and enrich the complexity of the task.

The Magnum Opus, also known as the Great Work, is the arduous process of alchemical transformation that aims to transmute base metals into gold. These stages are deeply symbolic and hold esoteric meanings, reflecting both physical and spiritual metamorphosis. The four primary stages of the Magnum Opus are Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, and Rubedo. Each stage corresponds to a particular color and chemical transformation.

1. **Nigredo**
Nigredo, or the blackening, is the first stage of the Magnum Opus. It represents the initial stage of putrefaction and decomposition of the base metals. During this phase, the base matter is broken down both physically and symbolically through the process of calcination. In alchemical symbolism, Nigredo is represented by a raven or a crow and is often associated with melancholia and the inevitable decay of all matter.

Spiritually, Nigredo represents the breakdown of the individual's ego and the beginning of introspection. This introspective process encourages the alchemist to face their inner darkness and confront their deepest fears. The alchemical Sulphur, representing the soul, is dominant in this stage, signifying its link to the individual's inner transformation.

2. **Albedo**
The second stage, Albedo, or the whitening, is marked by the purification and cleansing of the base matter. This is achieved through processes such as sublimation, distillation, and filtration, which separates the impurities from the substance. As a symbol, Albedo is represented by the swan or the white rose and signifies the rebirth of matter into a purer form.

Within the spiritual context, Albedo illustrates the emergence of a new state of consciousness that comes after facing one's darkness during the Nigredo phase. Albedo is characterized by a newfound purity, and the principle of Mercury, standing for the spirit, presides over this stage.

3. **Citrinitas**
Citrinitas, or the yellowing, is the third stage of the Magnum Opus and is associated with the transition from the purified state to a more enlightened phase. In this stage, the emerging wisdom is symbolized by the image of the phoenix or the pelican and is often connected to the solar and lunar duality. The alchemical principle of Salt, representing the physical body, comes into play during this stage. The balance between the body, soul, and spirit is achieved in this phase.

Citrinitas illustrates the development of spiritual maturity through the integration of the lessons learned in both the Nigredo and Albedo phases. In some texts, this stage is omitted or merged with the Rubedo stage, making it less defined in the historical context of alchemy.

4. **Rubedo**
The fourth and final stage, Rubedo, or the reddening, signifies the ultimate goal of the alchemical transmutation -- the creation of the Philosopher's Stone. The red lion or tincture is the symbol of this stage, and it represents the magical substance that can turn base metals into gold. Rubedo embodies the perfect union of Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt, symbolizing the harmonious integration of body, soul, and spirit.

On a spiritual level, Rubedo is the culmination of an individual's transformative journey. It signifies the achievement of spiritual and psychological wholeness, self-awareness, and inner balance.

Throughout history, different alchemical texts and traditions offer variations and alternative interpretations of the stages of the Magnum Opus. Some traditions, particularly in Eastern alchemy, lean more towards the spiritual and psychological aspects of transformation, while others focus on the material and physical. By examining these variations and discrepancies, a richer understanding of alchemical philosophy and practices throughout different cultures can be achieved. The Magnum Opus transcends the physical transmutation of metals. It is a symbolic journey of self-discovery and personal transformation. In this light, the Great Work serves not only as a historical artifact but also as a lasting testament to the universal quest for enlightenment and human potential.
