To fully respond to this knowledge challenge and properly explain the distinctive attributes and practices that differentiate a Hermetic Magician, a Wiccan, and a Chaos Magician, it is crucial to first understand the historical, philosophical, and practical roots of each of these diverse traditions. 

Let's begin by exploring the foundations of each tradition, followed by their core tenets, symbols and practices, and finally examine how they differ from each other.

Foundations
1. ****The Hermetic Tradition****: This esoteric tradition traces its roots to ancient Egyptian and Greek philosophical and religious systems, with Hermes Trismegistus being the central figure. Hermes Trismegistus is believed to be a combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, both known for their wisdom and association with writing and magic. The pivotal text in this tradition is the "Corpus Hermeticum" – a compilation of writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, covering topics such as astrology, alchemy, and divine knowledge.

2. ****Wicca****: Wicca is a contemporary form of Neopaganism that emerged in the mid-20th century, largely due to the works of Gerald Gardner and Doreen Valiente. It draws inspiration from various pre-Christian pagan belief systems and borrows elements from Hermeticism, ceremonial magic, and Freemasonry. Wicca is characterized by nature worship, the use of magic, and the veneration of a divine feminine deity known as the Goddess.

3. ****Chaos Magick****: Chaos Magick originated in the late 20th century and has its roots in the works of artists and occultists such as Austin Osman Spare and Peter J. Carroll. The primary philosophy of Chaos Magick is the belief in the efficacy of the practitioner’s will and the notion that belief itself is a tool that can be manipulated to achieve desired outcomes. Chaos Magick tends to emphasize practicality and personal experimentation, often utilizing elements from various sources  to create a unique, individualized magical practice.

Core Tenets, Symbols, and Practices
1. ****The Hermetic Tradition****: Hermeticism is built on the principle of "As above, so below." This idea implies that the universe is a macrocosm of the individual, and vice versa; understanding the self leads to the understanding of the cosmos. Hermetic practices include astrology, divination, and alchemy, and draw upon Qabalah, the Tree of Life, the Emerald Tablet, and the Tarot for symbolism and guidance.

2. ****Wicca****: The key principle of Wicca revolves around the worship of the Goddess and the Horned God, a masculine deity that complements the feminine divine. Wiccans follow the Wheel of the Year, which consists of eight sabbats (festivals) corresponding to the solar calendar and the cycles of the Earth. Magic in Wicca is typically practiced through rituals, invocation, and the use of tools such as the athame (a ceremonial knife), the pentacle, and the chalice.

3. ****Chaos Magick****: Chaos Magick is based on the premise that belief shapes reality. Practitioners experiment with diverse magical systems, often incorporating elements from various sources, including pop culture, to adapt it to their individual needs and desires. Sigils, or magical symbols/stylish representations of intent, are a crucial aspect of Chaos Magick practice, as is the use of altered states of consciousness to enhance the effectiveness of magical workings.

Distinctions
1. Hermetic Magicians are distinguished by their emphasis on the principles of Hermeticism, including the correspondence between the cosmos and the individual, the pursuit of divine wisdom, and a structured path involving the study of astrology, Qabalah, and alchemy.

2. Wiccans are set apart by their reverence for the divine feminine, the Goddess, their focus on the cycles of the Earth and the Wheel of the Year, the practice of nature-based rituals, and the use of magical tools in accordance with Wiccan beliefs.

3. Chaos Magicians are unique in their eclectic and experimental approach to magic, their reliance on the power of belief and individual will, and their incorporation of diverse elements from pop culture and different magical systems, using personal innovation to create their own magical practices.

In conclusion, the key themes and differences between Hermetic Magicians, Wiccans, and Chaos Magicians lie in their respective origins, foundational beliefs, and practices. Hermetic Magicians adhere to the tenets of Hermeticism, emphasizing cosmic correspondence and divine wisdom, while Wiccans follow a nature-based, Goddess-centric, magical practice. Chaos Magicians, on the other hand, prioritize practicality, personal experimentation, and the manipulation of belief in their magical workings. Understanding these distinctions allows for a more nuanced and in-depth comprehension of the rich tapestry of esoteric traditions.
