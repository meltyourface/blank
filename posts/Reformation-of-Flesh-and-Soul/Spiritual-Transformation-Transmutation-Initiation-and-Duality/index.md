In order to thoroughly address the given knowledge challenge, we shall first define and explore the three key concepts: Transmutation in alchemy, the spiritual journey of Initiation, and the concept of Duality. Then, we will analyze the interconnectedness of these ideas and discuss how they can facilitate personal transformation when balanced within the Reformation of Flesh and Soul. 

1. **Transmutation in Alchemy**:
Alchemy, often deemed a precursor to modern chemistry, is a philosophical and protoscientific practice with various goals such as the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, the creation of a panacea (universal remedy), and the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone – a legendary substance capable of turning metals into gold and granting immortality. The process of Transmutation symbolizes a change at the atomic or molecular level, transforming the structure of the subject matter. However, beyond its material aspects, alchemy also holds spiritual dimensions. As individuals work towards personal enlightenment, they metaphorically transmute their base instincts and desires into more evolved thoughts and actions, paralleling the process of transforming base metals into gold.

2. **Spiritual Journey of Initiation**:
Initiation refers to the process of awakening one's inner consciousness through a series of spiritual experiences, trials, or ceremonies that lead to self-discovery and an expanded understanding of the world. The spiritual journey of Initiation often represents a transformative experience, wherein the individual goes through a period of personal growth that involves facing the shadow aspects of oneself. This process ultimately leads to the integration of higher levels of consciousness and a deeper comprehension of the Self and its place in the universe, resulting in spiritual emancipation.

3. **Duality**:
The concept of Duality stems from the belief that there are two opposing yet complementary forces present in the nature of reality. These forces may take various forms, including male and female, light and darkness, positive and negative, or physical and spiritual. The notion of duality implies that one cannot exist without the other, and it is through the integration and harmony of these opposites that individuals can achieve balance and wholeness.

Now that we have a thorough understanding of the aforementioned concepts, let's delve into the interconnectedness of Transmutation, Initiation, and Duality within the context of Reformation of Flesh and Soul.

The Reformation of Flesh and Soul is a journey of personal transformation that encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the human experience. The alchemical process of Transmutation plays a crucial role in this metamorphosis; as individuals move through various stages of spiritual Initiation, they come to understand the concept of Duality in both their internal and external worlds.

By acknowledging and embracing the dual nature within themselves, they can begin the process of Transmutation – letting go of limiting beliefs, transcending destructive behaviors, and working towards a more enlightened state of existence. Duality, in this context, serves as a catalyst for change, encouraging individuals to seek the harmony between the opposing forces found in both their external and internal worlds.

As individuals progress through spiritual Initiation, they become more adept at recognizing and integrating the dual aspects of their nature. This understanding ultimately transcends the limitations of ego and facilitates the Transmutation of their base desires into higher forms of consciousness and action.

To sum up, the interconnectedness of the alchemical process of Transmutation, the spiritual journey of Initiation, and the concept of Duality plays a crucial role in the Reformation of Flesh and Soul. By striving to achieve balance between these aspects, individuals can initiate personal transformation on a profound level, ultimately leading to self-discovery and an expanded understanding of the Self and the universe.
