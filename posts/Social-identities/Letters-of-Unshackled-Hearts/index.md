## Cracked Mirrors

Letter 1:

My Dearest Annabelle,

I find myself writing to you in the solitude of my chamber. For hours I have stared at the parchment, a distant memory of your most recent letter serving as my only company. You asked me how the life back in Simpsonville has been treating me. Well, my beloved, not very well. The town is no longer familiar, and the faces that occupy the squares and courtyards seem to me as masks worn by strangers. Simpsonville has held me in its crucible, and now I fear I cannot recognize my own reflection.

The long-held traditions of this place, once the very foundations of who I once was, now seem to bind me in chains. No longer can I embrace the imposed roles of gender and class, the shackles that once defined me. Father expects me to marry well, for the sake of our family's reputation, and to continue in his footsteps as the town's benefactor. Oh, Annabelle, for how long can one walk a path that isn't theirs?

These expectations are a constant chorus in the hallowed halls, where the shadows of the past and future converge. The portrait of mother, eternally youthful, stares from the walls. Does she watch me pityingly? Does she too long for me to break free from this suffocating norm? My heart shudders as I wonder what fate awaits me.

Sincerely,
Evelyn

Letter 2:

Dearest Evelyn,

Your poignant words bring a heavy burden upon my heart. As you lay bare your anguish, I, too, contemplate the same questions. The expectations we must bear - are they our own, or are they forged by the fires of our world?

Long have I struggled to understand the workings of my own heart, to decipher between my thoughts and the cacophony of voices that reverberate within me, echoing the countless influences in my life. We stand at the crossroads – one path cast in the shadows of imposed norms, and the other leading towards uncharted lands of authenticity.

But we are not alone; for as I write, I see the flicker of candles in the night, each flame a distant soul searching for the same truth. Evelyn, we must find solace in each other's company, amid the chaos that surrounds us. Together, we can dismantle the fetters of tradition that confine us.

Yours eternally,
Annabelle

Letter 3:

My Resolute Annabelle,

Yesterday, as the sun began to set, I walked along the path beside Lake Glasore. Your beautiful words echoed within the golden, hushed stillness. The water reflected the skies above, and yet its depths contained secrets and mysteries beyond one's perception. It reminded me of us, Annabelle, how our lives are expected to be perfect mirrors to the expectations of those who look upon us.

But I have grown tired, dearest, of this charade. We are no longer the parchment upon which our forefathers and mothers have written their expectations and societal norms. We must chart our own course, like the tireless wind that sweeps across the land.

Be my guiding star, Annabelle, and I shall brace the storms that may surround us. Together we will defy the chains of expectation – for we are not just daughters, wives, or heiresses; we are individuals, whose dreams are as vast and splendid as the skies above the lake at twilight.

With undying devotion,
Evelyn
