In order to properly address the knowledge challenge, it's essential to clarify the key terms and concepts that form the basis of this complex subject. In the context of this analysis, we'll focus on the following: 

1. Anti-Cosmic Sorcery
2. Qliphothic Tree of Life
3. Draconian Current
4. Left-Hand Path
5. Self-deification
6. Nightside emanations and adversarial forces

The core principles of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery can be briefly explained as the use of ancient metaphysical techniques to harness energies and forces that go against the established order of the Cosmos, with the ultimate aim to awaken one's inner potentials and attain personal deification. The underlying assumption is that the creation was flawed by a blind demiurge who unwittingly trapped human spirits into material forms, limiting their true divinity. Anti-Cosmic Sorcery seeks liberation from these limitations and a reconnection with one's true, divine essence.

The Qliphothic Tree of Life is an inversion of the widely known Kabbalistic Tree of Life, the structure upon which the spiritual and material worlds are organized. While the Kabbalistic Tree of Life represents the divine order and balance in the Universe, the Qliphothic Tree represents the hidden, darker aspects of reality. It encompasses destructive energies and forces present within creation that are considered necessary components in the transformative journey of the sorcerer. The Qliphothic Tree has ten Qliphoth, or "shells," each being an inversion of a corresponding Sephira in the Tree of Life.

The Draconian Current is a specific Left-Hand Path tradition that focuses on achieving self-deification through a process of internal alchemy, transformation, and ascension. This current often involves working with various spiritual entities, including the central figure of the Dragon. The Draconian Current embraces the full spectrum of light and darkness, synthesizing them as a means to liberation and apotheosis.

As a Left-Hand Path practitioner, one utilizes the principles of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery to overcome the limitations imposed by conventional cosmic order and morality. The Left-Hand Path emphasizes individualism, self-mastery, and the pursuit of personal deification, contrasting the Right-Hand Pathâ€™s commitment to humility, submission, and union with the divine.

Navigating the Nightside emanations, the practitioner encounters various adversarial forces, often represented by demonic entities that challenge their progress and fortitude. However, these forces are not mere obstacles, but also act as teachers, providing crucial lessons and initiation into higher knowledge. By learning to work with the destructive energies within the Qliphothic realms and the Draconian Current, the sorcerer empowers themselves and progresses towards their goal of self-deification.

In conclusion, the core principles of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery, in relation to the Qliphothic Tree of Life and the Draconian current, focus on attaining self-deification and spiritual freedom by delving deep into the hidden, chaotic aspects of existence. Left-Hand Path practitioners engage with the Nightside emanations and adversarial forces to challenge their limitations, ultimately transcending them through transformation and self-empowerment. As a result, the practitioner attains an inner awakening and connection to their authentic divine essence.
