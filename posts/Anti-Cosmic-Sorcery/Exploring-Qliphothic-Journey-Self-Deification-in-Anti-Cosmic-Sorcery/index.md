  Answer:
  
  To thoroughly address the challenge, let us first provide an overview of the essential concepts involved, namely Anti-Cosmic Sorcery, Qliphoth, the Demiurge, and self-deification.
  
  Anti-Cosmic Sorcery refers to a collection of spiritual practices and beliefs aimed at opposing and ultimately transcending the limitations, order, and constraints imposed by the Cosmos, which is seen as both a material and spiritual prison. This path is considered Left-Hand and seeks to empower the individual with the ultimate goal of self-deification or apotheosis.
  
  The Qliphoth (or Qlippoth) are a set of spiritual concepts found primarily within the Jewish Kabbalistic tradition, representing the dark, adverse, or chaotic forces that exist in parallel to the ordered system of the Sefirot, which symbolize the divine process of creation. In the context of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery, the Qliphoth are utilized as a gateway to transcend the limitations imposed by the material universe and its oppressive creator, the Demiurge.
  
  The Demiurge, a term originating from Greek philosophy and further developed in Gnostic tradition, represents a lesser deity or force that created the material world, often associated with trapping humanity and other spirits within the confines of the physical realm. In Anti-Cosmic philosophy, the Demiurge is seen as an obstacle to self-deification and a being of opposition to spiritual freedom and enlightenment.
  
  With this context, we can now delve into the significance of Qliphoth and their role in the pursuit of self-deification. The Qliphoth are the antithesis of the Sefirot. While the latter emanates from the divine and represents the process of creation, the former represents the chaotic, destructive, and transformative forces. The Qliphoth consist of ten layers or realms, each possessing its unique qualities and energies. When working within the Anti-Cosmic Sorcery paradigm, a practitioner or initiate explores and harnesses these energies to free oneself from the confines created by the Demiurge.
  
  The Qliphothic journey, in conjunction with spiritual and magical practices, often involves facing one's deepest fears, weaknesses, and shadow aspects as a catalyst for profound self-transformation. By connecting with the various energies and spirits affiliated with the Qliphoth, an individual learns to understand and embody the untapped potentials that had previously been suppressed, mundane, or denied.
  
  Through each of the ten stations of Qliphoth, the aspirant progressively breaks down the illusory constraints imposed by the Demiurge and unveils a more authentic, powerful, and spiritually liberated form of themselves. These stages require dedication, perseverance, and rigorous transformative work. The ultimate goal is to self-deify, attaining mastery over one's life and inner energies and breaking free from the enslavement to external powers.
  
  In summary, the Qliphoth's significance in Anti-Cosmic Sorcery lies in their representation of the dark, transformative, and chaotic aspects of existence as a means to overcome the Demiurge's cosmic limitations. Through understanding and harnessing these forces, an individual can embark on a path of self-deification, discovering their inner power and transcending the restrictive constructs of the material cosmos. The process of working with Qliphothic energies allows an individual to face and conquer their shadows, leading to profound growth and liberation from imposed boundaries.
