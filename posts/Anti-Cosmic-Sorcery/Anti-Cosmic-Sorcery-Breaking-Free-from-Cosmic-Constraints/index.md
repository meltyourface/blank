The best answer is: Liberation of the individual and eventual disintegration of the cosmos by overcoming the constraining forces of the universe.

Anti-Cosmic Sorcery, also known as Anti-Cosmic Gnosticism or Chaos Gnosticism, is an esoteric tradition that fundamentally rejects the current order and constraints imposed by the Cosmos, with its practitioners seeking to free themselves from these limitations and eventually dissolve the fabric of the universe itself. Theosophically, it often aligns with the belief in a flawed creation or demiurge.

The primary focus of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery is to empower the individual practitioner to overcome the limitations imposed by the cosmic order through magical practices, arcane knowledge, and spiritual ascension. Its adherents often aim to attain personal apotheosis by breaking free from the illusionary constructs that permeate the material universe, such as social conventions, morality, and the linear nature of time.

This tradition takes inspiration from various mythologies and occult systems, such as the Gnostic belief in a fundamentally flawed material world, the Titans and JÃ¶tnar in Greek and Norse mythologies, respectively, who represent primal and chaotic forces opposed to the cosmic order, and the Qliphothic Tree of Death in the Kabbalistic tradition, which represents the dark side of the universe and provides a pathway to the realm beyond cosmic constraints.

To achieve their ultimate goal, practitioners of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery often engage in self-transformative practices, rituals, and meditations that seek to establish a connection between their inner essence and the primordial chaos beyond the constraining boundaries of the cosmos. By embracing the chaos, these sorcerers aim to overcome the inherent limitations of the structured universe, breaking free from the chains that bind them to material existence and ultimately contributing to the dissolution and reabsorption of the cosmos itself.

The other available options do not sufficiently describe the objectives of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery:

1. Transmutation of the self into a spiritually enlightened being through cosmic alignment represents a path of spiritual enlightenment that seeks union with the cosmic order, which is antithetical to the goals and philosophy of Anti-Cosmic Sorcery.

2. Balancing the light and dark aspects of the self to achieve inner harmony is often more associated with concepts such as yin-yang in Eastern philosophy or the equilibrium represented in some Western esoteric traditions, rather than the outright rejection of cosmic constraints in Anti-Cosmic Sorcery.

3. Establishing control over the individual's fate through the shaping and alteration of external realities seems to describe a practice focused on navigating the constraints of the cosmos, whereas Anti-Cosmic Sorcery aims to break free from and ultimately dissolve the very fabric of the universe itself.
