To perform this advanced Dark Magic ritual, we must first gather all necessary materials and tools, choose a suitable location, and prepare the ritual space. Ensure you have a deep understanding and respect for the forces you are working with, as this is a powerful and potent operation.

Materials and tools needed:

1. A large black cloth to create a protective barrier around the ritual space
2. A consecrated ceremonial chalice or vessel filled with an infusion of potent herbs, such as wormwood, henbane, and belladonna, representing the destructive force to be channeled
3. A sigil parchment etched with the specific target's name, birth date, symbols representing their vulnerabilities, and any other relevant details
4. Candles in red, black, and purple representing willpower, destruction, and transformation
5. A ceremonial dagger imbued with the dark arts
6. An image or physical representation of the target

Once all materials are gathered and prepared, choose a location that is isolated and secure. Place the large black cloth on the ground, creating a boundary that will contain the destructive forces being summoned during the ritual.

Step 1: Prepare the ritual space
Within the boundary of the black cloth, arrange the candles in a triangular pattern, with the red at the top, the purple to the left, and the black to the right. Light the candles and place the image or representation of the target at the center of the triangle.

Step 2: Cast protection and prepare for the operation
Recite an incantation for protection, ensuring you remain focused and mindful throughout the ritual:

"In the presence of my dark allies, I call upon the protective forces that surround me. I stand before you, an instrument of destruction, fortified and shielded, as I perform this formidable task."

Step 3: Invoke the malevolent forces
Hold the chalice in your hands, visualizing the potent infusion brimming with dark, destructive energy. Recite the following incantation:

"Awaken, O mighty forces of darkness and chaos! I summon you to heed my command, to hasten the destruction of that which plagues me. Lend me your power and unwavering resolve, so that I may lay waste to the malign entity that afflicts [target's name]."

Step 4: Activation of the sigil parchment
Take the ceremonial dagger and carefully prick your index finger, allowing a drop of blood to fall onto the parchment imbued with the target's vulnerabilities. Meditate and visualize the destructive energies coursing through your body into the sigil, amplifying its potency. As you do this, recite the following incantation:

"By my will and the forces of darkness, I invoke the annihilation of [target's name]'s afflictions, empowering this sigil with the essence of my being and the malevolent forces I wield. Let the destructive energies coursing through me dismantle and obliterate the negative energies that assail this target."

Step 5: Channeling the destructive force and visualization
Hold the empowered sigil parchment above the target's image or representation. Slowly pour the infused contents of the chalice over the target, visualizing the potent destructive stream dissolving and obliterating the negative energies. As you do this, recite the following incantation:

"I project the combined power of the elements and malevolent forces in my grasp, expelling the negativity from [target's name]. As the dark waters descend and extinguish that which has tormented and burdened, I claim victory in this destructive task."

Step 6: Completion and disposal
Allow the infused liquid to thoroughly soak the target's image or representation, ensuring the destructive force has taken effect. Safely extinguish the candles and carefully dispose of the soaked image, sigil, and black cloth outside of the ritual space, burying them in the earth or burning them in a secure location to sever and neutralize any remaining connections.

Step 7: Cleansing and grounding
It is essential to cleanse yourself and the space after performing this ritual to remove any lingering energies. Perform a simple purification ritual, such as taking a cleansing bath with salt or smudging the area with sage. Ground yourself by spending time in nature or practicing meditation to rebalance your energies.

This advanced Dark Magic ritual should be performed with great care and precision, as the destructive forces it harnesses are potent and can have unintended consequences if not handled correctly. Remember always to respect the forces you are invoking and maintain a focused and unwavering intention throughout the operation.
