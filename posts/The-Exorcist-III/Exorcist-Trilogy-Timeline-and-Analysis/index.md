  "The Exorcist III" (1990)
  Directed by: William Peter Blatty
  Screenplay by: William Peter Blatty (based on his novel "Legion")
  
  Main events:
  1. Set 15 years after the original film, a string of gruesome murders in Georgetown mirrors the Gemini Killer's modus operandi, despite his execution 15 years prior.
  2. Lieutenant William Kinderman investigates the murders, leading him to a psychiatric ward housing a mysterious patient resembling the late Father Karras.
  3. The patient, a composite spirit of the Gemini Killer and the deceased Karras, is revealed to be possessed by a demon.
  4. A possessed nurse attempts to kill Kinderman's friend Father Dyer, mirroring the original film's events.
  5. Kinderman confronts the possessed patient and, recalling Father Karras' sacrifice, declares his belief in good triumphing over evil, freeing the spirits of Karras and the Gemini Killer.
  
  Connections and evolution of demonic presence:
  
  1. The demonic statue in "The Exorcist" symbolizes the presence of evil, with Pazuzu being a recurring antagonist throughout the trilogy.
  2. All three films deal with the battle between good and evil, with faith proving essential in overcoming demonic forces.
  3. In "The Exorcist III," the composite spirit of Karras and the Gemini Killer solidifies the connection between the trilogy, demonstrating that both Karras' sacrifice and Pazuzu's influence have rippling consequences.
  4. Thematic motifs include loss of faith, mental health, the struggle for control, and the power of love and friendship.
  
  Directorial visions and storytelling approaches:
  
  1. William Friedkin masterfully conveys an intense sense of fear and tension in "The Exorcist" through stunning visual effects and exceptional performances. The film's exploration of faith, doubt, and the power of evil sets a high standard for the following films.
  2. John Boorman takes a more surreal, metaphysical approach in "The Exorcist II: The Heretic" with a focus on the conflict between demonic entities. However, the film was criticized for veering away from the horrifying realism of the original.
  3. William Peter Blatty returns to authorial control with "The Exorcist III," grounding the story in psychological horror and detective work. While less groundbreaking than the original, "The Exorcist III" is seen as a worthy follow-up that brings the trilogy full circle by acknowledging Karras' sacrifice and emphasizing the importance of faith in the face of evil.
