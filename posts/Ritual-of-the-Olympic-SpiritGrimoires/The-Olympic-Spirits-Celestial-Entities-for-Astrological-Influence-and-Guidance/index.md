The Olympic Spirits are a unique class of spiritual beings, often thought to be planetary intelligences that can be invoked for guidance and the development of spiritual power through the Ritual of the Olympic SpiritGrimoires. The grimoire text "Arbatel of Magic" is the primary source for information on the Olympic Spirits. Their close association with Astrology gives them a significant role in understanding the celestial influences and forces that shape our world and personal destinies.

Each of the seven Olympic Spirits is associated with one of the classical planets in astrology. **These planets, along with their zodiac signs, lend specific characteristics and powers to the respective spirits. Below is a list of each spirit, their corresponding planet and zodiac signs, and their sigils' symbology**:

1. **Aratron (Saturn)**: Ruling over the planet Saturn, Aratron is associated with the zodiac signs Capricorn and Aquarius. In the practice of the Olympic Spirit Grimoires, Aratron is called upon for wisdom, growth, and transformation. His sigil is a complex symbol reflecting the slow, deliberate energy of Saturn and the structure and stability it brings to the world.

2. **Bethor (Jupiter)**: Bethor is linked to the planet Jupiter and the zodiac signs Sagittarius and Pisces. Often invoked for blessings, prosperity, and expansion, Bethor's sigil is composed of elegant, flowing lines that symbolize the expansive and benevolent energy of Jupiter.

3. **Phaleg (Mars)**: Phaleg governs the planet Mars and is connected to the zodiac signs Aries and Scorpio. The spirit is called upon for courage, assertiveness, and the resolution of conflicts. Phaleg's sigil incorporates sharp lines and angles, embodying the aggressive and assertive Martian energy.

4. **Och (Sun)**: Och rules over the Sun and is associated with the zodiac signs Leo. Practitioners may invoke Och for enlightenment, vitality, and creativity. The sigil of Och includes a central circle resembling the Sun surrounded by balanced geometrical shapes, signifying the Sun's life-giving power and its central role in human existence.

5. **Hagith (Venus)**: Hagith is connected to the planet Venus and the zodiac signs Taurus and Libra. Invoke Hagith for matters concerning love, beauty, and harmony. The sigil of Hagith is both symmetrical and delicate, reflecting the elegance and gracefulness of Venus's energy.

6. **Ophiel (Mercury)**: Ophiel is associated with the planet Mercury and the zodiac signs Gemini and Virgo. Invoke Ophiel for improving communication, intellect, and adaptability. Ophiel's sigil is intricate and often fluid in design, reflecting the ever-changing nature of Mercury and its constant movement between the dualities of life.

7. **Phul (Moon)**: Phul rules over the Moon and is connected to the zodiac signs Cancer. Practitioners may call upon Phul for emotional healing, intuition, and psychic abilities.
