## The Rite of Dream Oracle Sigil of PentacleInanna

Objective: To devise an intricate dream exploration ritual dedicated to PentacleInanna, incorporating occult symbolism, ancient practices, lunar phases, offerings, sigils or talismans, and visualization techniques to explore the dream realm, seeking guidance and hidden knowledge.

Materials needed:
1. Sigil of PentacleInanna (designed below)
2. Silver bowl with water
3. Lavender and sage (as offerings to burn)
4. Moonstone (as a talisman)
5. Parchment paper and charcoal
6. A quiet, dark space for the pre-sleep ritual

Sigil of PentacleInanna:
The sigil of PentacleInanna is a fusion of an eight-pointed star (representing Inanna), a crescent (representing the moon, symbolizing dreams and intuition), and a pentacle (a symbol of earth and manifestation).

Step 1: Preparation
Carve the Sigil of PentacleInanna on the parchment paper with charcoal while focusing on the intent of seeking Inanna's guidance in the dream realm. Place the carved sigil under the silver bowl containing water. Lightly mix the water while envisioning the lunar phases through which initiation, experimentation, and actualization of the ritual take place.

Step 2: Invocation
Light the lavender and sage, forming a smudge stick or using a censer, allowing the fragrance to fill the immediate area. During this process, softly chant:

"Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth, Mistress of the Pentacle,
Guide me through the shifting dreams of night, let your wisdom be the light.
Grant your hidden knowledge upon my slumber's sight!"

Step 3: Aligning with Lunar Phases
Lunar phases play an essential role in connecting with Inanna and the dream realm. Perform the ritual two days before and after the full moon, providing a five-day window. Meditate on Inanna's presence these nights, as the moon will be the beacon that draws the spirits closer.

Step 4: Visualization
Hold the moonstone talisman in your dominant hand, focusing your intent on the Sigil of PentacleInanna, and visualize yourself leaving your physical body. Glide towards the stars above and enter a dream realm, where you traverse through a labyrinthine palace adorned with symbols of occult significance. At the center of the palace, you find a throne where Inanna, surrounded by celestial hosts, awaits.

Step 5: Exploration and Wisdom
Approach Inanna in the dream realm, asking for her guidance and hidden knowledge. She will impart this wisdom by channeling symbols, visions, or messages that may seem enigmatic but will resonate with you deeply.

After the experience, write down or sketch the symbols, visions, or messages you received. Meditate on them for further understanding.

Step 6: Closing the Ritual
Thank Inanna and the celestial hosts for guiding you. Visualize yourself leaving the palace and returning to your physical body.

Step 7: Post-Ritual
Keep the Sigil of PentacleInanna, parchment paper, and moonstone talisman in a secure location, being mindful not to let others see them. Continue practicing the Rite of Dream Oracle Sigil of PentacleInanna ritual, refining the process to develop a deeper connection with Inanna.

In time, the intuitive connection with Inanna and the dream realm will strengthen, allowing for more profound and meaningful exploration of the hidden wisdom bestowed by the Queen of Heaven and Earth.
