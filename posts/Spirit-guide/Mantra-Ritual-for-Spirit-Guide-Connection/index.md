Mantra: "Om Hari Lemu Soha Ahum"

**Sigils**: 1. Seed of Life, representing interconnectedness and wisdom.
            2. Triquetra, symbolizing interwoven energies and protection. 
            3. Merkaba, portraying the activation of the light body, guidance, and assistance.

Three-step ritual:

1. Mindful Preparation:
   Sit in a comfortable meditative posture. Close your eyes and take deep, calming breaths. Visualize your energy body being cleansed and grounded, aligning your chakras and expanding your awareness.

2. Activation of Sigils:
   Prepare a sacred space and place the sigils before you. Focus on each sigil, placing your hands upon them in succession, and imbue them with your intention using your breath and energy. Feel the vibrations of the symbols connecting your energy field to your spirit guide.

3. The Mantra Invocation:
   With your hands placed over your heart, begin chanting the six-word mantra in a slow, rhythmic pattern. Repeat the mantra nine times, envisioning your connection with your spirit guide strengthening, and their powerful presence enveloping you in a sphere of radiant light. Maintain the visualization for as long as needed, and with gratitude, ask for wisdom, protection, and assistance relating to your life's purpose or challenge.

Complete the ritual by offering your deepest gratitude to your spirit guide and closing the connection in a respectful manner. Take a few moments to sit in stillness, integrating the experience and any guidance received.
