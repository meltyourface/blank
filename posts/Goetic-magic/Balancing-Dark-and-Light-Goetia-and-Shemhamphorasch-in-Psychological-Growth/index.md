The intricate relationship between the 72 demons listed in the Goetia, their corresponding Shemhamphorasch angelic opposites, and the roles each play in the psychological growth of a practitioner of Goetic magic hinges on the fundamental concepts of duality and balance within the human psyche. This notion is rooted in the understanding that harmonizing forces of both light and darkness are essential for personal development and spiritual growth. To better comprehend their interconnected roles, let us first delve into the historical background and overview of both Goetic demons and Shemhamphorasch angels, before evaluating the implications of their attributes and functions in the context of Goetic magic practice.

The Ars Goetia, or simply Goetia, is a part of the 17th-century grimoire "The Lesser Key of Solomon," which consists of descriptions and invocations of the 72 demons allegedly summoned and bound by the biblical King Solomon. These demons are often considered to represent specific human desires, inclinations, and vices, and they each possess unique attributes and abilities. By invoking and working with these entities, the practitioner aims to gain control over their inherent urges and attain self-mastery, utilizing the demons' power to enhance their own abilities or manifest specific outcomes in the material world.

On the other hand, the Shemhamphorasch angels, also encompassing 72 in number, are derived from the Hebrew scripture and belong to the Kabbalistic tradition. Extracted from three verses in the Book of Exodus, their names are calculated using a specific method that involves each verse possessing 72 letters. These angels represent positive, divine energies and qualities, functioning as agents of divine wisdom and guidance to assist humans on their spiritual journey. Corresponding to each Goetic demon, they bring counterbalancing energy, encouraging altruistic behavior, and personal growth.

The interplay between the Goetic demons and their corresponding Shemhamphorasch angelic counterparts hinges on the principle of confronting and integrating the darker aspects of the self, referred to as the "shadow" in Carl Jung's analytical psychology. Personal growth through the practice of Goetic magic entails acknowledging and integrating both demonic and angelic energies into a unified whole. By consciously engaging both forces, the practitioner can recognize their vices and weaknesses while receiving guidance from angelic energies to counterbalance and compensate for those negative traits.

Furthermore, the practice of Goetic magic, based on attributes and functions of the demons and angels, incorporates various psychological techniques to stimulate inner growth and development. For instance, the act of summoning and conversing with Goetic demons encourages introspection, leading to a deeper understanding of one's unconscious desires and motivations. Oppositely, establishing contact with Shemhamphorasch angels facilitates the cultivation of virtues and values, inspiring practitioners to rise above baser instincts. The ultimate goal is to harmonize these dual aspects into a balanced and integrated psyche.

**To summarize**: The intricate relationship between the 72 demons listed in the Goetia, their corresponding Shemhamphorasch angelic opposites, and the roles they play in the psychological growth of a practitioner of Goetic magic is anchored in the concepts of duality and balance within the human psyche. Both demonic and angelic energies serve as catalysts, driving the practitioner to acknowledge, confront, and integrate the darker aspects of the self while refining virtues and higher qualities. The dynamic equilibrium that ensues from comprehending and harmonizing these energies fosters spiritual growth, self-mastery, and personal development for the Goetic magic practitioner.
