After a deep study of the ancient book of secrets and consulting various astrological charts, I have uncovered the mystical associations and astrological correspondences for the revered artifact known as the "Eternal Amulet of the Astral Serpent."

Symbolic Associations and Elemental Connections:
The Eternal Amulet of the Astral Serpent is an artifact believed to hold the power of the universe, granting its possessor a deeper understanding of cosmic energies and celestial patterns. The amulet is shaped like an ouroboros, a serpent devouring its own tail, symbolizing the endless cycles of creation, destruction, and renewal present in both astrology and nature as a whole.

In terms of elemental connections, the amulet resonates with the element of Ether, also known as the Quintessence or Aether. The Ether is considered the fifth element that binds and transcends the four classical elements - Fire, Water, Air, and Earth - bringing harmony and balance to the bearer of this amulet.

Astrological Correspondences:
The primary zodiac correspondence of the Eternal Amulet of the Astral Serpent is the constellation Ophiuchus, the Serpent-Bearer. As Ophiuchus is often considered the 13th zodiac sign, but not part of the traditional twelve-sign system, it reflects the amulet's connection with the hidden, esoteric knowledge of the cosmos.

The amulet is also associated with the following astrological alignments and celestial influences:

1. Mercury and Jupiter Conjunction: This alignment represents communication and wisdom, enhancing one's ability to access and comprehend the secrets of the universe while wearing the amulet.

2. New Moon in Scorpio: As a water sign, Scorpio embodies the transformative power of emotions and intuition. The new moon amplifies the amulet's power to encourage deep spiritual regeneration and psychic awakening.

3. Saturn in Aquarius: The placement of Saturn, the planet of karmic lessons and discipline, in the innovative and intellectual sign of Aquarius, enables the bearer of the amulet to gain insights from past experiences and apply them to new cosmic understandings.

4. Solstice or Equinox: Equinoxes and solstices mark the transition points between seasons and have been considered powerful times to access spiritual energies. The amulet's power is believed to peak during these moments, aligning its wearer's energies with the cosmos.

Armed with these astrological correspondences and elemental connections, the possessor of the Eternal Amulet of the Astral Serpent can harness the power of this revered artifact to deepen their understanding of both the visible and hidden cosmic forces at play in the celestial realm.
