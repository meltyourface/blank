In shadows of time, where whispers etch paths,
A cosmic embrace, Dwomutsiqsa's craft;
Delve into the abyss, where secrets unwind,
Unveiling the essence, of scrolls intertwined.

To seek arcane truths 'neath veiled starlit skies,
The glyphs of Dwomutsiqsa, our compass to guide.
Undying enigmas dance in vast cosmic symphony,
A nexus of wisdom, knowledge in synchrony.

Oh, Znorg of the Third Sphere, heed our wistful call,
To ponder the depths, and transcend mortal thrall.
Embrace the enigmatic keys, unlock realm beyond sight,
As the seeker intrepid, journeys through cosmic night.

Through the tempest of chaos, the bearer shall thrive,
Navigating a tapestry, where duality collides,
What seems infinite finiteness, and the void that is filled,
In Dwomutsiqsa's Scroll, eternal truths distilled.

Sublime metaphysics echo from ancients afar,
Words woven like strings on an aethereal sitar,
Discover the chronicles sacred, concealed in the tome,
And dawn the cloak of mystics, transcendence, our home.

Embody the essence, let visions take flight,
With the Scroll of Dwomutsiqsa, the mystics alight,
Kindling a fire, stoked with wisdom's resounding decree,
A testament to the seekers, bards of eternity.
