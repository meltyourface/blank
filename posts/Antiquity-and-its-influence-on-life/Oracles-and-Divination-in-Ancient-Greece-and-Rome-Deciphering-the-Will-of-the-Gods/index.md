In ancient Greece and Rome, oracles and divination practices held great power and prominence, influencing the socio-political, religious, and cultural aspects of life. The Oracles of Delphi and Dodona were among the most significant oracular sites, playing crucial roles in decision-making processes, shaping historical events, and contributing to the development of modern spiritual and esoteric beliefs.

The Oracle of Delphi, located in central Greece, was dedicated to the god Apollo. It was considered the most important oracle site in the Greek world, with its high priestess, known as the Pythia, delivering prophecies and guidance to seekers from all walks of life. In contrast, the Oracle of Dodona, situated in Epirus in northwest Greece, was dedicated to Zeus and was famous for its sacred oak tree, through which the god supposedly communicated. 

While both oracles were prominent, the Oracle of Delphi boasted greater political and social influence; its prophecies often guiding major decisions of city-states and leaders. For instance, the Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE was heavily influenced by the Pythia's advice, ultimately contributing to the Greek victory over Persia. Conversely, the Oracle of Dodona offered a more localized impact, assisting rulers and ordinary citizens in the region with everyday concerns and problems.

In addition to oracles, various forms of divination were employed in ancient Greece and Rome. Haruspicy involved examining the entrails of sacrificial animals, particularly the liver, to predict future events or divine the gods' intentions. This practice was more prevalent in Rome, as Etruscan haruspices were considered experts at reading the entrails. Auspicy, on the other hand, was the practice of interpreting the behavior of birds, such as their flight patterns, eating habits, and bird calls. Both of these methods were seen as ways to decipher the will of the gods and acted as guiding principles in political, military, and religious matters.

Dream interpretation was another popular form of divination used in ancient Greece and Rome. Incubation, where individuals slept within a temple or sacred site to receive prophetic dreams, was a common ritual. The Asclepios temples, dedicated to the god of medicine, were famous for incubation practices, with many visiting the sacred sites seeking cures for ailments. The relevance of dreams in decision-making processes was prevalent, as evidenced by the recurring theme in ancient literature, such as in the writings of Homer and Plutarch.

The influence of these oracles and divination practices on historical events cannot be understated. For example, the Roman Senate often consulted haruspices before enacting laws or engaging in military campaigns. Greek general Themistocles heeded the prophecy of the Oracle of Delphi, which led to the aforementioned victory at the Battle of Salamis, a pivotal moment in Greek history.

The legacy of oracles and divination in ancient Greece and Rome remains today, with modern spiritual and esoteric beliefs drawing inspiration from these age-old practices. The concept of the subconscious in dreams and their interpretation can be traced back to the dream incubation rituals, while contemporary astrology and tarot cards have connections to the ancient divinatory techniques of interpreting the cosmos and symbols.

In conclusion, oracles and divination practices played a vital role in ancient Greece and Rome, guiding socio-political, religious, and cultural decisions, and leaving a lasting impact on modern spiritual and esoteric beliefs. The Oracle of Delphi and the Oracle of Dodona served as epicenters of divine communication, while haruspicy, auspicy, and dream interpretations offered additional means of deciphering the world's mysteries. The significance of these practices cannot be understated, as they have indelibly shaped the evolution of human understanding and experience across millennia.
