To examine the interconnections between ancient Gnostic thought, Hermetic philosophy, and the Eleusinian Mysteries, let us first define each of these esoteric doctrines and understand their underlying principles. This will enable us to observe the influences they've had on the individual's spiritual quest and the foundations of Western mystery traditions.

1. **Gnostic Thought**: Often associated with early Christianity, Gnostic thought encompasses a set of religious and philosophical ideas which emphasize personal revelation, self-knowledge, and spiritual liberation in the pursuit of divinity. Gnosticism maintains a dualistic worldview where spirit and matter are fundamentally opposed. It promotes asceticism, mystical experiences, and access to hidden wisdom through the deciphering of secret texts or teachings.

2. **Hermetic Philosophy**: Considered one of the earliest occult traditions, Hermetic philosophy emerges from a collection of texts called the Corpus Hermeticum, attributed to the figure of Hermes Trismegistus. Hermeticism integrates principles from Greek philosophy, Egyptian mysticism, astrology, and alchemy. At its core, it embarks on a search for ultimate enlightenment and spiritual transformation through the reconciliation of opposites and the comprehension of divine or universal laws.

3. **Eleusinian Mysteries**: These were initiation rites of the ancient Greek world, held in Eleusis, dedicated to the goddesses Demeter and Persephone. The detailed nature of the ceremonies and rituals remains mostly unknown, as initiates pledged to maintain secrecy. The Mysteries aimed at conferring a transformative experience or spiritual awakening, related to Persephone's annual descent into the underworld and her subsequent return, symbolizing the rebirth and renewal of life.

Interconnections:

A) Esoteric Knowledge: The Gnostic, Hermetic, and Eleusinian traditions each offer exclusive contentions of acquiring wisdom and spiritual awareness, concealed from the uninitiated. In Gnostic thought, it is the revelation of hidden texts and teachings, while Hermetic philosophy unfolds universal laws. The Eleusinian Mysteries achieved similar ends by bestowing initiates with direct, divine experience.

B) Transformation of the Self: The individual's spiritual quest is central to these esoteric doctrines, postulating that spiritual evolution emerges from personal transformation. Gnostic thought advocates self-knowledge and spiritual liberation, Hermetic philosophy strives for enlightenment through embracing divine laws, and the Eleusinian Mysteries direct initiates towards profound metamorphoses through immersive experiences.

C) Symbolism and Allegory: All three doctrines employ allegorical representations, symbolic imagery, and mythos to express metaphysical ideas. Gnostic texts often couch their teachings in metaphors, allegory, and scripture reinterpretation. Similarly, Hermeticism and its association with alchemy employ symbolism for illustrating the stages of spiritual growth and transformation. The Eleusinian Mysteries utilized mythological narratives of Demeter and Persephone to represent the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

D) Influence on Western Mystery Traditions: Elements from Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and Eleusinian Mysteries can be seen in subsequent Western esoteric currents, such as alchemy, Kabbalah, and Rosicrucianism. These traditions often borrowed, merged, and adapted concepts, practices, and teachings from these ancient sources, shaping Western occultism in various forms.

In conclusion, ancient Gnostic thought, Hermetic philosophy, and the Eleusinian Mysteries are interconnected in their pursuit of experiential, transformative knowledge. They converge upon the concept of spiritual evolution, emphasizing the individual's quest for enlightenment. Through their secretive nature, allegorical expressions, and metaphysical themes, these doctrines have significantly contributed to the development of Western mystery traditions in antiquity and beyond.
