- The mystery schools of ancient Greece and Egypt, providing esoteric teachings and secret initiations to seekers of hidden knowledge.

The esoteric and mystery schools of ancient Greece and Egypt have had the most profound influence on contemporary life and spiritual practices. During the times of ancient Greece and Egypt, mystery schools were extremely influential in shaping the society's understanding of the world, spirituality, and the self. These schools provided teachings and initiations that were considered sacred, exclusive, and only made available to a select few who were considered worthy.

These mystery schools explored esoteric concepts and teachings that were seen as holding the key to a deeper understanding of life and the cosmos. Some prominent mystery schools include the Eleusinian and Orphic Mysteries in ancient Greece, as well as the Egyptian mysteries taught by Thoth and Isis. The teachings from these schools were greatly influenced by the cultures they emerged from and often delved into the study of sacred symbols, cosmology, mathematics, astrology, and alchemy.

Throughout history, the influence of these ancient mystery schools can be observed in various cultural, religious, and spiritual practices. The Gnostic movement in the early Christian years, as well as the teachings of Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Rosicrucianism, all have their roots in the ancient mysteries. In addition, many secret societies such as the Freemasons and the Knights Templar have been influenced by the ancient mystery school traditions.

The reason for the profound influence of these mystery schools is that they provided a guerilla knowledge base that is directly connected to the spiritual experiences of the human condition. This esoteric information retains its relevancy, as it offered individuals a path to seek out hidden truths and gain a deeper understanding of their purpose in life.

As for the other options, while they also contain elements of antiquity that have influenced contemporary life and spiritual practices, it can be argued that they do not hold the same level of impact as the mystery schools. The concept of correspondences and the doctrine of signatures are important principles, but they exist as components within the greater framework of the mystery schoolsâ€™ teachings.

The use of sacred geometry and numerology in ancient monuments has undoubtedly left an imprint on society and various spiritual practices. Such principles have been used in the construction of sacred spaces throughout history and continue to influence modern architecture. However, their impact is more localized and doesn't penetrate the core of spiritual practices as deeply as the mystery schools.

Lastly, the worship of multiple deities and the practice of seeking divine favor through rituals and offerings is a significant part of many ancient and contemporary religious and spiritual practices. However, these practices often exist in a more exoteric form and do not delve into the same depths of hidden knowledge that the mystery schools offer.

In conclusion, the mystery schools of ancient Greece and Egypt have had the most profound influence on contemporary life and spiritual practices due to the nature of the teachings they provided and their focus on understanding the deeper spiritual truths of existence. The initiation process in these schools enabled select individuals to work towards self-realization and spiritual advancement, influencing the foundations of many spiritual and esoteric practices that continue to shape modern spirituality.
