To answer this knowledge challenge, let us delve into the intricate web of the Dionysian initiation rites, the architectural elements and frescoes of the Villa of the Mysteries, and their combined influence on the initiates' journey towards societal integration and esoteric understanding. We will begin by first examining each individual component before synthesizing their relationships and ultimate purpose.

The Dionysian Initiation Rites:
These rites revolved around the ancient Greek god Dionysus, the god of wine, fertility, and theater. His cult was known for its ecstatic rituals and the belief in personal transformation through the sacred knowledge of mystery. The Dionysian mysteries aimed to bring initiates to a higher state of consciousness and help them explore the deeper aspects of their existence. This aspect of the initiation rites can be likened to a caterpillar spinning a cocoon and emerging as a butterfly. The initiate, like the caterpillar, undergoes a profound transformation, both spiritually and mentally, which in turn leads to the development of a new identity and societal status.

The Architecture of the Villa of the Mysteries:
One cannot divorce the importance of the architectural design of the Villa from the discussions on the Dionysian rites that occurred within its walls. The Villa of the Mysteries, located near the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, showcases a highly developed sense of spatial organization and harmonious balance, evidenced by the rooms' arrangement around a central courtyard or peristyle. This interplay of spatial elements guides the initiates' journey, creating a path leading them sequentially through the rooms, each one enriched with hidden esoteric knowledge. Here, the architectural layout of Villa can be viewed as a living representation of the psychological transformation that occurs throughout the Dionysian initiation process, where the internal and external journeys are interwoven.

The Frescoes of the Villa of the Mysteries:
To complete our understanding of the interconnectedness of the Dionysian initiation rites, Villa of the Mysteries, and their impact on initiates, it's imperative to discuss the frescoes. These striking and powerful images adorn the walls of the Villa, depicting various scenes that embody the mysteries of initiation. Many scholars believe that the frescoes illustrate the stages of initiation and offer insights into the rites of the Dionysian cult. Examining these frescoes, one can interpret them as a visual diary that captures a narrative, allowing initiates to enter the mystical world of the rites both mentally and spiritually. 

Interconnectedness and Ultimate Purpose:
Having delved into the individual components, we can now explore their interconnectedness and ultimate purpose. The Dionysian initiation rites provide a framework of esoteric wisdom and transformational power that links the architectural layout and frescoes of the Villa of the Mysteries. The architecture, with its purposeful design, shapes the initiates' physical journey, while the frescoes create a parallel narrative and spiritual experience. This harmonized union of rites, architecture, and frescoes immerses the initiates in an intricate dance designed to reveal hidden knowledge and reshape their identity.

In terms of societal integration, the initiation rites allowed the initiates to elevate their status within the community, gaining newfound respect and understanding in the process. This elevation, in turn, fosters a sense of unity, as the rites serve as a shared bond among those who have undergone the transformation. For the individual initiate, the esoteric understanding obtained through the rites enables them to become more conscious and spiritual beings, transcending the mundane aspects of their previous existence to embrace a higher plane of awareness.

In summary, the Dionysian initiation rites, the architecture of the Villa of the Mysteries, and the frescoes found within it, all form an intricate tapestry of interconnected elements that guide initiates towards societal integration and esoteric understanding. The rites establish a framework of sacred wisdom, while the Villa's architecture and frescoes contribute to a layered and immersive experience that elevates the initiate's identity and role in the larger society. Together, they serve the ultimate purpose of not only fostering spiritual growth but also binding individuals into a collective that transcends division and hierarchy.
