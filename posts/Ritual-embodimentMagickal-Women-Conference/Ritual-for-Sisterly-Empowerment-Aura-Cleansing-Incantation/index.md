Incantation for Aura Cleansing at Ritual Embodiment Magickal Women Conference:

By the power of the sacred feminine, we embrace,
Summoning the ancient wisdom our souls encase,
Goddesses united, our light entwines and ascends,
Purify our auras, as sisterly energy transcends.

Artemis, Diana, Hecate, and Freyja combine,
Moonbeams of power, let us realign,
Sisters of enchantment, veils now release,
Revealing our strength, our purpose, our peace.

Elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water cleanse,
Unified by the Spirit, we heal and amends,
Empowerment and love, our spirits ignite,
In sisterhood's embrace, we flourish by Spirit's light.

Gestures and Movements:

1. Participants stand in a circle, holding hands. The individual leading the incantation gently squeezes the hand of the person on their left as each verse is completed, creating a wave of energy that flows through the circle.

2. As the incantation mentions each goddess, reproduce the gestures associated with each deity:
- Artemis: Draw an imaginary bow and arrow.
- Diana: Spread arms wide in a welcoming gesture.
- Hecate: Place palms together and then open them outward, as if unveiling a hidden object.
- Freyja: Reach towards the sky and then bring hands to heart center, demonstrating spiritual connection.

3. At the line "Elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water cleanse," touch the ground (Earth), wave hands in the air (Air), form a ball with hands as if holding a flame (Fire), and make a fluid, wavelike motion (Water).

4. For the final verse, clasp hands together over the heart, symbolizing sisterhood and empowerment.

Ritual Tools and Sacred Objects:

1. A center altar or sacred space with representations of each goddess (e.g., sacred artifacts, images, or symbols).

2. A chalice of water blessed by the moon and infused with crystals to represent the element Water.

3. A dish of salt or soil for the element Earth.

4. Incense or a feather for the element Air.

5. A candle or lavender wand for the element Fire.

6. A circle of flowers or crystals that encompass the entire ritual area, symbolizing the protective sphere of sisterhood and spiritual growth.
