## Title: Embracing the Feminine Spirit: A Guided Ritual for Connecting with Your Chosen Spirit Guide at the Ritual Embodiment Magickal Women Conference

Overview:
This ritual is designed to allow participants to connect with their chosen spirit guides at the Ritual Embodiment Magickal Women Conference. Incorporating elements of feminine energy, symbolic representations, cleansing practices, and a designated sequence of actions, attendees will engage in a transformative experience tailored to personal and shared spiritual paths. 

Preparation:
1. Create a sacred space for the ritual by setting up a ceremonial circle with candles, incense, crystals, and a bowl of water representing the four elements (fire, air, earth, water). Ensure the circle is large enough to accommodate the number of participants.
2. Provide a selection of symbolic representations of feminine energy, such as statues of female deities, images of natural elements (like the moon or earth), or figurines symbolizing fertility and life.
3. Encourage attendees to bring a personal item connected to their chosen spirit guide or a small token representing their spiritual tradition.

Cleansing Practices:
1. Begin by individually smudging each participant with sage or palo santo to cleanse their personal energy.
2. Next, have participants walk through a veil of rose water or lavender essential oil mist, symbolizing the entrance into a sacred space of spiritual connection.
3. Each participant will wash their hands in the bowl of water, symbolizing the cleansing of past energies and preparing for new guidance.

Sequence of Actions for Solo Embodiment:

1. Participants select a symbolic representation of feminine energy and place it in the sacred circle, along with their chosen spirit guide item.
2. Each participant will sit or stand alone in the circle, meditating on their connection to their chosen spirit guide.
3. Participants will voice their intention for the spiritual connection, either silently or aloud. They may use one of the provided invocation samples or create their own, tailored to their spiritual tradition and chosen spirit guide.
4. Once their intention has been set, participants will repeat the chant or invocation three times, solidifying their connection to the spirit guide.
5. Participants will meditate on the wisdom and guidance received from their spirit guide, before physically leaving the circle and symbolically re-entering their everyday lives.

Sequence of Actions for Group Embodiment:
1. Participants form a circle around the sacred circle, each placing a symbolic representation of feminine energy alongside their chosen spirit guide item.
2. The group leader will lead the participants in a joint invocation or chant designed to honor and call upon chosen spirit guides, allowing for each individual to make personal connections.
3. Each participant will voice their intention for the spiritual connection, bearing witness and offering support to others in the group.
4. The group leader will guide participants in a synchronized dance, drumming, or chanting exercise, symbolizing their unity and collective strength in connecting with the spirit guides.
5. Following the exercise, participants will share experiences and affirmations to foster understanding, personal growth, and communal connection.

Sample Invocations and Chants for Various Spiritual Traditions:

- "Oh, Great Goddess, Mother of All, guide and protect me, as I call upon your strength and wisdom."
- "Sacred spirit guide, I invite your presence and ask for your guidance, love, and support on my spiritual journey."
- "Ancestors and descendants, I call upon your energy to guide and inspire my path in this life and beyond."

Suitable Offerings:
1. Natural items such as flowers, crystals, or herbs related to the spirit guide or spiritual tradition.
2. Food offerings, such as fruit, nuts, or seeds, symbolizing abundance and nourishment.
3. Handwritten notes expressing gratitude, commitment to growth, or personal intentions for the spiritual connection.

Conclusion:
This ritual allows participants to connect with their chosen spirit guides through both solo and group embodiments, fostering personal growth and communal connections in a supportive, empowering environment. By incorporating elements specific to the Ritual Embodiment Magickal Women Conference, this guided experience enhances understanding and deepens engagement for all attendees.
