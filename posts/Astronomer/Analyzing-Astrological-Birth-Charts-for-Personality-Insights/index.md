To analyze and interpret the recurring geometrical patterns within an astronomical birth chart and explore their astrological implications, celestial alignments, and impact on personality traits, while incorporating advanced techniques such as aspects, transits and secondary progressions, we first need a birth chart to work with. Let's assume we have a natal chart for a person born on January 1, 2000, at 12:00 PM (noon) in New York City, USA.

1. **Birth Chart**: Using the given date, time, and location, we can generate a natal chart, which is essentially a snapshot of the celestial positions at the time of birth.

2. **Geometrical Patterns**: Examine the chart to identify significant geometrical patterns formed by multiple aspects between planets. Common patterns include the Grand Trine, Yod, T-Square, and Grand Cross.

For instance, in this hypothetical chart, we notice a Grand Trine formed by the Moon in Cancer, Pluto in Sagittarius, and Neptune in Pisces. This indicates an innate talent for connecting with others on a deep, emotional level and shows potential for spiritual growth.

3. **Aspects**: Analyze the aspects (angular relationships) between the planets and points in the chart. There are major aspects, such as conjunctions, oppositions, squares, trines, and sextiles. Additionally, minor aspects like semi-sextiles, quintiles, and quincunxes play a role in the interpretation.

For example, if the person's Sun is in opposition to their Moon, it can indicate a conflict between their conscious and unconscious selves, leading to potential personal growth through self-awareness.

4. **Transits**: Examine how current planetary positions (transits) interact with the natal chart. Transits can activate or trigger specific areas of a person's life.

For instance, a current transit of Saturn conjunct the natal Sun may signify a period of hard work, responsibility, or life lessons for the individual.

5. **Secondary Progressions**: Assess the symbolic movement of the planets and points in the chart. Secondary progressed planets mirror the internal, psychological growth of a person over time, and their interaction with the natal chart can reveal significant changes or events.

In our example, suppose the secondary progressed Sun forms a conjunction with the natal Jupiter. This can indicate a period of increased optimism, opportunities, and personal expansion for the individual.

6. **Personality Analysis**: Taking all the above factors into account, we can now interpret the astrological influences on the individual's personality. For instance, with a strong emphasis on Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), the person may have a practical, grounded, and security-oriented disposition.

Given the Grand Trine, Sun opposition Moon, and other relevant aspects, we can also determine the individual may be emotionally expressive, have heightened intuition, struggle with internal conflicts, and possess a strong will to overcome obstacles.

By analyzing and interpreting these recurring geometrical patterns, aspects, transits, and secondary progressions within the birth chart, we can gain valuable insight into the astrological implications, celestial alignments, and their impact on an individual's personality traits.
