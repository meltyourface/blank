To unravel the hidden correlations between the mythological narratives attached to the constellation Orion and its most prominent star, Betelgeuse, it is essential to explore different aspects including sacred geometry, astrological influences, and symbolism in ancient civilizations. This allows us to delve into the complexities and establish connections that bridge these practices and concepts. 

Mythological narratives:

Orion, one of the most recognizable constellations in the sky, has been a central figure in several mythologies across various civilizations. In Greek mythology, Orion is portrayed as a mighty hunter, accompanied by his two dogs (Canis Major and Canis Minor), pursuing the celestial animals (Taurus, Lepus, and others). Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star, marks the right shoulder of the hunter and is the tenth brightest star in the sky. Given its prominence, it is not unusual for ancient civilizations to attribute mystic symbolism to both Orion and Betelgeuse.

Sacred geometry:

Sacred geometry refers to geometric shapes and patterns that bear spiritual and symbolic significance. Looking at the layout of Orion, one could notice the alignment of its three central stars, known as Orion's Belt, which points to the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, located in the Canis Major constellation. This alignment echoes the layout of the three pyramids of Giza in Egypt, which suggests that the architects were inspired by Orion's configuration.

Furthermore, the distance between Betelgeuse and the central stars in Orion's Belt (Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka) forms an isosceles triangle. Triangles are found in several examples of sacred geometry, particularly the Pythagorean theorem and equilateral triangle that represent harmony, balance between mind, body, and spirit, and the principle of "As above, so below."

Astrological influences:

In ancient astrology, Orion was believed to have a dual nature, representing both light and darkness. Considering its significance as a hunter, it was perceived as a protective force against danger and disorder. Betelgeuse, however, has been associated with martial characteristics due to its reddish hue, which was linked with Mars, the god of war. Ptolemy believed that while Betelgeuse signaled fortune, the overall influence of Orion could be destructive.

Symbolism in ancient civilizations:

In Egyptian mythology, Orion was identified with Osiris, the god of the afterlife. The soul of Osiris was believed to reside in the star Sirius, further emphasizing the connection between Orion and Sirius. The association of Betelgeuse with Orion/Osiris suggests that it may have played a part in the resurrection myth, signifying the renewal and cyclical nature of life.

The Sumerians identified Orion with Gilgamesh, a hero-king who went through various trials and tribulations, symbolizing the eternal quest for immortality. It is conceivable that the prominence of Betelgeuse within Orion might represent an essential aspect of this journey, embodying strength and persistence necessary for overcoming challenges.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the connections between the mythological narratives of Orion and Betelgeuse, sacred geometry, astrological influences, and symbolism in ancient civilizations reveal intricate layers of meaning embedded within the constellation and its prominent star. Orion's alignment with the pyramids of Giza, the harmonic geometry presented within its formation, and its astrological attributes of both protection and destruction, showcase the multifaceted nature of this constellation's significance across various cultures. Betelgeuse's association with Mars, along with its potential role within resurrection myths, reflects the duality and complexity of the star. Overall, the interplay between Orion and Betelgeuse embodies an eternal human fascination with the mysteries of the cosmos, encompassing the fundamental concepts of life, death, and humanity's place within the universe.
