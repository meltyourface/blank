Introduction:
To comprehensively understand the impact of dissenting personalities like Aleister Crowley and Helena Blavatsky on the modern spiritual landscape, it is important to break down their contributions into various facets discussed in the question: amalgamation of Eastern and Western mystical traditions, societal views on occult practices, and relevance in contemporary esoteric movements.

Amalgamation of Eastern and Western Mystical Traditions:

Aleister Crowley was an influential occultist, mystic, and ceremonial magician who was a key member of several esoteric organizations, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). He played an essential role in integrating Eastern and Western mystic ideas. Crowley's interest in Eastern thought was primarily directed towards yogic practices, Buddhism, and Hinduism, which he encountered during his travels through Asia. His work "Liber ABA" is a comprehensive treatise on Magick, exploring yoga as one of the essential techniques in the West.

Helena Blavatsky, on the other hand, was the co-founder of the Theosophical Society. She claimed to have studied under Eastern spiritual masters and attempted to bridge the gap between Eastern mystic practices and Western occultism. By introducing theories such as karma, reincarnation, and higher states of consciousness, Blavatsky's work provided Western spiritual seekers with an in-depth understanding of Eastern esoteric wisdom. Her most important works, "The Secret Doctrine" and "Isis Unveiled," elaborated on these ideas and served as cornerstones for blending Eastern and Western spiritual concepts.

Shift in Societal Views on Occult Practices:

Crowley and Blavatsky both sought to question and challenge conventional religious beliefs and practices. Crowley's infamous motto, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," emphasized the importance of following one's own spiritual path and true will outside of traditional religious confines. As a result, both figures played a crucial role in shifting societal views on occult practices. The counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence of interest in Crowley and Thelema, which has had lasting effects on the perception of the occult today.

Blavatsky, through the Theosophical Society, promoted the idea that spiritual wisdom could and should be acquired through personal experiences and direct interactions with the divine. This called for a direct spiritual connection rather than relying on organized religious institutions or intermediaries. This constituted a shift in societal views on occult practices as it encouraged spiritual seekers to engage in self-exploration and experimentation with esoteric beliefs and practices, including those of Eastern origin.

Relevance of Their Philosophies in Contemporary Esoteric Movements:

Crowley and Blavatsky's philosophies and practices continue to impact contemporary esoteric movements like modern witchcraft, occultism, and chaos magick. Crowley's concept of True Will is often integrated into modern pagan and Wiccan practices as both personal empowerment and spiritual guidance. His involvement with the OTO has led to the growth and resurgence of the organization, with Thelema considered an essential belief system in many esoteric groups.

Blavatsky's Theosophy is still relevant to many New Age movements and remains influential in popularizing Eastern philosophical concepts in the West. The concept of Ascended Masters and the idea of spiritual evolution have their roots in Blavatsky's work, which continue to inform contemporary spiritual thought.

**Conclusion**:
In the context of occultism and esotericism, dissenting personalities such as Aleister Crowley and Helena Blavatsky have had a profound and lasting impact on the modern spiritual landscape by synthesizing Eastern and Western mystical traditions, influencing societal views on occult practices, and shaping philosophies that are integrated into contemporary esoteric movements. Both figures demonstrated that spiritual wisdom transcends cultural and geographical boundaries, challenging conventional religious beliefs and encouraging spiritual seekers to explore and engage in esoteric practices for personal growth and self-empowerment. As a result, their work continues to inspire modern spiritual exploration, leading to a diverse and evolving spiritual landscape.
