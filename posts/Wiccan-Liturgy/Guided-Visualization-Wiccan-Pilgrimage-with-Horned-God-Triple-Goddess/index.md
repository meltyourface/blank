## A Pilgrimage to Commune with the Horned God and Triple Goddess

Introduction

Join us on a mystical journey to commune with the Horned God and Triple Goddess through this guided visualization rooted in Wiccan Liturgy. The path ahead is filled with enchanting landscapes, profound symbolism, and powerful encounters with the Divine.

Setting Proper Ritual Space

1. Begin by creating a sacred space to perform this guided visualization. Choose a quiet area where you can relax and be at ease.

2. Cleanse the space by burning sage or incense, or using a cleansing ritual chant, such as: "By the powers of the sacred elements, I banish all negative energy from this space."

3. Set up an altar using representations of the four elements â€“ Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Place a small bowl of soil, a feather, a candle, and a cup of water to represent each element respectively.

4. Add symbols of the Horned God and Triple Goddess, such as a stag horn, moonstone, or a statue of the Goddess in her Maiden, Mother, and Crone forms.

5. As you light the candle, say this invocation prayer: "Blessed be this sacred space. As I journey within, may I be protected, guided, and graced with the presence of the Divine. So mote it be."

Guided Visualization

Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath.

1. Envision yourself standing in a lush forest, surrounded by the energy of the four elements - Earth beneath your feet, Air whispering through the leaves, Fire warming your skin as the sun's rays dance between the branches, and Water flowing gently through a nearby stream.

2. Begin to walk deeper into the forest, feeling the power of the elements growing stronger with each step. As you venture further, you notice a stone altar adorned with symbols of the Horned God and Triple Goddess. Approach the altar and kneel, grounding yourself in the energy of the Divine.

3. Whisper a prayer, inviting the Horned God and Triple Goddess to accompany you on this pilgrimage. Then, rise and continue walking with the newfound awareness of their guiding presence.

4. Enter a clearing where a great Wheel of the Year stands tall, marking the ever-changing cycle of seasons. As the wheel turns, acknowledge the ebb and flow of life, and how it mirrors your own spiritual journey.

5. Continue forward until you reach a circle of stones. Within this circle, people in colorful robes gather, performing the Spiral Dance. Join them in this ancient ritual, weaving in and out of the circle, celebrating the unity of all beings.

6. As the dance concludes, you find yourself before a majestic throne, flanked by two oak trees - one bearing the Horned God's visage, the other the forms of the Triple Goddess. Take a moment to acknowledge their presence and receive any messages they have for you.

7. Thank the Horned God and Triple Goddess for their guidance and wisdom on this journey. As you do, notice the soft glow enveloping you, symbolic of their blessings.

8. Retrace your steps, absorbing the powerful experiences of your pilgrimage. As you re-enter the forest clearing, feel the connection with the Divine lingering within your heart.

9. Take a few deep breaths and, when you are ready, slowly open your eyes, bringing your awareness back to the present.

Conclusion

By taking part in this guided visualization, you have made a sacred pilgrimage to connect with the Horned God and Triple Goddess. Embrace the wisdom, guidance, and blessings received during this sacred journey, and carry forth these insights to enrich every aspect of your life. Blessed be.
