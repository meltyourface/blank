Spell: The Abundance Beacon

Desired Outcome: To attract prosperity and wealth while offering protection from psychic attacks.

Ingredients:
1. Green or gold candle (to symbolize prosperity)
2. Small bag or pouch (to contain and focus the energies)
3. Pyrite, citrine, and green aventurine (crystals for attracting prosperity)
4. Basil, cinnamon, and clove (herbs for prosperity and protection against negative energies)
5. Dragon's blood (resin for powerful protection and banishing negativity)
6. A silver coin or piece of currency (representing the desired abundance)
7. Salt (for purification and protection)

Sigil: Design a sigil that incorporates the rune Fehu (for wealth, prosperity, and abundance), the Eye of Horus (protection against negative energies), and the infinity symbol (endless abundance). Draw this sigil on a small piece of paper.

Lunar phase and astrological alignment: Execute the spell during a waxing moon or a full moon in the sign of Taurus, as it is an earth sign associated with wealth, abundance, and stability.

Procedure:
1. Begin by cleansing your space with the smoke of dragon's blood resin or by sprinkling salt around the area. 
2. Cast a circle or visualize a protective energy barrier around you to guard against negative energies and psychic attacks during the ritual. 
3. Light the green or gold candle, and focus on the flame, saying: "I invoke the power of fire to illuminate the path to abundance and to ward off negativity." 
4. Place the crystals, herbs, and silver coin or currency in the small pouch. Hold the pouch in both hands and envision abundant wealth and prosperity flowing into your life, protected from all negativity by a force field of energy. 
5. Place the sigil designed for the spell in front of the candle, allowing the flame to activate its power. State your intent using the original incantation: 

"By the ancient wisdom, and powers of today,
I call forth abundance, prosperity my way.
In this beacon of power, a charm secure,
Wealth unbounded, protection I'm sure.

With Fehu, Eye of Horus, and eternal embrace,
Prosperity's spell, in harmony encased.
By the waxing moon, and Taurus aligned,
The forces I seek, together combined."

6. Once you feel the energy of your spell amassed, close the circle or release the energy barrier, letting the energy of the spell radiate outward and manifest the desired outcome.
7. Keep the pouch with you or place it in a significant location, such as your wallet or a place of business. The spell may need time to manifest but always trusts the process.

Remember to show gratitude for the prosperity you receive and seek ways to use your wealth mindfully, as energy is exchanged and circulated in the collective.
