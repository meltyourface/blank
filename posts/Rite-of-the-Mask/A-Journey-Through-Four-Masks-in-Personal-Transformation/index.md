To thoroughly respond to this knowledge challenge, it is crucial first to identify the four primary masks representing different aspects of the human experience in the Rite of the Mask. Following their identification, we will analyze their roles in an individual's journey through self-discovery, personal transformation, and integration within both microcosm and macrocosm of the universe.

The four primary masks within the Rite of the Mask are:
1. **The Mask of Innocence**
2. **The Mask of Duality**
3. **The Mask of Truth**
4. **The Mask of Wholeness**

1. The Mask of Innocence:
This mask represents the pure, unadulterated state of being that exists before any social conditioning or external influence takes place. It embodies our original self – the pure, fundamental essence of who we were when we first came into existence. In self-discovery, it represents the journey to reclaim the innate wisdom, creativity, and spontaneity that has been lost through societal conditioning.

The Mask of Innocence holds power in the individual's personal transformation by providing a sense of grounding and connection to the primordial core of one's being. By reconnecting with this innocence, they can free themselves from the weight of external expectations, allowing for more authentic self-expression and a re-emergence of natural talents and intuition. In terms of integration within the microcosm and macrocosm of the universe, the Mask of Innocence represents the individual's connection to the primordial energy that permeates all existence, thereby permitting conscious interaction with the universe's intricate web.

2. The Mask of Duality:
The Mask of Duality reflects the inherent dual nature of human experience – the opposing forces within and around us, such as light and darkness, life and death, or creation and destruction. This mask serves as a reminder that growth and transformation arise from exploring and embracing the complexities of our dual nature instead of resisting and avoiding these complexities.

By understanding and accepting duality, an individual embarks on a journey towards harmony and unity by finding balance and synthesis between opposing forces. In personal transformation, the recognition of duality offers opportunities for growth and evolution, as it challenges individuals to confront their shadows and engage in the self-reflection necessary for healing old wounds. The integration aspect involves recognizing that the microcosm (individual) and macrocosm (universe) both experience duality, facilitating interconnectedness and unification with the greater cosmic cycles and patterns that govern all existence.

3. The Mask of Truth:
This mask emphasizes the search for ultimate knowledge and wisdom, transcending the limitations imposed by illusions, misconceptions, and falsehoods. It encourages persistent questing for one's authentic self, unmasking the deceptive narratives held within the psyche.

The role of the Mask of Truth in self-discovery is to help individuals penetrate the constructs, stories, and limiting beliefs that constrain their true potential. Through discernment and courage, they seek clarity and alignment with their genuine selves, promoting personal growth and transformation. The Mask of Truth urges individuals to acknowledge the interdependence and interconnectedness of all beings, allowing for greater understanding and integration within the microcosm and macrocosm of the universe.

4. The Mask of Wholeness:
The final mask symbolizes the culmination of the individual's journey – the integration and unification of all aspects of the self, embracing both light and shadow to form a cohesive, harmonious whole. This mask embodies the wisdom, inner-healing, and self-realization acquired through the mastery of the other masks.

When worn, the Mask of Wholeness signifies the individual's attainment of self-mastery and transformation, having transcended duality and restored their true essence. In terms of integration within the microcosm and macrocosm, the Mask of Wholeness exemplifies the unity and interdependence of all life, inviting individuals to embody their roles as conscious and fully-realized co-creators within the grand cosmic order.

In conclusion, the Rite of the Mask explores the roles of the four primary masks of Innocence, Duality, Truth, and Wholeness in guiding an individual's journey through self-discovery, personal transformation, and integration within the universe's microcosm and macrocosm. By attaining mastery over these masks, an individual can reconnect with their primordial essence, embrace their dual nature, discern falsehoods from reality, and ultimately achieve wholeness and harmony within the context of both self and universe.
