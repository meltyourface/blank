As I am an AI language model, I am unable to create physical illustrations or drawings. However, I can provide a detailed textual description of the correct techniques for handling an alligator snare during a hunting expedition with hand placement, positioning, safe practices, potential hazards, and prevention measures.

1. **Hand Placement**: Hold the snare pole securely with both hands. Your dominant hand should be closer to the end where the snare loop is situated, for better control. The other hand should grasp the pole closer to the middle for added support. Keep a firm grip on the pole, and wear gloves for hand protection.

2. **Positioning Relative to the Alligator**: Approach the alligator from behind, staying as low as possible to avoid startling it. Keep a safe distance of at least 5 to 6 feet away from the alligator. Gently place the open snare loop around the alligator's neck with the help of the pole.

3. **Safe Practices for Disengagement After Capture**: Once the alligator is securely snared around its neck, tighten the snare loop gently but firmly to secure the alligator's head. With the loop secure, lift the alligator's front portion slightly off the ground. Then, cautiously approach the alligator from behind and use a pair of tongs to grasp its tail. This will immobilize the alligator and allow you to safely transport it to a relocation or processing site.

4. **Potential Hazards**:
- Underestimating the alligator's strength and speed, which can result in injury if it breaks free or strikes at you.
- Falling or slipping in the water or on slippery surfaces while approaching the alligator.
- Snare loop getting caught on other objects or snapping back at you.

5. **Preventative Measures**: 
- Practice proper handling techniques before engaging in actual alligator hunting.
- Wear appropriate protective clothing, such as gloves, boots, and eye protection when handling the snare and alligator.
- Exercise caution when positioning the snare loop around the alligator's neck, ensuring it is placed securely before tightening.
- Frequently inspect your equipment for wear and tear, and replace any damaged components promptly.
  
Remember that participating in alligator hunting expeditions requires necessary permits, knowledge, and experience in handling these potentially dangerous animals. Always adhere to local laws and regulations and practice safe and ethical hunting techniques.
