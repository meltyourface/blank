In order to address the knowledge challenge, we must first understand the symbolic significance of the alligator in mythology and esoteric traditions. Then, we will examine the practical methods of alligator hunting. Finally, we will explore the intersection between the symbolic aspect and the practical hunting methods, which allows an adept hunter to elevate the mundane pursuit into a profound spiritual experience.

The Symbolic Significance of the Alligator in Mythology and Esoteric Traditions:
The alligator has been a powerful symbol throughout various cultures and carries a rich tapestry of meanings in mythology and esoteric traditions. In ancient Egyptian mythology, the alligator is often associated with Sobek, the god of creation, fertility, and the Nile. Sobek is depicted as either a humanoid with an alligator head or as a fully formed alligator. In this capacity, the alligator is a symbol of primal creative forces, power, and protection.

In some Native American cultures, the alligator is regarded as a symbol of patience, stealth, and survival. They view the alligator as a teacher, granting the wisdom of conservation of energy, the ability to observe life without being directly involved, and learning when to strike with focus and precision.

In alchemy and Hermeticism, the alligator represents the nigredo, or the blackening phase, of the alchemical process. This is the stage of transformation when the base matter is being broken down and decomposed to extract the essence, which will then be purified and bound to the spirit. This process necessitates dissolution, introspection, and an encounter with the darker aspects of oneself.

Practical Methods of Alligator Hunting:
Alligator hunting requires a wide array of knowledge and skills, from identifying prime hunting grounds to proficiently using proper equipment and understanding the habits and behaviors of these formidable reptiles. **Here are some key aspects of alligator hunting methodology**:

1. Preparations, Licenses, and Regulations: Alligator hunters must adhere to the laws and regulations concerning the hunting of this species, which usually includes obtaining proper permits and licenses and following the designated hunting seasons.

2. **Locating Alligators**: An adept hunter knows how to locate alligators by studying their habitats, especially the swamp and marsh areas where these creatures dwell. They are known to sunbathe on the banks during the day and hunt at dusk or nighttime.

3. **Trapping and Baiting**: Hunters may use various types of traps or baiting techniques, such as slowly reeling in baited lines or setting up a floating bait system in which an enticing scent is generated to draw in the alligators. 

4. **Approaching and Taking the Shot**: Stealth and patience become critical during this stage. Armed with the right equipment, such as a high-powered rifle or a harpoon, the hunter must wait for the opportune moment to strike, taking caution not to become the hunted.

The Intersection between Symbolism and Practical Hunting Methods:
The aspect where the symbolic significance of the alligator intersects with practical hunting methods is in the process of transformation and self-mastery. Alligator hunting can be seen as a metaphorical journey into the depths of one's own psyche and an encounter with one's primal instincts, fears, and untapped potential. 

Through their journey into the swamp, the adept hunter learns the virtues of patience, stealth, observation, and precision, much like the teachings of the alligator in Native American cultures. By engaging with the alligator, both as a symbol of primal power and an actual formidable opponent, one can confront and integrate aspects of their dark side, similar to the nigredo phase in alchemy.

Summary:
In conclusion, the intersection of the symbolic significance of the alligator in mythology and esoteric traditions with the practical methods of alligator hunting resides in the transformation of the self. The process of alligator hunting offers an opportunity for the hunter to confront their primal instincts, fears, and latent potential, which can lead to self-growth and a profound spiritual experience. Engaging with the alligator in a purposeful manner, one can materialize life lessons echoed in the symbolic significance of the alligator across various cultures, allowing for mastery and deeper understanding of one's own self.
