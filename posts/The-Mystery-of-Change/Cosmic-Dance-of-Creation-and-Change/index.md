Utilize the full spectrum of poetic devices, from vivid imagery to intricate metaphors, to create a multi-layered tapestry that reflects the inherent complexity of the ever-changing universe.

In transient twilight of the cosmic ballet,
Shiva's dance weaves threads of change, unwoven yet,
Eternal waltz with time, in pregnant eons met,
The ceaseless ebb and flow, crescendo of a cosmic duet.

Through the hourglass of infinity, sands of Ages slipped,
From the firmament's treasure, ethereal stardust sipped,
Celestial bodies shift and swirl, a cosmic symphony,
The enigmatic refrain echoes: all was, is, and forever will be.

From atoms' silent whispers to celestial bodies' cry,
The universe conducts the symphony of the ever-changing sky,
Like marbled tendrils intertwined, the silken strands conflate,
Birthed in breaking dawn's embrace, at twilight meet their fate.

Chalice of the heavens, quenched with darkness dipped in dawn,
Galaxies entwined to etch the melancholic song,
A rhapsody of chaos and order weaved upon the timeless loom,
A masterwork of alchemy, where death begets a tender bloom.

Behold the fleeting tapestry, the impermanence of aeon's chyme,
Ephemeral beauty adorned on temporal vines,
Ever-changing hymn of life, sweet symphony of all there is,
An opus of the universe, a dance of transience and abyss.
