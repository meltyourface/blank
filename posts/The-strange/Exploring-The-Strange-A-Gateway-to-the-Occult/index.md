Practical exercises, rituals, and meditation techniques will be provided for an interactive and comprehensive learning experience.

### II. Significance of The Strange in Occult Studies

The Strange serves as a cornerstone in the world of esotericism and the occult, as it emphasizes the necessity to venture beyond the empirical, analytical, and rational approach to knowledge. Occult practitioners often encounter The Strange as they delve into the mysteries of the universe, breaking barriers between the seen and unseen worlds.

The significance of The Strange in occult studies stems from the following key elements:

2. The Elizabethan Magus, John Dee: Dee, an advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, was known for his attempts to communicate with angelic beings using magic, cryptography, and an enigmatic language called Enochian. Dee's work reflected the crossing of a mysterious realm beyond human comprehension.
