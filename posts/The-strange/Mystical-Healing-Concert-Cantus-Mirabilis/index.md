excerpt: Compose a mystically-infused song harnessing the power of occult solfeggio frequencies, specifically targeting the 396 Hz, 417 Hz, and 528 Hz vibrations, to evoke profound metaphysical healing and spiritual rejuvenation in the listener. Arrange the composition using ancient musical instruments, like lyres and Tibetan singing bowls, and incorporate ethereal chants in Latin or Enochian for enhanced arcane potency. Develop a multisensory experience by synchronizing the music with a visual performance showcasing enigmatic symbols and sacred geometry to profoundly connect with the realm of The Strange.

Olah an pelef zen amb, crana larson invae,
Palma gon prege zar chis, daziz ceph dole,
Ozien od dralsh kia, donas zarpa talho,
Orgozio fiknah ze tod, vorschl bagle iad.
