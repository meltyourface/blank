## Title: The Rite of Auctoritas Invicta

**Purpose**: This ceremonial rite, called the Rite of Auctoritas Invicta, serves to summon the ancient energies of power and authority within the practitioner, drawing upon the wisdom of esoteric, occult, and other mystical traditions.

Preparation:

1. Choose a location with strong ties to the natural world, such as a remote forest, a cave, or the banks of a river. This connects the ritual to the sacred energies found in nature.

2. **Gather the necessary ritual components**: a ceremonial dagger, a chalice filled with fresh water, a censer with burning incense, a lantern or candelabra with three lit candles, and a consecrated pentacle. These items represent the five traditional elements – air, water, fire, earth, and spirit – and their corresponding tools.

3. Consult an astrological calendar to determine the most auspicious time for your ritual. The best time to perform the Rite of Auctoritas Invicta is during the waxing crescent phase of the moon when the sun and moon both occupy the sign of Leo. This astrological configuration invokes the energy of power and leadership.

The Ritual:

1. Begin by casting a sacred circle, walking counterclockwise around the chosen ritual space and drawing a circle of energy with your ceremonial dagger. Visualize the energy as a bright, protective barrier surrounding the area. Invoke the four elemental guardians to guard and witness the ritual.

2. **Place the ritual components at the four cardinal points of the circle in the order mentioned above**: air to the east, water to the west, fire to the south, and earth to the north. Place the pentacle at the center of the circle, representing spirit.

3. Light the incense and pass each ritual component through the smoke, beginning with the dagger and ending with the pentacle. This action serves to purify and consecrate the items for the ritual.

4. **Recite the Invocation of Auctoritas Invicta**:

"Potentia vetus, forcibus arcanis,
In nomen solis, lunae, et stellarum,
Spiritus auctoritatis, ego te invoco.

Elementa quinque, testes in caelo,
Aquantis, ignis, aether, terra, letum,
Ad me venite, auctoritas mihi date.

Lux solis, leonis corde potestas,
Pacisci terras, subiectis dominare,
Creatum imperium, aeternum et invictum."

Translation:

"Ancient power, forces arcane,
In the names of sun, moon, and stars,
Spirit of authority, I summon thee.

Five elements, witnesses in the heavens,
Water, fire, air, earth, life and death,
Come to me, grant me authority.

Light of the sun, in the heart of Leo,
To command the earth, to rule the subjects,
Create an empire, eternal and unconquered."

5. Meditate on the energies invoked, feeling the presence of authority and dominion fill your entire being. When the process feels complete, silently thank the elemental guardians and the energies that have been summoned.

6. Close the circle by walking clockwise around the space, releasing the energy and returning it to the earth. Extinguish the candles, the lantern or the candelabra, and the incense.
