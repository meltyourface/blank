## The Rite of Expulsion

**Objective**: Design a comprehensive banishing ritual for the expulsion of negative energies from a designated space or individual.
**Step 1**: Determining Sources and Manifestations of Negative Energies
To identify the specific sources and manifestations of the unwanted energies, all participants are required to meditate in the space for at least 20 minutes. Through this process, individuals will focus their awareness on any emotions, thoughts, or physical sensations they experience, identifying any patterns of discomfort, anxiety, or negativity.
**Step 2**: Symbolic Focal Point
Upon determining the specific negative energies to be banished, the participants shall jointly create a talisman or sigil that accurately represents the unwanted energies. This can be a hand-drawn image, a physical object, or a written affirmation that is connected to the source of the negativity.
**Step 3**: Integrating Elements, Gestures, and Sounds
To amplify the potency of the ritual, the space shall be cleansed with sacred incense (preferably sage or palo santo), while participants carry out symbolic gestures like sweeping motions or hand movements to clear and remove negative energy. During this process, participants will engage in chanting, drumming, or any other sound that resonates with them and serves to dispel the unwanted energies.
**Step 4**: Purifying and Protective Measures
Before beginning the ritual, all tools and objects used shall be purified by passing them through incense smoke and sprinkling them with water infused with salt. A sacred boundary will be established by marking the space with a protective symbol, such as a circle or pentagram, using salt or chalk. An invocation to guardian entities or spirits shall be performed by each participant, calling upon them to protect and guide the process of banishing.
**Step 5**: Grounding and Centering Technique
All participants will engage in the following grounding and centering technique:

a. Stand firmly with feet shoulder-width apart, close your eyes, and visualize roots extending from the soles of your feet, reaching into the earth, anchoring you to the ground.
b. Take deep, slow breaths, drawing in positive energy with each inhalation and exhaling negativity with each exhalation. Repeat this process several times until a sense of calm and balance is attained.
c. Bring your hands to your heart center, and set the intention to release all negative energy and restore balance within yourself and the designated space.

Perform this technique before, during, and after the ritual to maintain internal balance and fortitude.

Post-Ritual Reflection
Once the banishing ritual is complete, all participants shall gather in a circle to share their experiences, observations, and insights. Each individual will reflect on their emotional state, awareness, and any changes in the energy of the space. The talisman or sigil will then be safely discarded, signifying the release of the negative energies from the space or individuals.

By following these intricate steps, the Rite of Expulsion serves as a powerful banishing ritual to effectively expel negative energy from any designated space or individual.
