## I. Preparation
1. Choose a quiet, dimly lit space where you can comfortably sit or lie down undisturbed. Ensure the space is clean and inviting. You may create an altar with symbols representing Shakti and Shiva, or use candles, crystals, and incense to set the mood.
2. Wear loose, comfortable clothing or nothing at all, according to your preference.
3. Set a clear intention for your practice; this could be to develop a deeper connection to your own divine nature, enhance your sexual energy, or harmonize your inner masculine and feminine energies.

### II. Grounding and Centering
1. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position with your spine straight.
2. Close your eyes and take five deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
3. On each exhale, visualize any tension, stress, or negative energy leaving your body and being absorbed by the earth beneath you.
4. On each inhale, visualize pulling up healing, supportive, and grounding energy from the earth into your body.

### III. Breath Control and Chakra Alignment
1. Begin to practice conscious, rhythmic breathing, with equal inhale and exhale durations.
2. Focus your awareness on your root chakra, at the base of your spine, and visualize a vibrant red light. Inhale deeply, drawing in energy, and exhale, allowing the light to expand and activate this energy center.
3. Continue to move up your chakra system, visualizing the corresponding colors for each center (orange for the sacral, yellow for the solar plexus, green for the heart, blue for the throat, indigo for the third eye, and violet for the crown chakra). With each inhale and exhale, nourish and activate each chakra.
4. Once you have activated all seven chakras, envision a bright white light radiating from above your crown. Draw this light down into your body, connecting and harmonizing your energetic system.

### IV. Invocation of Deities
1. With your energy centers activated, call upon the divine presence of Shakti, the primordial feminine energy. Welcome her presence into your body, mind, and heart, allowing her essence to merge with your own.
2. Next, invoke the divine presence of Shiva, the eternal masculine energy. Feel his powerful and stabilizing essence enter your being, merging with your own and harmonizing with the energy of Shakti already within you.
3. Visualize the divine union of Shakti and Shiva within your body, as they come together to create a perfect balance of feminine and masculine energies, nurturing and strengthening your spiritual practice.

### V. Merging Sacred Sexual Energies
1. Focus your awareness on the union of Shakti and Shiva, envisioning their energies intertwining within your body, like two serpents spiraling around one another.
2. As they intertwine, visualize their combined energy rising up, moving through each chakra, cleansing and empowering them with sacred sexual energy.
3. When this energy reaches your crown chakra, envision it transforming into a brilliant white light, showering your entire body and aura.

### VI. Closing the Ritual
1. Take a moment to express gratitude for your experience, giving thanks to Shakti and Shiva, and to yourself for dedicating this time to your practice.
2. Slowly bring your awareness back to your breath, returning to the present moment.
3. When you feel ready, gently open your eyes and re-engage with your environment, carrying the potent harmonized energies of Shakti and Shiva within you throughout your day.

Remember to treat this practice with reverence and respect, and to maintain a strong foundation in breath work, chakra alignment, and intention-setting, for a powerful and transformative experience in tantra visualization.
