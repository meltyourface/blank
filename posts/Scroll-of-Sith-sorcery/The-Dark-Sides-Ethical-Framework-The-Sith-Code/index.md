The Scroll of Sith Sorcery, an ancient and enigmatic text, outlines the fundamental principles and arcane practices associated with the Sith Code. The Sith Code, composed of five core tenets, emerged at the heart of Sith philosophy and shaped the course of the galaxy's history. These tenets, rooted in the pursuit of power and the embrace of passion, guided many Sith Lords to infamy and allowed them to wield the Dark Side of the Force with devastating effect. 

The Five Core Tenets of the Sith Code:

1. ****Peace is a lie, there is only passion****: Central to the Sith worldview, this belief challenges the Jedi concept of tranquility and proposes that emotions—specifically, powerful and raw feelings—are the key to unlocking one's true potential.

2. ****Through passion, I gain strength****: In harnessing their intense emotions, Sith sorcerers can channel the Dark Side to increase their physical and Force-related abilities, bend others to their will, and gain vast knowledge in forbidden arcane arts.

3. ****Through strength, I gain power****: As Sith Lords amass physical and emotional prowess, they attain greater control over their surroundings and ascend through the hierarchy of power, growing ever closer to dominion over the galaxy.

4. ****Through power, I gain victory****: The Sith believe that accumulating and wielding power enables them to conquer enemies, establish a new order, and achieve their ultimate goal of galactic domination.

5. ****Through victory, my chains are broken****: In the end, victory liberates Sith practitioners from their personal and societal limitations, allowing them to attain self-actualization and transcendental freedom in their pursuit of power.

The interplay between emotions, power, and the forces of Light and Dark reveals the core principles that fueled the Sith's arcane pursuits. Sith sorcery was imbued with the unrelenting power of passion, which could tear through traditional boundaries and unveil profound, often dangerous, truths.

Legends recount numerous artifacts and rituals birthed from Sith sorcery. Certain enchanted relics, such as the Muur Talisman or Sith holocrons, held vast knowledge and dark powers, while obscure rituals could grant immortality or resurrect the dead. Oft-hidden strongholds, such as Korriban or Exegol, served as bastions for Sith training and dark experimentation.

Throughout history, gifted Sith Lords—including Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious, and Darth Vader—strove to actualize the teachings of the Sith Code. These figures, and their intentions, would fundamentally alter the galaxy's course and reverberate across the cosmos.

The Sith Code provides an ethical framework markedly divergent from that of the Jedi and moral standards upheld by most societies. Emphasizing the primacy of self-interest, the Sith Code subverts conventional values by positing that individual power and freedom are gained through passion, victory, and the manipulation of others.

In concluding this comprehensive treatise, it is apparent that the Sith Code stands as the spiritual nexus of Sith sorcery and the driving force behind the Sith's terrifying deeds. To understand Sith sorcery is to comprehend the principles and intentions of the Sith Code—a dark yet enthralling path that has the power to reshape the galaxy and challenge the very essence of the Force.
