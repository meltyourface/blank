In eons past, 'fore dread consumed the land,
A seed was sown by hands unseen, unscarred.
Upon a virgin earth, untouched by strife,
There bloomed a city, born of ancient arts.

The City of Refuge, a haven made
For those who sought the hidden truths arcane.
Forged by mystic minds, a fortress stood,
Against the hostile world's unyielding reign.

From far and wide, the weary pilgrims came,
To lay the stones of this eternal home,
Enduring hardships, dangers, and despair
To raise a beacon 'midst the endless gloam.

From mountains tall, and deep primordial vales,
They brought the tales of eldritch beings lost.
Guided by whispers from the aether vast,
These pioneers unraveled secrets veiled.

Among them stood a woman wise and fair,
Lilithia, her name resounding through
The hearts of all who sought to build this haven,
The arcane mysteries she dared pursue.

The elements revered her every word,
For knowledge flowed betwixt her mortal veins,
They bowed before her masterful command,
Their symphony did guide the builders' hands.

And so, the city rose betwixt the stars,
A tapestry of magic spun in time.
Its walls of fire, its spires of earthen might,
Its rivers flowed with air, a dance divine.

The rituals commenced, the land was blessed,
A sacred rite to consecrate the earth.
The astral beings, guardians in grace,
Bestowed their essence, their intrinsic worth.

Upon the altar blood and smoke entwined,
And chanted words rose up to reach the skies,
As spirit-seers invoked celestial hosts,
To sanctify the hallowed ground they prized.

In galleries of silence, deep beneath,
The scholars sought to peer the truth of old,
Their minds, enmeshed in timeless knowledge steeped,
With covetous eyes, devoured scrolls untold.

Thus sang the winds of fate, this bastion,
An emblem of resilience 'gainst the night,
A refuge for all sorcerers, they thrived
Within its walls, and flourished in its light.

Now etched upon the annals of yore,
The chronicles of the prodigious past,
This City of Refuge stands proud, untamed,
A testament to mysteries unsurpassed.

So hark! And heed the tale of this grand city,
Eagle-eyed beardless youths, and sage greybeards,
The story of a refuge wrought from strife,
Of arcane wisdom gleaned through countless years.
