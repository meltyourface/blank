description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Cabalists, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a mystically layered poem, weaving in the intricate symbolism and numerology of Kabbalah, by incorporating the ten Sefirot, the 22 connecting pathways, and three pillars of the Tree of Life. Delve deep into the esoteric concepts of Ein Sof and the Four Worlds while exploring the relationship between the divine and the mundane. Employ the sacred 72 names of God and creatively incorporate Gematria to unveil hidden meanings. Ensure the final composition of your poem vibrates with the arcane wisdom and transcendent themes of Kabbalistic mysticism as it guides the reader through a spiritual journey of transformation and awakening.

In the heart of Ein Sof, where the Infinite breached the veil,
A spark of Divine, through the Four Worlds, in whispers and braille,
Ten Sefirot swayed in cosmic dance, radiant hues on tender boughs,
Their roots entwined in holy trance, adorned in secrets, branching down.

From Keter, origin of Will, primordial Crown 'bove the Tree,
Through Hokhmah, where Wisdom spills, Spring of fountains, set them free,
Binah, Understanding, Mother Divine, the harmonious maker,
Dalet pathway to Hesed, in eternal love, the awakener.

The 22 paths, woven by letters, divine, a mystical symphony,
Connecting Gevurah, disciplined core, tempered force and boundary,
Tiferet shines in azure light, beauty balanced in its core,
Girasol filaments unite, Netzah’s Victory endures in store.

Hod’s Splendor, structured stability, the latticework inscribes,
Yesod’s Foundation, roots of eternity, where Heaven's Truth abides,
Malkhut, the Kingdom manifest, the undulation of material realms,
The Tree, bridging divine and mundane, on its mighty Pillar's helm.

Left Pillar, Severity, cuts through the night, silver blade of mystery,
Right Pillar, Mercy, sun-washed might, radiant in victory,
Pillar of Equilibrium, center of grace, anchored within the Tree,
Three pillars unite as One, divine law, the fellowship of Trinity.

Encompassing the Tree, the sacred names, seventy-two unfold,
Alef, Lamed, Dalet,גיוש, ארי and עור urning bright and bold,
From Shem HaMeforash, the essence born, secrets of the Divine,
As paths converge, through Gematria, hidden meanings aligned.

In this journey of the soul, we wander through celestial spheres,
Transcending boundaries, we become the Aleph, devoid of fear,
The spark of Ein Sof within, igniting hearts afire,
A symphony of kabbalistic wisdom, a chorus lifted higher.

A testament to God's design, this spiritual progression,
Each line entwined with cosmic truth, in mastery and succession,
Hidden within the Kabbalah's folds, transformations taking flight,
A transcendent ode to the Divine, as Ein Sof whispers through the night.
