In sacred groves of emerald hue, where ancient whisperings echo true,
A deity of foresight reigns, the mighty Tago calls our names.
With heart and soul, we seekers tread, in search of wisdom, knowledge bred.

Through oaken halls and shadows cast, our quest to learn the future, past.
To comprehend the cosmic script, 'neath starry skies and moon eclipsed,
Tago's oracular wisdom sought, by druid legions' artful thought.

With runic chants and sacred fire, we conjure mysteries, never tire,
In mystic dance and rhythmic trance, we seek the keys to future's chance.
Beseeching nature, earth to sky, for Tago's gift, we quest on high.

'Round ancient stones and mossy knolls, we perceive the gods' solemn tolls,
We draw on powers ethereal, embracing truth both plane and celestial.
In Tago's name, through prophecy, we dare explore the realm unseen.

Yet wisdom's gift lies veiled in mist, a tangled web of riddles' twist,
As serpents' coils of truths untold, their cryptic secrets we must unfold,
The divine connection, mystical, leaves us awash in visions cryptical.

To delve into this sacred bond, we offer sacrifice, prayers unconned,
Through mistletoe and boughs of yew, the path to prophesied truth we hew,
The shifting sands of what's to come, decoded through an enigmatic thrum.

Tago, the seer of realms beyond, your blessing wanes not, nor absconds
In complex union, wisdom we glean, eternity's echoes, whispers keen.
Upon the tendrils of prophecy, we cling to that which cannot be seen.

This verseful homage, now bestowed, a testimony to Tago glorified,
From groves of green and spirits' night, forever bound by oracular light,
And in our fate we shall confide, that the Celtic wisdom e'er abides.
