1. Planetary, Zodiacal, and Elemental Correspondences

In the Golden Dawn system, Jupiter is the planet of expansion, wealth, and abundance. You should focus on the energy of this planet in the creation of your talisman. The zodiac sign associated with Jupiter is Sagittarius, and the element is Earth, signifying material prosperity. The sephirah on the Tree of Life related to Jupiter is Chesed, the sphere of mercy, abundance, and stability.

2. Preparation Process

First, consecrate the ritual tools you will be using, such as your ritual knife (Athame), chalice, and wand according to the traditional methods of the Golden Dawn. Gather your crafting materials, including gold or brass metal for engraving the symbols, parchment, and consecrated ink mixed with planetary herbs related to Jupiter.

3. Designing the Talisman

Incorporate the Hexagram of Solomon, a powerful symbol associated with Jupiter, on your talisman. Additionally, include the Enochian script and angelic sigils that relate to the planetary sphere of Jupiter, wealth, and abundance. Research the specific names and sigils associated with the angels of Jupiter, such as Tzadkiel and Sachiel. Integrating these symbols will align the talisman with the energetic forces required for wealth attraction.

4. Charging and Consecrating the Talisman

Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) to cleanse the space. Next, perform the Middle Pillar ritual to create a balanced flow of energy within your aura. Once your energetic body is prepared, execute the Greater Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram (GIRH) to invoke Jupiter's beneficial energies. Hold the talisman in your hands, envisioning the planetary forces filling it, and hexagram being activated. Finally, recite a personal consecration prayer to set your intentions.

5. Activation and Ritual Usage

Craft a personalized ritual for activating the talisman. Choose appropriate godforms, such as the Greco-Roman god Zeus/Jupiter, the Egyptian deity Amun, or any other wealth-associated deities from various pantheons. Invoke them into your ritual space using established invocations. Visualize your intentions for prosperity clearly and imagine the talisman glowing with the energy given by the deities. Thank them before closing the ritual.

6. Maintenance and Care

To maintain the potency of your talisman, periodically recharge it by repeating the consecration process. Keep the talisman concealed from the gaze of others to protect its energy and enhance its effectiveness. Store it in a silk or velvet bag, preferably in the color corresponding to Jupiter, such as a rich blue or purple.

7. Integration with Other Practices

Combine the use of your talisman with regular Golden Dawn practices, such as meditation techniques, astral projection, and divination. Focusing on the sephirah Chesed will strengthen the connection between you and the energies of wealth and abundance. Engage in pathworking on Chesed or work with the Tarot, particularly cards like the Wheel of Fortune, which is ruled by Jupiter, to tap into the flow of prosperity. This will amplify the effectiveness of your wealth-attracting talisman and maintain consistent progress toward your desired outcome.
