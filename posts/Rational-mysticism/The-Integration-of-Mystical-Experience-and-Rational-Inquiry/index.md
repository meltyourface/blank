The answer is: A well-rounded understanding of the universe evolves from both mystical experiences and rational analysis, with each informing the other.

**Explanation**:

Rational mysticism is an approach that seeks to integrate mystical experience with logical reasoning and empirical evidence. It maintains that while mystical experiences provide valuable insights into the nature of reality, they also need to be subjected to the critical scrutiny of logical reasoning and empirical evidence to establish a well-rounded understanding of the universe.

The first statement suggests that mystical experiences cannot be analyzed with logic or evidence, which contradicts the core principle of Rational mysticism. Rational mysticism believes that these experiences can and should be subjected to rational scrutiny to yield valuable insights.

The second statement claims that rational investigation is limited to the exclusion of any form of mystical experience. This position doesn't account for the importance that Rational mysticism places on the role of mystical experiences in understanding reality and the human condition.

The third statement, which is the correct answer, best describes the integration of mystical experience, logical reasoning, and empirical evidence. It emphasizes that both mystical experiences and rational analysis are essential to form a holistic understanding of the universe. Rational mysticism holds that the two are complementary and interdependent; mystical experiences inspire critical inquiry, while rational analysis helps us probe the nature of these experiences.

The fourth statement claims that all knowledge is derived exclusively from mystical encounters, disregarding logic and evidence. This perspective contradicts Rational mysticism's emphasis on the critical role of logical reasoning and empirical evidence in the pursuit of knowledge.

In summary, Rational mysticism is about striking a balance between acknowledging the value of mystical experiences and subjecting them to the rigor of logical reasoning and empirical evidence. By integrating these different aspects of human understanding, Rational mysticism aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the universe and our place within it.
