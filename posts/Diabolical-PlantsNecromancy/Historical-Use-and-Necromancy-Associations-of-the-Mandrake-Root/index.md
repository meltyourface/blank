Answer:

To fully appreciate the correlation between the mythical Mandrake root and its necromantic properties, it is crucial to delve into the plant's historical and symbolic associations, examine the harvesting rituals associated with it, and explore how its uses would have influenced the practice of plant-based necromancy in various cultural contexts. 

Historical and Symbolic Associations:

The Mandrake root (Mandragora) is a highly toxic plant species with a long history of medicinal, magical, and ritual use in various cultures, particularly within European and Middle Eastern traditions. The plant's roots often remarkably resemble human figures, which has contributed to its reputation as a powerful talisman in spells, charms, and rituals. The ancient Greeks and Romans held the Mandrake as a sacred plant with powerful supernatural powers, including love potions, fertility, and protection from evil spirits. 

In the context of necromancy – the practice of communicating with and, in some cases, controlling the dead for various purposes – Mandrake root was often believed to have notable properties. These included the ability to amplify the necromancer's spiritual power, facilitate communication with the spirit realm, or even control undead beings. The plant's association with death partly stems from its use as a potent narcotic and sedative, in which excessive doses can cause death.

Required Harvesting Rituals:

Various harvesting rituals have been described to obtain the Mandrake root in a manner that would preserve and harness its supernatural abilities. These rituals often emphasized the dangers and difficulties in gathering the root and portrayed the process as a perilous undertaking. According to folklore, any direct contact with the plant or its roots would result in severe consequences, such as madness or death. 

One of the well-reported rituals involved the use of a dog, where the root could be exposed to the moonlight and then tied to the dog's tail. The dog would then be encouraged to pull the Mandrake root while the harvester covered their ears in order not to hear the root's deadly screams. Further purification and preparation processes could follow, such as infusing the root with certain oils, consecrating it with incantations, or storing it with other powerful relics.

Transforming the Practice of Plant-based Necromancy:

The use of Mandrake root within plant-based necromancy practices led to a considerable transformation of such practices within different cultural contexts. The highly potent nature of the plant, along with its rich historical and symbolic associations, made it a highly valued and sought-after resource among practitioners of necromancy. 

For instance, in European witchcraft and folk magic, the Mandrake root became an indispensable tool for summoning spirits and enhancing the practitioner's powers, allowing for more effective communication and control of the dead. In Middle Eastern traditions, where Mandrake root was often associated with fertility and love potions, the use of the plant in necromantic rituals may have represented an attempt to bridge the realms of life and death, further amplifying the power that could be drawn from the spirits.

As a result, the incorporation of Mandrake root into necromantic practices across diverse cultures elevated its significance within the discipline and led to the plant being included as an essential ingredient in numerous rituals, spells, and potions.

In conclusion, the correlation between the mythical Mandrake root and its necromantic properties can be appreciated by exploring its historical significance and symbolic associations, understanding the required harvesting rituals, and acknowledging its transformative impact on the practice of plant-based necromancy in various cultural contexts. By serving as a powerful conduit for communicating with and controlling the dead, the Mandrake root not only underscores the importance of plants in esoteric practices but also reveals the extent to which the connection between life and death underpins the foundations of necromantic arts.
