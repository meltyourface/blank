excerpt: > 
  Design a ritual to summon a formidable necromantic being by utilizing the sinister properties of diabolical plants, such as Belladonna and Mandrake roots. The ritual should involve the artful arrangement of these plants, chanting of ancient incantations in a forbidden language, and the incorporation of symbolic elements such as an obsidian dagger and a chalice filled with a concoction brewed from the plants. Furthermore, outline the specific steps to perform this ritual, detailing the ideal conditions, including the lunar phase, and identify potential risks and consequences of communing with the entity.

## Title: Ritual of the Nocturnal Shade

Purpose: To summon a formidable necromantic being - The Ebon Sovereign of the Shadowed Thorns - by using diabolical plants, ancient incantations, and powerful artifacts.

Ideal Conditions: This ritual is best performed during the new moon, when darkness is at its peak. Choose a secluded area, preferably surrounded by an abundance of wild, sinister plants and trees to amplify the ritual's power.

Ingredients and Tools:
1. Belladonna plant (Atropa belladonna) - 5 leaves and 3 berries.
2. Mandrake root (Mandragora officinarum) - whole root, freshly harvested.
3. A chalice - made from obsidian or blackened iron, large enough to hold the concoction.
4. An obsidian dagger - engraved with necromantic runes.
5. Concoction - A brew created from Belladonna and Mandrake plants, infused with crushed snake venom and the ashes of a burnt crow's feather.
6. Black candles - 13 in total.
7. Incense - made from dried moss, nightshade, and wormwood.
8. Broken or shattered human bones - arranged in a circle around the ritual area.

Ritual Steps:

1. Prepare the ritual area by clearing a space and outlining a circle with the broken bones, with a circumference wide enough for you to sit and comfortably make body movements.

2. Place 13 black candles evenly around the circle. **Light them in a counter-clockwise direction while reciting the incantation**: "Ombrae crescentis, vos invoco ad fundum tenebrarum."

3. In the center of the circle, arrange five Belladonna leaves in the shape of a pentagram, with the Mandrake root placed in the middle.

4. Pour the concoction into the chalice until it is half full. Add three Belladonna berries and repeat the incantation from step 2.

5. Ignite the incense sticks and place them at each point of the Belladonna pentagram. Close your eyes and inhale deeply, allowing the aroma to permeate your senses.

6. Hold the obsidian dagger in your dominant hand, with the tip hovering above the Mandrake root. **Begin chanting the forbidden language incantation**: "Yth r'luh ph'nglui mnahn' fhtagn nok'n ur'ashnak, shagg sgn'wahl zhro vgha'nish."

7. As the chant reaches its crescendo, plunge the obsidian dagger into the Mandrake root while envisioning the entity you wish to commune with, The Ebon Sovereign of the Shadowed Thorns.

8. Sit in silence, allowing the ritual's energies to coalesce. The Ebon Sovereign should manifest within the ritual space, ready to heed your requests or share its forbidden knowledge.

Risks and Consequences: Channeling this formidable necromantic being comes with inherent dangers. Failure to complete the ritual correctly may incur the wrath of The Ebon Sovereign or invite lesser malicious entities. Exposure to the fumes of the diabolical plants and the concoction's ingredients can cause hallucinations, unconsciousness, or death. Exercise caution when creating and handling these deadly substances.

It is advised to proceed with this ritual only after gaining proficiency in the study of Diabolical PlantsNecromancy, as well as obtaining a clear understanding of the potential risks and consequences involved in communing with such dark entities.
