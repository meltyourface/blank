## Alexandrian Witchcraft - Origins, Founders, Key Beliefs, and Major Rituals

Alexandrian Witchcraft, also referred to as Alexandrian Wicca, is a modern and syncretic occult tradition that traces its roots to British-based witchcraft. It was founded in the 1960s by Alex Sanders and Maxine Sanders, a husband-and-wife team who sought to create a magical practice that would draw from both ancient and contemporary sources. This tradition is named after its founder, Alex Sanders, who claimed descent from a lineage of witches that traced back to ancient Egypt.

1. **Origins and Founders**:

To understand the origins of Alexandrian Witchcraft, it is essential to look into the lives of its founders. Alex Sanders (1926-1988), known as "King of the Witches," was a highly charismatic figure whose mystical experiences began in childhood. Born in Manchester, he studied various occult traditions, mastering disciplines such as astrology, tarot, and the Qabalah. Maxine Sanders (born 1946) met Alex when she was a teenager and rapidly became his partner in both life and magical practice. Together, they established a coven and began crafting the teachings that would become Alexandrian Witchcraft.

2. **Key Beliefs**:

At its core, Alexandrian Witchcraft emphasizes the dual nature of divinity, represented by the God and Goddess. The two deities are believed to be equal but opposite in nature, with the Goddess embodying the moon, fertility, and intuition, while the God represents the sun, strength, and rationality. Adherents believe that by connecting with these divine aspects, they can achieve personal transformation and spiritual growth.

Alexandrian Witchcraft also incorporates various other beliefs and practices from older pagan traditions, such as honoring of the Sabbats and Esbats, forming covens, employing magical tools, and maintaining a Book of Shadows. Ultimately, the focus of Alexandrian Witchcraft is on transformative personal growth and spiritual exploration, achieved through the study and practice of diverse magical disciplines.

3. **Incorporation of Ceremonial Magic**:

An essential aspect of Alexandrian Witchcraft is its fusion of traditional witchcraft with ceremonial magic. Drawing inspiration from both ancient and contemporary sources, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley's Thelema, Alexandrian Witchcraft synthesizes elements from various esoteric systems. For example, practitioners of Alexandrian Witchcraft use ceremonial tools, rituals of high magic, and adopt qabalistic principles for summoning and controlling elemental forces. In this way, Alexandrian Witchcraft represents a bridge between the worlds of pagan witchcraft and ceremonial magic, merging the intuitive and natural aspects of folk magic with the systematic and structured approach of ceremonial magic.

4. **Major Rituals**:

**The major rituals within Alexandrian Witchcraft can be categorized into two groups**: celebratory and magical. Celebratory rituals include the observance of the eight Sabbats – solar festivals that mark the changes in the seasons – and Esbats – lunar ceremonies that honor the Goddess. These rituals are integral to aligning individuals with natural cycles, imbuing their lives with harmony and balance.

Magical rituals in Alexandrian Witchcraft concentrate on the training and development of the practitioner's psychic and mystical abilities. The major magical rites include initiation, elevating the practitioner's spiritual status and increasing their connection to the divine. Other essential magical rituals involve evocation – summoning and interacting with spiritual entities – and invocation – channelling divine energies to manifest personal transformation.

Through extensive understanding and application of these rituals, students of Alexandrian Witchcraft can harness the powers of both traditional witchcraft and ceremonial magic to manifest their will, develop their spiritual abilities, and experience the divine firsthand.
