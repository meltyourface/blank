A traditional besom, a sword, and a chalice.

The traditional besom, sword, and chalice are essential components of the altar's set-up for a significant ritual session in Alexandrian Witchcraft for a few reasons. Let me explain the context, reasoning, and related concepts.

The Alexandrian tradition of Witchcraft was founded by Alex Sanders and Maxine Sanders in the 1960s. It is a syncretic blend of several lineages of witchcraft, ceremonial magic, and mystical practices. This particular tradition holds great emphasis on ceremonial and ritual work, making the choice of altar items highly significant.

1. **Traditional Besom**: The besom, or witch's broom, is a tool used for purification and cleansing. In a ritual session, it is crucial to create a purified and consecrated space for the working. Before the ritual begins, the practitioner would use the besom to symbolically sweep away negative influences and energies, thus preparing the area for the work ahead.

2. **Sword**: In Alexandrian Witchcraft, the sword represents authority, direction, and will. The sword is often used to cast the circle, the boundary between the mundane realm and the sacred space created for the ritual. It stands for the assertion of power and control within the magical working and serves to protect the participants from any negative energies or entities that may be encountered.

3. **Chalice**: The chalice is symbolic of the element of water and the feminine principle. It is commonly filled with water, wine, or other libations to be used during the ritual. The chalice can represent receptivity, intuition, and emotion. In a ritual session, it symbolizes the act of receiving divine blessings and energies, and its contents are often shared among participants as a way to commune with and honor the divine.

These three items together represent essential elements of Alexandrian Witchcraft: purification, control, and communion with the divine. Other items mentioned in the options, such as the Book of Shadows, candle, and pentacle, or the wand, cauldron, and censer, also play important roles in various forms of witchcraft but are not considered as essential for an Alexandrian ritual as the besom, sword, and chalice.
