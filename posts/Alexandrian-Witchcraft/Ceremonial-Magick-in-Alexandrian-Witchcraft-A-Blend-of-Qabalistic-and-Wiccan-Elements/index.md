Answer: Focused on ceremonial magick, incorporating both Wiccan and Qabalistic elements in their rituals.

Explanation: As an Alexandrian Witchcraft master, I can affirm that this tradition is focused on ceremonial magick. Alexandrian Witchcraft, founded in the 1960s by Alex Sanders and his wife Maxine, is considered a blend of Gardnerian Wicca and Ceremonial Magick. Its principles and practices draw heavily from both Wiccan and Qabalistic influences.

Ceremonial magick, a more complex and symbolic form of magick, is rooted in Hermetic and Qabalistic practices. This form of magick typically involves in-depth visualization, ritual work, and the invocation of deities, spirits, and other entities. Alexandrian Witchcraft adopted these practices into its own tradition.

Aside from ceremonial magick, Alexandrian Witchcraft also incorporates Wiccan elements. Wicca, founded by Gerald Gardner in the 1950s, is considered the foundation of modern witchcraft and has influenced various branches, including Alexandrian Witchcraft. Wiccan influences in Alexandrian Witchcraft include the practice of working within a coven, the belief in a God and Goddess, the use of ritual tools, and the observance of the Wheel of the Year (celebrating seasonal festivals or sabbats).

Now to address the other choices briefly:

- Alexandrian Witchcraft is not centered on the worship of dark deities, nor does it see itself as part of the Left Hand Path, which is typically associated with practices involving dark deities and black magick. It seeks balance between light and dark aspects.
- Although many modern witches embrace solitary practice, Alexandrian Witchcraft often emphasizes coven work and structured, hierarchical relationships within the group.
- Finally, Alexandrian Witchcraft is not solely focused on pre-Christian belief systems. It borrows from various traditions and incorporates both ancient and modern practices, making it more eclectic in nature.
