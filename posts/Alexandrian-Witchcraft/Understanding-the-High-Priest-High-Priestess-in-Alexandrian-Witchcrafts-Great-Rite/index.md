The spiritual practice of Alexandrian Witchcraft, a tradition founded by Alex Sanders and his wife Maxine in the 1960s, recognizes the presence of both masculine and feminine energies in its beliefs, customs, and ceremonies. One of the most important aspects of this tradition is the concept of dual polarity, the harmonious intertwining of both masculine (active) and feminine (receptive) forces within nature, as well as within each person. To better understand this relationship, we will focus on the roles of the High Priest and High Priestess during the Great Rite, a key ceremonial ritual in Alexandrian Witchcraft, and discuss the differing perspectives on the symbolic and actual aspects of this ritual, which some practitioners consider to be central to spiritual transformation.

The Great Rite is a ceremonial rite that symbolizes the union of the God and the Goddess, often enacted by a High Priest and a High Priestess during key celebrations in the Wheel of the Year, such as Beltane or Samhain, or as a part of initiation ceremonies. In Alexandrian Witchcraft, the interplay of the masculine and feminine energies is of paramount importance, and the roles played by the High Priest and the High Priestess in the Great Rite directly reflect this balance.

The High Priest represents the masculine energy or the God, embodying the projective, active, and creative force in the Great Rite ceremony. This energy is often symbolized by the athame – a ritual knife – which represents the power to direct and shape one's will and intention in ritual work. The High Priest, as a physical personification of the God, helps in providing a human representation of this divine energy and balances the duality of the ceremony.

On the other hand, the High Priestess represents the feminine energy or the Goddess, embodying receptive, nurturing, and transformative forces in the ritual. In the Great Rite, the feminine energy is symbolized by the chalice – a ceremonial cup – representing the ability to receive, nurture, and ultimately manifest intentions established through the power of the masculine. The High Priestess, as the human embodiment of the Goddess, ensures the presence of the necessary feminine energy that complements and harmonizes with the masculine energy of the High Priest.

In terms of the actual enactment of the Great Rite, there is a divergence of opinions on whether it should be carried out symbolically or literally. Some practioners of Alexandrian Witchcraft opt for a purely symbolic enactment, utilizing the athame and chalice to symbolize the union of the masculine and feminine energies, with the High Priest placing the athame within the chalice and blessing the ritual tools. Others choose to engage in a physical representation of the union of the God and the Goddess through sexual intercourse between the High Priest and High Priestess. This "actual" aspect is believed to be a powerful tool for manifesting energy and can be seen as a means of accelerating spiritual transformation.

To summarize, the complex relationship between masculine and feminine energies in Alexandrian Witchcraft is strongly represented in the Great Rite ceremony, where the High Priest and High Priestess serve as conduits for the manifestation of these divine forces. The ritual itself, whether enacted literally or symbolically, is a powerful reminder of the balanced dual polarity that lies at the heart of this spiritual practice. By understanding the roles of both the High Priest and High Priestess in the Great Rite, initiates, and students can gain deep insights into the importance of maintaining harmony between the divine masculine and feminine energies in their spiritual journey.
