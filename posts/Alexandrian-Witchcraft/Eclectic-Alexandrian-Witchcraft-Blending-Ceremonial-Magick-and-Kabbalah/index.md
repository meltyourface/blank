Answer: Inclusion of Ceremonial Magick and Kabbalistic practices

Explanation: Alexandrian Witchcraft, founded in the 1960s by Alex Sanders and his wife Maxine, is a tradition within modern Pagan Witchcraft which shares many similarities with other related traditions, such as Gardnerian Wicca. However, a fundamental difference that sets Alexandrian Witchcraft apart is its inclusion of Ceremonial Magick and Kabbalistic practices.

While both Alexandrian and Gardnerian Wicca emphasize a balance between male and female energies and incorporate nature worship along with the acknowledgment of the seasonal cycles, there are some significant differences in practices and philosophies. The incorporation and blending of Ceremonial Magick and Kabbalistic practices into Alexandrian Witchcraft represents a more eclectic approach to the tradition compared to its Gardnerian counterpart. 

Ceremonial Magick comprises a wide range of practices, including elaborate rituals, invocation of spirits or deities, and the use of symbols, tools, and rituals to achieve specific goals. The inclusion of Ceremonial Magick in Alexandrian Witchcraft brings with it a depth and complexity that expands the potential for spiritual growth and transformation.

Kabbalistic practices, on the other hand, are rooted in the Jewish mystical tradition and include methods for understanding and connecting with divine energies. These practices involve contemplating and working with the Tree of Life, a diagrammatic representation of the ten divine emanations or sephirot, as well as various paths that connect them. The Kabbalah's focus on understanding the underlying structure of the cosmos and the relationship between the human and divine realms aligns with the goals of Alexandrian Witchcraft, which seeks to transcend the mundane world and achieve spiritual communion with the divine.

Although Alexandrian Witchcraft does use specific tools and symbols, these are not unique to the tradition and can be found in other Wiccan and Witchcraft practices. So while certain tools and symbols may be more prevalent in Alexandrian Witchcraft, their usage alone does not constitute a significant difference from other traditions.

In conclusion, the incorporation of Ceremonial Magick and Kabbalistic practices into Alexandrian Witchcraft distinguishes it from other similar traditions, such as Gardnerian Wicca, which does not explicitly embrace these practices. The inclusion of these esoteric elements adds depth, complexity, and richness to the tradition, offering practitioners a broader range of tools and techniques for personal and spiritual development.
