  Stage 1: Relaxation
  
  Background Sounds: Soft ambient music, water flowing, distant wind chimes
  
  Breathwork Pattern: 4-4-4 (Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds)
  
  1. Find a comfortable seated position with your spine straight and relaxed, either in a chair or on a cushion. Close your eyes and take a moment to connect with your breath.
  2. Begin the 4-4-4 breathwork pattern and envision a serene garden filled with lotus flowers, symbolizing spiritual growth and purity.
  3. As you breathe, imagine yourself surrounded by a golden light, and with each exhale, let go of any tension or distracting thoughts, sinking deeper into a relaxed state.
  
  Stage 2: Purification
  
  Background Sounds: Deep Tibetan singing bowls, continued ambient sounds
  
  Breathwork Pattern: Breath of Fire (Rapid, equal inhales and exhales through the nose)
  
  4. Transition to the Breath of Fire and imagine a divine flame burning at your heart center.
  5. With each breath, visualize this flame purifying your physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies as it spreads throughout, cleansing you completely and raising your vibrations.
  
  Stage 3: Activation
  
  Background Sounds: Chanting of the Aum (ॐ) mantra, continued singing bowls or ambient sounds
  
  Breathwork Pattern: Nadi Shodhana Pranayama (Alternate nostril breathing)
  
  6. Begin Nadi Shodhana Pranayama and focus your attention on your third eye, the space between your eyebrows.
  7. Envision the Eye of Horus and the cosmic serpent, Kundalini, as symbols of heightened awareness and wisdom.
  8. As you inhale, visualize a violet light gathering at your third eye, and on each exhale, imagine this light growing brighter.
  
  Stage 4: Illumination
  
  Background Sounds: Angelic choir or ethereal soundscape, light rhythm of a heartbeat
  
  Breathwork Pattern: Natural, relaxed breaths
  
  9. Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm and maintain your focus on the radiant violet light at your third eye.
  10. Silently recite the mantra "Aum" (ॐ), and visualize yourself connecting to the infinite wisdom of the universe.
  11. Imagine that your third eye is now fully awakened and glowing with divine light, helping you to tap into intuitive guidance, heightened awareness, and spiritual knowledge.
  12. Take as much time as you need in this state of illumination, absorbing the benefits of your meditation practice fully.
  
  When you are ready, slowly bring your awareness back to your surroundings and offer gratitude for the transformative experience. Remember that you can always return to this meditation whenever you need to reconnect with your inner wisdom and strengthen your third eye's activation.
