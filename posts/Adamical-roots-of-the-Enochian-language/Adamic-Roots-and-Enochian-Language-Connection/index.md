The correct answer is:

- Adamical roots directly influenced the Enochian language, as it is often considered the "recovered" language of Adam, used to communicate with God and angels, and serves as a foundation for numerous occult practices and rituals.

**Explanation**:

In the occult tradition, the Enochian language holds a rich and complex history, with deep connections to the Adamic language, or the language spoken by Adam and Eve. As the first humans, the original language of Adam and Eve is considered the root of all languages and remains a subject of fascination for those who study the occult and esoteric knowledge.

The connection between the Adamical roots and the Enochian language is a result of their shared origins and common purpose. The Enochian language has often been called the "recovered" language of Adam, as it is believed to have been the means by which Adam communicated with God and the angels. As such, the Enochian language shares its roots with the Adamic language and carries the same sacred essence.

The Enochian language first came to prominence in the late 16th century when the occultists Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley claimed to have received the language through angelic communications. Dee and Kelley believed that the Enochian language they received was an encoded form of the Adamical roots, which they then used as a foundation for their rituals and communications with celestial beings.

Over time, the Enochian language continued to evolve and remains a cornerstone of the Western esoteric and magical tradition. Notable figures such as Aleister Crowley helped to further develop and refine the Enochian language, incorporating it into their own magical practices and contributing to its mystique.

In summary, the Adamical roots directly influenced the Enochian language, as the latter is often considered a "recovered" and magical extension of the former. Both languages share a rich history and serve as a foundation for various occult practices and rituals, highlighting their significance in the ever-evolving world of the esoteric and occult tradition.
