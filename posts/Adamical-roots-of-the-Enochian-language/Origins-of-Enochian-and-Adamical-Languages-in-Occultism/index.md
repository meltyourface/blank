Answer: The Enochian language is believed to be the original language of the angels, while Adamical roots are considered the linguistic remnants passed down to humanity.

**Explanation**: The Enochian language, sometimes referred to as the Angelic language, is an esoteric language tied to the occult and mystical practices. It gained prominence through the works of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley in the 16th century. Dee and Kelley claimed to have received this language as a direct communication from the angelic realm, with the angels revealing the secrets of creation and divine knowledge.

Adamical roots, on the other hand, refer to an ancient language that is believed to have been spoken by humanity before the biblical Tower of Babel story. Essentially, it is considered the original language spoken by Adam and subsequent generations until the dispersion of languages at the Tower of Babel.

The connection between the Enochian language and Adamical roots lies in the belief that the Enochian language could be the original language of the angels. This ties it directly to the legacy of the pre-Babel language spoken by the first human, Adam. The knowledge embedded within the Adamical language would have come from the Creator himself, passed down through Adam to future generations. However, after the incident occurred at the Tower of Babel, this knowledge became diluted and lost amidst the myriad of new languages that emerged.

Now, the link between these two languages and their relevance in an occult context lies in their connection to divine knowledge and power. Practitioners of the Enochian language claim that its use grants access to the wisdom of celestial beings, potentially allowing them to work with these entities to enrich their understanding of the cosmic order, perform magical rituals, and gain insights into the nature of existence.

Similarly, Adamical roots, also known as the Adamic language or lingua ignota, are viewed by some as encoded remnants of divine wisdom that can be uncovered and integrated into esoteric practices. Thus, both the Enochian language and Adamical roots share a connection rooted in their purported origins in the divine realm and the knowledge that they may provide to those who study them.

In conclusion, the connection between Adamical roots and the Enochian language in an occult context is centered around their origins in the angelic or divine realm, serving as potential gateways to unlocking sacred knowledge and wisdom that can empower individuals and elevate their spiritual growth.
