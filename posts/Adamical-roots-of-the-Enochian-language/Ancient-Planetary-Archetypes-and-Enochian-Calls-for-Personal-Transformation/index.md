To analyze the correlation between the 7 ancient planetary archetypes and the 49 Enochian crying calls in the context of the Adamical roots of the Enochian language, first, we need to understand the foundation of both elements - the planetary archetypes and the Enochian system.

The 7 ancient planetary archetypes correspond to the classical celestial bodies that were known to the ancient world: the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They play a significant role in esoteric symbolism and are often attributed to various gods and the creation of personality traits in humans. Furthermore, these archetypes represent deep psychological structures that affect both individual and collective consciousness.

The Enochian system, on the other hand, is a complex esoteric language, cipher, and set of formulas that is said to have been revealed to the Elizabethan mathematician and occultist, John Dee, and Edward Kelley in the late 16th century. The Enochian system was supposed to offer a direct way to communicate with angels, as well as a method to decipher hidden knowledge. Its roots are believed to be tied to the Adamic language - the primal, true, and divine language that Adam used to name the world and communicate with God.

Now, let's analyze the connection between these two systems. The Enochian system consists of 49 crying calls, which can be used for various purposes ranging from evocation to personal transformation. To find a link between the planetary archetypes and the Enochian language, we must seek correspondences between the two systems.

One way to approach this is to examine the magical rituals, prayers, and formulas that are traditionally associated with each planetary archetype. By studying these texts, we can identify certain patterns that can be used to map the 7 ancient planetary archetypes to the Enochian crying calls. For instance, specific prayers or invocations might contain a similar structure or reoccurring themes that match those found within the Enochian calling texts.

To deduce a pattern that a modern practitioner can utilize for personal transformation, we must extract these patterns and find a new synthesis that harmonizes both systems.

Here's an example of how this might be achieved: 

1. Identify the key qualities of each planetary archetype and study their correspondence in Enochian and Adamic language symbols, such as sigils, colors, or sounds.

2. Divide the 49 Enochian crying calls into 7 groups of 7 calls each. Then, associate each group with a planetary archetype based on the correspondences found in step 1.

3. Create a new set of 7 transformative rituals by combining the traditional planetary invocations with elements of the Enochian crying calls from the groups assigned to each planetary archetype.

4. Develop a clear structure and step-by-step instructions for each ritual that modern practitioners can use as a guide for their personal transformation.

In conclusion, the key themes include understanding the 7 ancient planetary archetypes, exploring the Adamical roots of the Enochian language, and analyzing the 49 Enochian crying calls. A modern practitioner can utilize these insights to create a new synthesis of these systems for personal transformation by studying the correspondences between the archetypes and the Enochian crying calls, creating a new set of transformative rituals that combine elements of the Enochian system and the planetary archetypes, and developing a clear structure and step-by-step guide that helps practitioners along their transformative journey.
