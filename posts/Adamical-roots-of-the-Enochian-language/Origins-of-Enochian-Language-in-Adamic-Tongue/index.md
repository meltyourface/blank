The underlying principles of Enochian language directly originate from the Adamic language spoken by Adam and Eve.

To understand the reasoning behind this answer, it is necessary to delve into the esoteric and occult foundations of the Enochian language and the concept of Adamical roots. The Enochian language, also known as the Angelical language, is a mystical and magical language that was revealed to Dr. John Dee, a 16th-century occultist, and his seer Edward Kelley. Dee believed it to be an angelic language delivered by angels during a series of scrying sessions.

The concept of an Adamic language, also known as the "language of the paradise" - is a primordial language that predates the confusion of tongues caused by the construction of the Tower of Babel, as described in the Bible. This language was believed to be spoken by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and later transmitted to humanity.

The Enochian language is believed to contain elements and principles originating from the Adamic language. This connection suggests that the Enochian language is not purely an angelic language â€“ separate from any human linguistic lineage, nor is it merely a derivative of ancient Hebrew intended solely for magical purposes. The language's construction and development are complex, but its underlying principles are considered to have a direct connection to the Adamic language's roots.

The concept of Adamical roots, as referred to in the last statement, represents common themes, elements, and principles in various sacred languages. Still, it does not imply direct lineage or origin from the Adamic language. This is an essential distinction in understanding the Enochian language's history and background.

To sum up, the Enochian language's deepest esoteric understanding is that its underlying principles directly originate from the Adamic language spoken by Adam and Eve. It reflects the occult belief that the Enochian language incorporates key elements of the primordial language and is not merely a derivative or secondary language.
