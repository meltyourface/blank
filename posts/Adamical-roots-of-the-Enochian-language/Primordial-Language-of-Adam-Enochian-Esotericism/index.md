The most accurate choice is: The original language spoken by Adam, considered the primordial language by Enochian tradition and a key to understanding the spiritual realm.

In Enochian tradition, the Adamical roots of the Enochian language refer to the primordial language spoken by Adam, the first human being in the Abrahamic religious traditions. According to the Enochian belief system, this original language held immense power and insight into the true nature of reality and the spiritual realm.

The Enochian language is named after biblical figure Enoch, who was a patriarch and the great-grandfather of Noah. He is believed to have communicated directly with angels and had access to divine knowledge and prophecy. The Enochian language is considered a critical element in understanding and unlocking the hidden wisdom of the divine.

Enochian scholars and practitioners have dedicated their lives to decoding the powerful language, believing that it holds the secrets of angelic communication, spiritual ascension, and the creation of matter itself. This esoteric knowledge is said to contain the wisdom to transform one's consciousness and attain higher levels of spirituality.

The systematic analysis of Enochian grammar and linguistic comparison to modern Semitic languages, although valuable in their own right for advancing our understanding of this mysterious language, do not necessarily reflect deep insights into the Adamical roots of Enochian. These approaches may help trace the origins and influences of the Enochian language, but they do not delve deeply into the spiritual and esoteric meaning behind the words and the power they are believed to hold.

A true understanding and mastery of the Enochian language would require not only linguistic and historical knowledge but also dedicated spiritual practice and growth. The primordial language spoken by Adam, considered the Adamical roots of the Enochian language, is believed to be the key to unlocking the full potential of human spiritual development and transformation.

In conclusion, while Enochian is a fascinating and complex language with numerous avenues to explore and analyze, the deepest insights come from understanding its spiritual and esoteric origins within the mythical, primordial language spoken by Adam in the Abrahamic religious traditions.
