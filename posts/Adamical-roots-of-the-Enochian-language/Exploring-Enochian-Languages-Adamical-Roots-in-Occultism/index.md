## The Adamical Roots of the Enochian Language

### I. Introduction to the Adamical Roots

The Enochian language plays a crucial role in occult studies and practices, tracing back to the mystic figure of Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah, the guardian of celestial secrets. The Adamical roots of the Enochian language can thus be seen as the ancient, divine origins within the context of occultism and mysticism, believed to have been spoken by Adam himself during his time in the Garden of Eden. In this chapter, we will delve into the history, significance, and practical applications of these Adamical roots, providing examples from pertinent Enochian texts and making connections to other esoteric systems.

### II. Origins and History of the Adamical Roots

The Adamical roots of the Enochian language can be traced back to the foundations of human spirituality, when the first man Adam is said to have communicated directly with his Creator in primeval times. According to esoteric lore, this primordial language encapsulated the true essence of all things, and it is through the understanding and usage of this language that individuals can harness the potent powers lying dormant within.

Enoch, as a primary historical figure considered to possess this knowledge, allegedly recorded the divine revelations he obtained from the angelic hierarchy in the Enochian language. A notable occurrence of the Enochian language among occultists is the work of Dr. John Dee and his psychic seer, Edward Kelley, during the 16th century. During their scrying sessions, they claimed to have communicated with angels, who provided them with tables of Enochian characters, an alphabet, and instructions on how to utilize the language in magical practice.

### III. Significance of the Adamical Roots in Occult Practices

The Adamical roots, as the basis of the Enochian language, hold immense significance in occult practices. By understanding the principles of the Enochian language and tapping into its potentialities, practitioners can harness the celestial energies and unlock the gates to the divine realms. The language serves as a bridge between the mundane and the spiritual, granting those who master it the ability to influence both planes.

The connection to the first man, Adam, imbues the roots with an air of authority and sanctity. The Adamical roots represent purity, direct communication with the divine, and the ultimate source of spiritual power.

### IV. Examples from Enochian Texts and Their Interpretations

One example of the Adamical roots within Enochian texts is the following phrase:

"Olapiore, exarp scir hattah pire."

It can be translated as:

"Descending, the spirits of the air answer my calls."

This phrase exemplifies the deep connection between language and intention in the Enochian system. By using the Enochian language, one can invoke, communicate, and command spiritual entities. This principle mirrors that of other esoteric systems, such as the Kabbalistic use of the Hebrew language, suggesting a shared basis for the power of language within these two systems.

### V. Correlations to Other Esoteric Systems

As previously mentioned, there is a strong resemblance between the Enochian language and the Kabbalistic system of Hebrew. Both are divine languages that allow practitioners to access hidden knowledge and spiritual power. Similarly, both languages trace their roots back to the beginnings of human spirituality, with the Hebrew language being the first iteration of divine language after the fabled Tower of Babel incident.

The Enochian language also shares some aspects with the Hermetic principles, such as the sacred Tetragrammaton, expressing the divine power and the unity of existence. The connection between these different esoteric systems highlights the universal power of language in occult practice, transcending cultural and historical boundaries.

### VI. Benefits for the Occult Student or Practitioner

Understanding and applying the Adamical roots of the Enochian language offers several benefits to the occult student or practitioner:

1. Enhanced spiritual insight: By learning the language, practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of the spiritual realms and the celestial hierarchies that preside over them, allowing for heightened awareness and a broader perspective on existence.
2. Direct communication with the divine: Utilizing the Enochian language can result in forging a direct connection to powerful spiritual entities, facilitating communion and collaboration for greater spiritual mastery.
3. Manifestation power: Language acts as a conduit for intention, and by harnessing the power of the Adamical roots within the Enochian language, the practitioner can more effectively focus on their desires and manifest them into reality.

In conclusion, the Adamical roots of the Enochian language, as the foundation of this divine communication system, possess immense spiritual power and offer a profound legacy for the occult student and practitioner. Through understanding its history, significance, and correlations to other esoteric systems, an individual can unlock the gates to the divine realms and harness the immense potentialities lying dormant within the language.
