Introduction to the Enochian Language and Adamical Roots:

Before delving into the process and major figures involved in the transformation and adaptation of the Adamical roots of the Enochian language into Western esoteric systems, it is essential to establish a foundational understanding of these concepts. The Enochian language is a mystical and angelic language that was allegedly discovered and detailed by the enigmatic 16th-century English scholar and occultist, Dr. John Dee, and his psychic collaborator, Edward Kelley. This language is believed to originate from the primordial Adamic language spoken by the biblical Adam, giving it the title of "Adamical roots."

The integration process can be divided into three primary stages:

1. Discovery and initial integration of Enochian language by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley
2. Revival and dissemination by influential later occultists such as Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Aleister Crowley
3. Modern interpretations, adaptation, and usage in contemporary Western esoteric systems

Stage One: Discovery and Initial Integration by Dee and Kelley

Dr. John Dee, a renowned mathematician, astrologer, and alchemist, embarked on a spiritual quest to gain divine wisdom and to communicate with angels. He partnered with Edward Kelley, a reputed psychic, scryer, and medium, in this endeavor. Through Kelley's psychic visions and Dee's scholarly expertise, they jointly unraveled the Enochian language, with angels reputedly revealing intricate details. Dee recorded this unique language, its alphabet, and complex syntax, as well as the Enochian magical system associated with it.

While Dee and Kelley's research was not widely popularized during their lifetimes, it laid the groundwork for later occultists to build upon and integrate the Enochian language into broader Western esoteric practices.

Stage Two: Revival and Dissemination by Influential Occultists

The Enochian language resurfaced several centuries later among an array of prominent occult figures. Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, a British occultist, and a founding member of the influential Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, played a pivotal role in the resurgence of interest. Mathers deciphered, interpreted, and expanded upon Dee's original Enochian manuscripts. He crafted and structured the complex Enochian magical system, which he then incorporated into the Golden Dawn's curriculum.

Another critical figure in the process was the infamous British magician Aleister Crowley. Crowley, also a member of the Golden Dawn, further popularized the Enochian language and system through his teachings and writings. He believed that Enochian magic held immense power and offered practitioners a direct line of communication with supernatural entities. Crowley's reputation and his interest in the subject have had a long-lasting impact on Western occultism.

Stage Three: Modern Interpretations, Adaptation, and Usage

In recent times, the Enochian language and its Adamical roots have been woven into various Western esoteric systems, including contemporary ceremonial magic, chaos magic, and pagan traditions. Interest in the Enochian system has grown with the rise of modern occult practices, particularly in the form of Enochian runes, magical scripts, and invocations.

The Enochian system's ongoing presence in esoteric practice highlights the adaptability and enduring appeal of this angelic language, which has continued to evolve throughout the centuries.

**Conclusion**:

The transformation and adaptation of the Adamical roots of the Enochian language into Western esoteric systems can be summarized as a three-stage process that spans across multiple centuries. Starting with the discoveries of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley, the Enochian tradition was revived and expanded upon by influential occult researchers and practitioners such as Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Aleister Crowley. Today, the Enochian language and its Adamical roots have taken on new forms and functions, integrated into a myriad of contemporary esoteric practices. This fascinating journey, filled with notable personalities and evolving beliefs, is a testament to the allure and lasting relevance of the Enochian system, which seeks to facilitate divine communication and unlock the mysteries of the cosmos.
