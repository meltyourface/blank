To fully understand the correlation between the Enochian language's ideographic script and the linguistic properties of Adamical roots through the lens of John Dee's angelic communications, and discuss the implications of this correlation for contemporary occult practices, we must delve into the origins and development of Enochian as a constructed language and its relation to Adamical roots, analyze John Dee's role and influence, and consider how these factors have become intertwined in modern occult practices. 

**Origins of Enochian and Adamical Roots**

Enochian is a constructed language that is believed to be the original language spoken by the angels. Developed in the late 16th century by Dr. John Dee, a renowned mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I, who was deeply interested in the study of the esoteric and the occult, Enochian is often referred to as the "language of the angels".  

The term "Adamical roots" refers to the idea of a primordial language spoken by Adam, the first man according to Judeo-Christian theology, and the subsequent generations before the fall of the Tower of Babel. In this context, it is believed that Adamical roots hold the key to unlocking the divine secrets and mysteries of the universe, imbuing the language with unparalleled power and significance.

**John Dee's Angelic Communications**

John Dee's major contribution to the study of Enochian language and its relation with Adamical roots comes from his meticulous record-keeping and devoted efforts to communicate with angels. Partnered with Edward Kelley, a medium and seer, Dee conducted a series of experiments in which Kelley would relay messages from the angels to Dee in the form of Enochian script or text.

Through these communications, it was presumed that the angels revealed to Dee the information regarding the Enochian language, its script, and its connection to the Adamical roots. The angels stated that the Enochian language was not only the original language spoken by angels but also the language spoken by Adam before the fall, hence the strong correlation between Enochian and Adamical roots.

**Correlation between Ideographic Script and Linguistic Properties**

The Enochian language is unique in that it is both an ideographic script as well as a phonetic language. The script comprises 21 letters, with each letter also representing an idea or concept, making it an ideographic script. The linguistic properties of the Enochian language are rooted in its highly organized and systematic pronunciation, grammar, and syntax. 

The correlation between the Enochian language's ideographic script and the linguistic properties of Adamical roots can be primarily observed in the language's inherent power and potential to unveil divine truths. The angels purportedly revealed to Dee that by mastering the Enochian language and understanding its ideographic script, one could gain access to the divine secrets and hidden knowledge present in the Adamical roots, thereby directly communicating with the divine.

**Implications for Contemporary Occult Practices**

Despite the passage of centuries since John Dee's exploration of the Enochian language and its connection to Adamical roots, it continues to be an influential and significant aspect of contemporary occult practices. Modern-day occultists and magicians incorporate Enochian language, ideograms, and rituals to invoke angels, perform magical workings, and enhance their understanding of the divine.

Some practitioners even view the Enochian language not just as a medium for communicating with angels but also as a powerful tool to enhance their own personal development and spiritual progress. By gaining a deeper understanding of the language's ideographic script and its correlation to the Adamical roots, occultists believe they can unlock greater access to hidden knowledge and divine wisdom.

**In Summary**

The Enochian language, devised by John Dee and based on his angelic communications, strongly correlates with the linguistic properties of Adamical roots. The connection between the Enochian language's ideographic script and Adamical roots can be observed in its potential for unveiling divine secrets and wisdom. This correlation has led to the Enochian language becoming an integral part of contemporary occult practices, often utilized by practitioners to unlock the hidden knowledge within the Adamical roots and enhance their spiritual progress.
