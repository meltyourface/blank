description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Being and non-being, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose an intricate verse delineating the philosophical journey of unifying dualistic concepts, specifically within the realms of Being and non-being. Integrate metaphors and symbolism to emphasize the transcendence of opposites, such as darkness and light, life and death, or creation and destruction. Moreover, incorporate thought-provoking paradoxical themes and enigmatic imagery to challenge preconceived notions of polarity, thereby enriching the poem's complexity and depth.

In twilight's crest where shadows merge,
A seeker chants a cosmic dirge.
A tale unfolds of dual ends,
In realms unseen, where Being bends.

In sacred nooks of primal vale,
A paradox does truth unveil;
Between the void and vibrant flame,
The boundless river calls its name.

Darkened night with ebony cloak,
Serenades of silence spoke.
Yet dawn awakes, dressed in divine light,
Transcending bounds, with colors bright.

Amidst the dance of life and death,
The phoenix draws its final breath.
From ashes rise, in sacred trust,
The essence of existence thrust.

Firmament's song, a birth engraved,
And through the path of null, unmade.
Within the gyre both work and rest,
As creation's heart beats in its chest.

A fractal arc, the paradoxicle jest,
In chaos lost, the cosmos fest.
Entwined they dance in eternal embrace,
Between the veil, a unified space.

As whispered words, a secret creed,
Where shadows mend and light concedes,
Unbind the chains, duality contrasted,
In braided realms, a unity mastered.

So dare arise, the indivisible soul,
Transcending borders, the cosmos behold.
Between the realms of Being and non,
A thread of truth does ever dawn.

In this rhapsody of enigma revealed,
The seeker walks through hidden fields,
And as each paradox falls and shatters,
A unity transcendent, ever remains unaltered.
