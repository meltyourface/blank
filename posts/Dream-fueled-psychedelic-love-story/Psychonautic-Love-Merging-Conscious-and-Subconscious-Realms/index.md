To address this knowledge challenge, let's first break it down into its core components. **The prompt deals with three primary aspects**: 

1. Dream-fueled psychedelic love story 
2. Merging of the conscious and subconscious realms 
3. Altered states of perception 

We will first explore these individual components and then will analyze how, when combined, they influence the characters' understanding of love and their unified spiritual growth. 

Dream-fueled psychedelic love story: This genre typically centers around the experiences of characters who find themselves engaged in love affairs that transcend the conventional boundaries of reality, often employing dream-like or trance states to delve into the intricacies of the human mind, emotions, and relationships.

**Merging of the conscious and subconscious realms**: The merging of conscious and subconscious realms refers to the meeting point between the rational, thinking mind and the deeply emotional, instinctual side of the human experience. It is a boundary-blurring process that often allows for creative insights and a fuller exploration of one's own psyche.

**Altered states of perception**: Altered states of perception refer to situations wherein an individual's experience of reality is modified in some way, often through drug use, trance states, or intense psychological experiences. These altered states can open doors to new interpretations and understandings of one's own experiences and emotions.

In a Dream-fueled psychedelic love story, the merging of conscious and subconscious realms, along with altered states of perception, plays a crucial role in shaping the characters' understanding of love and their unified spiritual growth. **This occurs through several interconnected mechanisms**:

1. **Breaking down barriers**: Merged realms and altered states dismantle preconceived notions about love and relationships, which in turn allows the characters to more fully explore the emotional and spiritual depths of their connection. By experiencing their feelings and desires through the lens of an altered state of perception, they gain the ability to express their love in unconventional and powerful ways.

2. **Unveiling hidden emotions**: By delving into their subconscious selves, the characters can uncover long-hidden emotions and fears, bringing them to the surface in order to address them head-on. In this way, the love between the characters can be transformed into a healing force, unshackling their deepest emotional pain and allowing for genuine personal growth.

3. **Inducing connectedness**: The nature of these stories often holds a strong emphasis on unity and interconnectedness, both between the involved characters and the universe as a whole. Through shared psychedelic experiences and the merging of conscious/subconscious realms, the characters are led toward a more profound understanding of their spiritual bond, highlighting the ways in which love can serve as a catalyst for personal evolution and a bridge between seemingly disparate elements of existence.

4. **More profound love**: The immersion into altered states of perception can lead the characters to challenge societal norms and expectations tied to love, forging a more authentic and deeply-rooted connection between them. This authentic bond transcends material or superficial desires and celebrates love as the ultimate divine force that transcends linear time and space.

To summarize, a Dream-fueled psychedelic love story achieves its unique exploration of love and spiritual growth through the merging of conscious and subconscious realms and the experience of altered states of perception. This fusion enables characters to break down barriers, unveil hidden emotions, induce connectedness, and forge a more profound understanding of love. Through this process, the characters involved can experience a profound level of spiritual growth and discover new dimensions of emotional depth in their relationships. Love, in its truest and most encompassing form, is portrayed not just as a fleeting emotion but as a force that guides the soul's journey towards enlightenment.
