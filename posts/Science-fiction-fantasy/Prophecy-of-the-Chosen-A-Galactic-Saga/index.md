excerpt: Compose a prophecy in cryptic verse, steeped in the intricacies of a science fiction fantasy universe, that foretells the fate of a galactic empire and its key players. Ensure the prophecy is laced with symbolism, veiled allusions to celestial phenomena, and hints at otherworldly alignments, all of which contribute to the unfolding of a rich, complex, and multilayered narrative designed to intrigue and challenge the reader.

Upon the Astral Throne of silver mists,
Where stars align, the cosmic song persists.
Thrice six, the constellations shall converge,
And set in motion, destinies that merge.

In the Era of the Sapphire Moons,
A celestial child's cry, birthed amidst dunes.
The Chosen born betwixt binary suns,
Arising prophetic webs fate has spun.

The infant, wrapped in robes of photon beams,
Destined to rule through the fractal seams.
The Galactic Empire's heart, they shall sway,
Bearing weight from darkest matter to lay.

In shadows shall lurk the Serpentine Prow,
Eyes like nebulas, venomous vow.
Betrayer disguised, unveiling their proof,
By collapsing a star, revealing truth.

Armor forged from the remnants of quarks,
The Chosen to face chaos that embarks.
The Ghost Nebula whispers secrets near,
One lost, sacrificed in bloodied frontier.

Seven Guardians arise, from the chrome,
Their allegiance sworn, visage unbeknown.
The echo of cosmic resonance swells,
A tidal force that will rip, bind and quell.

Galactic storms ignite a dreaded chance,
For black holes dance, in twisted, vile trance.
The Emperor of Rifts seeks to unbind,
Revolutions swift as light turns unblinded.

The Genesis Shard, a crystal of might,
To balance the force in eternal night.
Torn asunder, dimensions torn in strife,
Awakening shades swarming, ravenous life.

Within the void, a cradle of time,
A reunification of the sublime.
The Chosen, the Serpentine, interwound,
A temporal resolution must be found.

When solar winds unite, the skies shall shift,
And radiant souls interstellar drift.
In cosmic harmony, an empire reborn,
A symphony echoing, triumphant and adorned.
