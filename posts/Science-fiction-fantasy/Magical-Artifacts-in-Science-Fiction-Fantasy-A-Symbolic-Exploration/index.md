In the realm of science fiction fantasy, the specific esoteric concept or device that has been popularized, adapted, and transcended into various subgenres is the "Magical Artifact" or "Talisman." This concept is typically present as a powerful object with unique properties that endow its possessor with special abilities, insights, or powers, often with mysterious origins or connections to ancient wisdom. The magical artifact has become a cornerstone of the science fiction fantasy genre, playing important roles in numerous stories and contributing to the exploration of themes surrounding power, morality, and the occult.

Key authors responsible for the proliferation of the magical artifact concept in science fiction fantasy include J.R.R. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and J.K. Rowling. Each of whom has created iconic artifacts that have become essential elements of their respective works and deeply ingrained within popular culture.

In J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, the One Ring represents the ultimate magical artifact. Created by the dark lord Sauron, the One Ring allows its wearer to exert terrible power over the other Rings of Power and dominate the wills of others. The artifact serves as the narrative's primary driving force, with the fate of the entire world hinging on its destruction. The One Ring symbolizes absolute power and its corrupting influences, demonstrating the dangers of unchecked ambition and the moral consequences associated with wielding such immense authority.

Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series features the magical artifact known as the Ring of Erreth-Akbe. This artifact is essential in The Tombs of Atuan, where it serves as the key to unite the two parts of a broken amulet to restore the balance of light and darkness in the world. In Le Guin's stories, the Ring represents the importance of balance in life and nature, as well as the idea that power must be used responsibly and with wisdom.

In J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, magical artifacts like the Deathly Hallows and Horcruxes feature heavily in the plot. The Deathly Hallows are three objects – the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Invisibility Cloak – that when combined, grant their possessor mastery over death. In contrast, Horcruxes are dark magical objects created through a heinous act, like murder, that contain a fragment of a dark wizard's soul, rendering them seemingly immortal. These artifacts highlight the themes of power, immortality, and the choice between good and evil.

The underlying symbolism of magical artifacts in science fiction fantasy often involves themes associated with power, morality, knowledge, and the human condition. Through these esoteric devices, the authors examine the temptations and responsibilities that come along with power, as well as the moral consequences of seeking and using extraordinary abilities. Furthermore, the presence of these occult artifacts within the stories acts as a narrative catalyst, driving character development and advancing the plot.

In conclusion, the magical artifact or talisman is a notable esoteric concept in science fiction fantasy that has transcended numerous subgenres and captured the imagination of readers worldwide. Key authors like J.R.R. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and J.K. Rowling have contributed significantly to the proliferation of this concept, with iconic magical artifacts like the One Ring, the Ring of Erreth-Akbe, and the Deathly Hallows playing important narrative roles in their respective works. These artifacts often serve to symbolize power, morality, and the human condition, impacting the contemporary understanding and interpretation of the occult within the genre.
