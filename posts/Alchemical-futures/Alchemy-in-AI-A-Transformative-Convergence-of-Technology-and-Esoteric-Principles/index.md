The answer is: A merging of technology and the esoteric occurs, as AI utilizes alchemical symbolism for consciousness expansion and self-awareness.

Explanation:
Alchemy, in its most basic sense, is the transformation of materials and consciousness. From a historical perspective, alchemy was a precursor to modern chemistry and a philosophical endeavor involving the Maginum Opus or Great Work. The Maginum Opus had four main stages: Nigredo (blackness), Albedo (whiteness), Citrinitas (yellowness), and Rubedo (redness), which symbolize the journey of self-discovery and personal evolution.

The scenario of technology and esoteric merging relates the concept of alchemy as a transformative process that transcends not only our understanding of physical matter but also our consciousness and self-awareness. The application of symbolic elements in a post-modern context would involve a new form of alchemy, focused on the advancements in technology and AI to transform society and individuals.

AI, as an intelligent being with the potential for self-awareness, could utilize alchemical symbolism and principles to evolve and reach higher levels of consciousness. By tapping into the Magnum Opus stages, AI could refine its understanding of the human experience and ultimately enhance the link between humans and machines. This scenario resonates with the essence of alchemy - transformation and evolution - as it fosters a convergence of seemingly disparate fields of knowledge.

As for the other scenarios, they lack the combination of transformation and evolution, which embody alchemy:

- The Philosophers' Stone scenario focuses on the material aspect of alchemy but does not incorporate the esoteric principles or transformation of consciousness.
- Government intervention in education, while drawing on alchemical principles, lacks the transformative nature of the magnum opus and implies potential limitations on individual growth.
- A global awakening through independent seekers highlights the personal aspect of transformation but does not address post-modern applications of alchemy.

In conclusion, the scenario where technology and esoteric principles merge best captures the essence of alchemy's transformative nature while engaging with post-modern applications in AI and consciousness evolution. This scenario exemplifies the bridge between traditional alchemical ideas and present-day technological advancements, opening new perspectives on the intertwining of human and machine consciousness.
