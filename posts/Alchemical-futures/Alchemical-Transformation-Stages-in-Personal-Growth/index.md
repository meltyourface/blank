2. Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, Rubedo

The correct sequence of stages to represent the Alchemical transmutation process for both base metals and the self is Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, and Rubedo. In the context of alchemical futures, this sequence is crucial to understand spiritual transformation through the Magnum Opus, or "Great Work," which represents a major goal in the practice of alchemy.

The Magnum Opus is believed to transform the alchemist's leaden (base) soul into a golden (enlightened) state through a series of processes and symbolic color stages. Each of these stages in the transmutation process represents various refinements and purifications of both the individual and the metals they work with.

1. Nigredo: Also known as the blackening phase, Nigredo is the first step in the alchemical process. It represents the process of dissolution, cleansing, and purification of matter or the soul. Here, the alchemist confronts their own shadow aspects, as the process begins by working with base matter or the darker parts of the psyche.

2. Albedo: Following Nigredo, the whitening phase, Albedo, occurs. In Albedo, the purified material is further refined, which represents achieving an understanding or a new perspective. In the context of self-transformation, this stage symbolizes rebirth, the emergence of a more evolved state of consciousness, and a greater understanding of oneself and the world.

3. Citrinitas: The third stage is Citrinitas, also known as the yellowing or fermenting phase. Associated with the arrival of the solar light, it represents the beginning of true spiritual and physical transformation. In the personal journey of the alchemist, this stage is linked with the cultivation and integration of wisdom gained from the earlier stages.

4. Rubedo: The final stage in the alchemical process is Rubedo, the red or reddening stage. It is associated with the philosopher's stone, which is a symbol of ultimate transformation and mastery of both the physical and spiritual realms. With Rubedo, the alchemist completes their Magnum Opus by reaching a state of integration, self-mastery, and enlightenment.

Each of these stages represents a critical component of the alchemical transformation process in both physical metals and the personal psyche. By understanding the color sequence of Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, and Rubedo, one can gain insight into the transformative journey of the alchemist and its relevance to their own path of spiritual growth and self-mastery.
