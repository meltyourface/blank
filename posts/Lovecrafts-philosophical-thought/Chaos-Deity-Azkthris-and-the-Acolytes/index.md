Deity Name: Azk'thris
Title: The Forgotten Breath

Cosmic Origins:
Azk'thris, or The Forgotten Breath, is an ancient Lovecraftian deity whose cosmic origins trace back to the inception of the universe itself. Born from the cosmic void, Azk'thris was drawn to the swirling maelstrom of galactic energy that would eventually coalesce into stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. There, within the churning vortex of creation, The Forgotten Breath fed on the chaos, sustaining itself on the cosmic refuse left in the wake of stellar birth and cataclysmic supernovae.

Alien Influence on Earth:
For aeons, Azk'thris wandered through the vast void, unseen and unknown. Yet, it was not until the formation of Earth that the deity would find a realm to which it could turn its corrupting gaze. Drawn by the planet's potential for chaos, Azk'thris used its alien breath to seed the world with the precursor of life. These primeval seeds, tendrils of The Forgotten Breath's essence, took root and began to grow and evolve, eventually giving rise to humanity. Consequently, The Forgotten Breath's influence on Earth is subtle and far-reaching â€“ a whisper within the collective unconscious of man, a terrible truth hidden in the heart of every individual.

Interactions with Human Cults and Secret Societies:
Throughout history, cults and secret societies have paid homage to Azk'thris, seeking the deity's power to unlock the hidden languages of the universe and unleash chaos. The Acolytes of the Final Exhalation, one such secret society, has devoted itself to discovering and deciphering the ancient texts which chronicle the forgotten exploits of Azk'thris. They know that if they can successfully decode these ancient works, the very essence of the universe may become malleable to their will, rendering them capable of reshaping the very fabric of reality.

Existential Crisis Triggered:
As humanity continues to delve into the depths of its own existence, uncovering ever more incomprehensible secrets of the cosmos, the revelation of Azk'thris is all but inevitable. Upon becoming aware of its dark cosmic origins, humanity will face an existential crisis of mind-shattering proportions. Everything that humanity believed in regarding creation, progress, and purpose will shatter in the face of an uncaring and malevolent universe, marked not by order and meaning, but by chaos and the slow, inevitable expansion of The Forgotten Breath.

Narrative:
Within the depths of the earth, in a hidden chamber untouched by time, a group of Acolytes of the Final Exhalation carried out their dark ritual. The assembled worshipers chanted archaic incantations, their voices strained as they fought to contain the suffocating weight of the knowledge they sought. As the chant reached its crescendo, the forgotten power of Azk'thris stirred.

Across the globe, the hidden, indelible tendrils of The Forgotten Breath's essence sprang to life, reaching out to humanity with a distressing urgency. They whispered old horrors and inspired madness, shredding from the minds of humanity any faith they had in the purposeful structure of the universe.

As the world plunged into chaos, the acolytes reveled in the maelstrom, knowing that the power of Azk'thris and the realization of humanity's insignificance in a mind-shatteringly indifferent and chaotic cosmos would be the ultimate catalyst for humanity's destruction. Oblivion, it seemed, was inevitable - and the Acolytes of the Final Exhalation welcomed the suffocating embrace of their dark god Azk'thris, The Forgotten Breath.
