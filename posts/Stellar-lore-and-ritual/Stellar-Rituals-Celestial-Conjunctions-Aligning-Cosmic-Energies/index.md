To answer this knowledge challenge, we must first understand the basic principles and methodologies of the key fields mentioned: Stellar rituals, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and Alchemical symbolism. Following this, we will dive into the impact of celestial body conjunctions on Stellar rituals, incorporating the principles of Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and Alchemical symbolism. Finally, we will summarize the key themes and ideas discussed in our answer.

Stellar rituals are practices developed from a belief in the fundamental connection between celestial bodies - such as stars, planets and other space bodies, and human existence. These rituals aim to harness the energies and vibrations of celestial objects to affect personal transformation, collective consciousness, and the course of human events.

Hermeticism is a philosophical and spiritual tradition largely derived from the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, which combine elements of ancient Egyptian and Greek wisdom. The primary tenets of Hermeticism revolve around the understanding and mastery of cosmic forces, the knowledge of occult wisdom, and the mental, spiritual, and material transformation of the practitioner.

Neoplatonism is a philosophical school of thought that draws heavily from the teachings of Plato and his followers. In the context of mysticism and esotericism, Neoplatonism provides a hierarchical structure of reality, with an emphasis on the idea of emanation from the One, or the divine principle, to the lower realms including the stars and planets, and finally to the material world.

Alchemical symbolism is an intricate language of symbols, allegory, and metaphor drawn from the ancient and medieval practice of alchemy. It encodes spiritual and philosophical concepts related to the transformation and transmutation of matter, the elements, and the soul. Alchemical symbolism often integrates celestial elements and symbolism, to reiterate the universal nature of these principles throughout the cosmos.

Now that we have established context, let's address the conjunction of celestial bodies within a specific astrological constellation.

Conjunctions, in astrology, represent moments when celestial bodies are close in proximity or alignment from our perspective on Earth. This closeness can amplify or combine the energies and influences associated with those bodies, generating a significant shift in the energies available during a Stellar ritual. 

In the context of Hermeticism, the conjunction of celestial bodies aligns with the principle of correspondence - "As above, so below." This means that the celestial bodies in conjunction are considered to have a direct impact on the material world, including its inhabitants. Hermetic principles suggest that a skilled practitioner can take advantage of these celestial influences to strengthen the potency of rituals, transformations, and manifestations.

Neoplatonism provides a structural perspective on the interconnectedness of these influences. As the celestial bodies are a part of the hierarchical structure of emanation from the divine principle, their conjunction serves as a momentary intensification of the specific energies originating from the higher realms. Practitioners working within a Neoplatonic framework might utilize this conjunction as a focal point in their rituals to tap into the heightened energies available, and align themselves with the divine source.

Alchemical symbolism often incorporates celestial bodies and their positions as metaphors for the various stages of personal transformation, such as the process of individuation in Jungian psychology. For example, the alchemical phrase "Solve et Coagula" (dissolve and coagulate) can be related to the conjunction of two celestial bodies. The dissolution and coagulation symbolize the blending of energies, creating a new and profound effect on the practitioner's spiritual and psychological journey.

In conclusion, the conjunction of celestial bodies within a specific astrological constellation can significantly impact the practices and interpretations of a Stellar ritual. **This influence is multifaceted, including the alignment of energies, divine connection, and symbolic meaning. By understanding the principles of Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and alchemical symbolism, practitioners can harness these powerful transformative moments to advance their personal growth and spiritual development. The conjunction and its influence are a reminder of the interconnectedness of the cosmos, reflecting the ancient adage**: as above, so below.
