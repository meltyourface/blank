To complete this task, we will create a Grimoire-based magical procedure that blends tarot symbolism and astrological correspondences, known as the "Astro-Tarotic Invocation." This powerful ritual will interweave tarot archetypes with planetary energies to direct spiritual forces effectively. The system will include the creation of specific sigils and incantations, and its applications can be extended to divination, spellwork, and summoning spiritual entities, while adhering to Grimoire tradition principles.

Step 1: Preparation
- Begin by researching an appropriate astrological correspondence for each of the 22 Major Arcana tarot cards. For example, The Magician could be linked to Mercury, while The Empress is connected to Venus.
- Select a ritual space where the spiritual forces will be directed, ideally in a circular arrangement representing the celestial sphere. Cleanse the area of negative energies with sage, incense, or any traditional purifying method.
- Prepare a Grimoire for recording the sigils, incantations, and ritual results. Ensure that it is made of high-quality materials, as it will hold vital information.

Step 2: Sigil and Incantation Development
- For every tarot card and its corresponding planet, create a unique sigil by joining their symbols, creating a monogram of sorts. Meditate on the card, channeling its energies into the sigil.
- Next, create an incantation that combines the planetary energy and tarot archetype. For instance, for The Fool (Uranus): "I call upon the electric power of Uranus, cosmic initiator, to awaken The Fool's unbridled spirit within me, and open new pathways of wisdom and growth."

Step 3: The Ritual
- Sit or stand in the ritual space, surrounded by the sigils and incantations of each tarot card and planet pair. Light candles and instrumental music can be added for atmosphere.
- Begin with a grounding meditation, connecting with the Earth and the Universe.
- Envision a vertical axis passing through your body from the Earth's core to the Zodiac's outer limits. As you do so, focus on aligning yourself with the astrological correspondences you've researched.
- Call upon specific tarot-astrology energies by reciting the incantations and visualizing their corresponding sigils. As the energies are summoned, feel the connection between the planetary forces and tarot archetypes.
- Once the invocation is completed, allow yourself moments to channel the invoked energies and manifest your intention (divination, spellwork, or summoning spiritual entities).

Step 4: Closing the Ritual
- Express gratitude to the tarot-astrology energies invoked and release them with a closing statement, such as "With gratitude, I release the boundless energies of the Universe. My will is done. So mote it be."

Step 5: Evaluating the Efficacy
- Record the experience and any perceived results in your Grimoire. Evaluate the efficacy of the procedure in different contexts and how it can be improved or modified.

By following these steps, the "Astro-Tarotic Invocation" will provide practitioners with a potent ritual, harnessing the strengths of tarot and astrology and enhancing various aspects of their spiritual practice while maintaining Grimoire tradition principles.
