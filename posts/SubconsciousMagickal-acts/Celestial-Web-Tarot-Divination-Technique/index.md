## The SubconsciousMagickal Celestial Web Tarot Technique

Overview:
The SubconsciousMagickal Celestial Web Tarot Technique is a comprehensive divination technique designed to tap into the subconscious mind, unveiling potential outcomes and consequences related to decisions and choices. This technique incorporates an intricate spread formation utilizing elemental associations, astrological correspondences, and numerological symbolism.

The Spread:
1. **Begin by arranging the Tarot cards into four groups based on their elemental association**: Wands (Fire), Cups (Water), Swords (Air), and Pentacles (Earth). Shuffle each of the four groups separately.
2. Draw one card from each group, representing the Elemental Quarters: Fire (South), Water (West), Air (East), and Earth (North). Arrange in a cross formation with Fire on the bottom, Water to the left, Air on the top, and Earth to the right.
3. Shuffle the Major Arcana separately, and draw three cards. Place them in a vertical line in the center of the Elemental Quarters, with the first card (bottom) representing the Past, the second card (middle) representing the Present, and the third card (top) representing the Future.
4. Next, shuffle all 78 Tarot cards together. Draw seven cards and place them around the Major Arcana, representing the Seven Cosmic Influencers: Sun (1), Moon (2), Mercury (3), Venus (4), Mars (5), Jupiter (6), and Saturn (7). Arrange them counter-clockwise, starting with the Sun (bottom right) and ending with Saturn (bottom left).

Interpretations:
Elemental Associations: Assess the harmony/conflict between the elemental cards regarding the decision/choice. Note how they interact with the Major Arcana cards in terms of balance and stability.

Astrological Correspondences: Analyze the cosmic energies of the Seven Cosmic Influencers and observe how these planetary forces influence the situation.

Numerological Symbolism: Add the numbers of the Major Arcana cards indicating the Past, Present, and Future. Reduce them to a single digit, representing the core vibration of the issue at hand.

Combination: Synthesize these factors to provide enhanced clarity and understanding. Examine the relationships between the elements, astrological influences, and numerology to create a holistic and in-depth interpretation.

Guide/Ritual:
1. Begin by grounding and centering yourself. Light incense or candles representing the elements.
2. Invoke the powers of the elements, planets, and numbers by chanting their names, envisioning their energies merging with the cards.
3. Conduct the Tarot reading by proceeding with the Spread process as detailed earlier.
4. After interpreting the cards, meditate on the insights provided. Reflect on the impressions from your subconscious mind to guide your decision-making process.
5. Close the ritual by giving thanks to the elements, planets, and numbers. Record your findings in a journal to track patterns and progress.
6. As you move forward, remain sensitive to synchronicities. Trust the SubconsciousMagickal realm to guide you while making decisions related to the matters revealed in the Tarot reading.

By practicing this SubconsciousMagickal Celestial Web Tarot Technique, the practitioner deepens their connection to the esoteric insights of their subconscious mind, achieving heightened clarity in decision-making and fostering a unique understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.
