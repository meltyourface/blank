  Answer:
  
  To understand the influences and connections of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley's Thelema on Israel Regardie's teachings and philosophy, it is crucial to first establish the major themes and concepts found in each system, as well as the historical context they were developed in.
  
  The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a British magical society founded in the late 19th century by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and William Wynn Westcott. Its primary focus was on the study of Western esotericism, including Hermetic Qabalah, alchemy, astrology, geomancy, Tarot, and other magical practices. The orderâ€™s teachings were structured into a hierarchy of various grades, with each grade focusing on specific subjects and rituals. The Golden Dawn system placed a strong emphasis on personal spiritual development and the transmutation of the individual practitioner into a more divine state, thereby achieving unity with the divine.
  
  On the other hand, Aleister Crowley's Thelema is a religious and philosophical system based on the central idea of "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," which he formulated after receiving what he believed to be a divine revelation in the early 20th century. Crowley's work could be seen as a natural extension and, in some ways, a reaction against the ceremonial magic of the Golden Dawn. Thelema is characterized by its focus on ritual, symbolism, and the exploration of personal will and individual freedom. Crowley's rituals often involved complex symbolism and ceremonial practices, in addition to utilizing altered states of consciousness to achieve spiritual insight.
  
  Israel Regardie was a prominent occultist, writer, and teacher who came into contact with both the Golden Dawn system and Thelema through his relationship with Aleister Crowley. Regardie was both a keen observer and participant in these systems, and as a consequence, his teachings and philosophy were heavily influenced by them. To better analyze these influences, let's break them down into key elements involving ritual, magic, and spiritual development.
  
  Ritual: Both systems impacted Regardie's approach to ritual, yet each in a slightly different way. The Golden Dawn's intricate, ceremonial rituals were designed to teach initiates the symbolism and practical knowledge necessary for spiritual growth and discovering the inner self. In contrast, Crowley's Thelemic rituals aimed to help the individual manifest their will and desires. Regardie synthesized these influences, creating his take on magical rituals that was both practical and geared towards self-discovery and personal transformation.
  
  Magic: Both the Golden Dawn and Thelema emphasized the use of magic as a tool for spiritual growth and empowerment. Regardie's teachings showcase a blend of these approaches, taking the essential elements of Golden Dawn-style ceremonial magic - such as complex rituals, sigils, and invocations - combined with the dynamic, exploratory nature of Thelemic magic. This created a unique magical structure that allowed Regardie to present a system fostering self-discovery, development, and the manifestation of one's will.
  
  Spiritual development: Israel Regardie's teachings were built upon an eclectic fusion of metaphysical disciplines, including the teachings of both the Golden Dawn and Thelema. However, Regardie placed a considerable emphasis on psychological work, such as the integration of conscious and unconscious aspects in the practitioner's personality. This psychological focus made his approach stand out from that of the purely ceremonial or symbolic found in both the Golden Dawn and Thelema. Regardie found a pathway to merge the transcendent goal of the Golden Dawn with the emphasis on personal freedom and individual will of Thelema, coalescing these aspects into a solid foundation for his own teachings on spiritual development.
  
  In summary, Israel Regardie's teachings and philosophy were undoubtedly influenced by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley's Thelema, most notably in the realms of ritual, magic, and spiritual development. Regardie's work is characterized by the synthesis and integration of these systems, as he sought to create practical magical techniques that empowered the individual while also promoting deep self-discovery and transformation. By merging the elements of both systems and incorporating psychological work, Regardie formulated a unique framework that has since become a pillar of Western esoteric thought and practice.
