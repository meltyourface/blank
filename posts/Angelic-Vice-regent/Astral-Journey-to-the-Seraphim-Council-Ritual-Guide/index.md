## I. Preparation

1. Begin by choosing or creating a sacred space where you can perform the ritual. This space should be clean, quiet, and free from any disturbances. Ensure that it is protected with angelic symbols, such as the Seal of Solomon and the Sigil of Archangel Michael.

2. Prior to performing the ritual, cleanse yourself physically and spiritually. Take a bath infused with sea salt and rosemary to purify your body. Also, meditate to settle your mind, focusing on releasing any negative thoughts or energies.

3. Dress in comfortable, loose white clothing, symbolizing purity and divine connection.

4. Surround yourself with crystals associated with the Angelic Vice-regent domain, such as clear quartz, selenite, and celestite. Place them around the perimeter of your sacred space, creating a protective barrier.

### II. Ritual

1. Begin your ritual by lighting white candles and burning angelic incense, such as frankincense or myrrh.

2. Kneel down and perform a grounding exercise. Visualize a beam of white light flowing from your crown chakra down into the earth, connecting you with the planet's energy. Feel this connection strengthen as it anchors you firmly to the ground.

3. Invoke the presence of your angelic guardians by reciting a prayer or invocation. This can be as simple as saying, "Angelic Vice-regent, I call upon you to guide and protect me during my astral journey to the Seraphim council."

4. Begin inducing the trance state by focusing on your breath and employing a rhythmic, repetitive sound. You can hum, chant, or use a metronome set to 102 beats per minute, corresponding to the frequency of angelic energy.

5. As you enter the trance state, visualize a brilliant white staircase leading upwards. Begin ascending the staircase, feeling the vibration emanating from each step as it resonates with your own energy.

6. At the top of the staircase, envision a golden door adorned with angelic symbols. Speak your intention to connect with the Seraphim council clearly and confidently, and visualize the door opening to reveal a brilliant golden light.

### III. Astral Interaction

1. Project your astral body through the golden light, imbued with the protection of your angelic guardians, and venture forth into the astral realm.

2. Trust your intuition to guide you through the vast astral landscape, always maintaining the highest vibration and seeking out the divine council.

3. As you approach the Seraphim council, express your gratitude and respect, humbling yourself in their presence. Engage with them openly, ask for guidance, and listen attentively to their wisdom.

4. After receiving the guidance you seek, express your appreciation, and gently begin to withdraw. Visualize the golden door once more and pass through it, traveling back down the white staircase to your physical body.

### IV. Conclusion

1. Ground yourself again by focusing on the connection between your physical body and the earth's energy. Feel the connection strengthening, and finally returning your astral self firmly to your body.

2. Our ritual now complete, extinguish the candles, clear your sacred space of the protective crystals, and take a moment to reflect on the wisdom you've received.

Remember to keep a journal of your experiences during the ritual to aid in the interpretation of your astral journey. Reviewing the journal will also ensure that you bring any important messages back into your conscious awareness.

By following this meticulously detailed astral travel meditation ritual, you can be confident in your protection, accurate connection with the esteemed Seraphim council, and the efficacy of your Angelic Vice-regent domain.
