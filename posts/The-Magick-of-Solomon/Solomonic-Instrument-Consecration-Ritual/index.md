You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Develop a custom ritual for consecrating magickal tools, specifically within the framework of The Magick of Solomon. Incorporate the use of Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) and the sacred chants from the Key of Solomon. Detail the steps for purifying and consecrating the chosen magickal instruments, such as the athame, wand, pentacle, and chalice, with the integration of planetary and elemental correspondences. Additionally, weave in the invocation of archangels and divine forces. To enhance the complexity of the ritual, create various sigils with sacred geometry for each instrument, as well as compose a unique mantra to be uttered during the consecration process.

Ritual name: Consecration of the Solomonic Instruments

**Objective**: Purify and consecrate the athame, wand, pentacle, and chalice with planetary and elemental correspondences, invoking archangels and divine forces.

**Preparation**:

1. Create sigils for each magickal tool with sacred geometry based on their planetary and elemental correspondences.
   - Athame: Sigil of Mars (element of fire)
   - Wand: Sigil of Mercury (element of air)
   - Pentacle: Sigil of Saturn (element of earth)
   - Chalice: Sigil of Venus (element of water)
2. Prepare a mantra for each tool to be chanted during the consecration process.
   - Athame: "Koinee Soth Ra Megius"
   - Wand: "Erlah Yod Tah Veol"
   - Pentacle: "Teraph Nod Shem Kronos"
   - Chalice: "Anada Val Zephara"

Ritual Steps:

1. Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) to cleanse the space and eliminate any negative energies.
2. **Invoke Divine Forces and Archangels by reciting the sacred chants from the Key of Solomon**:
   - "AGLA, ARARITA, YHVH, TETRAGRAMMATON, OCHIM, KADOSH, EL, ELOHIM GIBOR"
3. Light four candles, representing each of the four elements: one red for fire, one yellow for air, one green for earth, and one blue for water.
4. Place the item to be consecrated, such as the athame, on the altar and trace the corresponding sigil above it with the appropriate tool (such as the wand for receiving).
5. While holding the athame above the burning red candle, recite the following invocation:

"By the powers of Mars, element of fire, and under the protection of the mighty Archangel Samael, I purify and consecrate this athame. Hear my voice, divine spirits, and infuse this tool with your power."

6. Recite the athame's mantra "Koinee Soth Ra Megius" nine times, infusing the athame with the energy of Mars and fire element.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for the remaining Solomonic Instruments (wand, pentacle, and chalice), using their corresponding sigils, candles, mantras, archangels, and elemental forces:
   - Wand: Archangel Raphael & element of air
   - Pentacle: Archangel Cassiel & element of earth
   - Chalice: Archangel Haniel & element of water
8. Once all the tools have been purified and consecrated, close the ritual by performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) once again.

This custom ritual for consecrating magickal tools weaves The Magick of Solomon's Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, sacred chants from the Key of Solomon, planetary and elemental correspondences, invocations of archangels, sigils based on sacred geometry, and unique mantras for a rich, complex, and effective consecration process for magickal instruments.
