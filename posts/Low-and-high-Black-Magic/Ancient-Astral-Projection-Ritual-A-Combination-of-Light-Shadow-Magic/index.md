## I. The Sigil or Sacred Symbol:

Craft a sigil that combines the essence of both Low and High Black Magic. Draw a circle to symbolize the eternal cycle of time, unity, and protection. Inside the circle, incorporate two overlapping triangles – one pointing upwards, representing Light and High Black Magic, and one pointing downwards, embodying Shadow and Low Black Magic. They combine to form a hexagram, signifying the balance between Light and Shadow to be explored in the astral realm.

### II. Selection of Herbs, Crystals, and Occult Materials:

To enhance the psychic abilities and protect the practitioner, choose the following:

1. Herbs: Mugwort (prophetic dreams), Wormwood (spiritual protection), and Damiana (astral projection). Burn them as incense or brew them as a tea to consume before starting the ritual.
2. Crystals: Amethyst (enhances intuition and protects from psychic attacks), Clear Quartz (energy amplification and divine connection), and Black Tourmaline (grounding and protection). Place these crystals around the sigil and hold them during the ritual.
3. Occult Materials: A black and a white candle (representing Light and Shadow). Anoint them with patchouli oil for spiritual protection and sandalwood oil for enhancing psychic abilities.

### III. Ceremonial Postures and Gestures:

Derived from ancient magickal traditions, follow these steps to align the astral body and empower the ritual:

1. Sit in a meditative posture – legs crossed, hands resting on knees, and eyes closed.
2. Take three deep breaths, visualizing energy entering your body, filling you with pure, glowing light.
3. Envision your astral body as a double of your physical body, connected to your physical counterpart by a shimmering silver cord.
4. Touch your thumbs to your index fingers, forming a circle, symbolizing unity and wholeness.
5. Raise your hands above your head in "trident mudra," connecting to divine energies.

### IV. Invocation of Deities, Spirits, or Otherworldly Entities:

In accordance with your preferred tradition or pantheon, invoke the guidance and guardianship of appropriate entities. For example, invoke:

1. Hecate, the Greek goddess of witchcraft and crossroads, to guide you in the realm of astral travel.
2. Anubis, Egyptian god of the afterlife, to protect you from malicious spirits.
3. St. Michael the Archangel, as a protector against negative energies.
4. Familiars, animal spirits, or spirit guides to aid you on your journey.

### V. Mantras or Incantations:

Recite these carefully chosen incantations to generate specific vibrational frequencies for astral projection:

1. "I seek the guidance and protection of the luminous spirits and the mighty guardians. Guide my astral form and protect my path as I transcend into the astral plane."
2. "Astral realms, I enter thee, led by the wisdom of Light and Shadow. With open heart and mind, I accept your mysteries and embrace the knowledge you share within me."
3. "As the veil between worlds thins, I transcend through the celestial gates, traversing the ethereal realms, exploring deeper realities and higher states of consciousness."

Repeat these mantras as you feel guided, their vibrations lifting and carrying you into the astral plane. Once your journey is complete, return to your physical body by calling your name, visualizing the silver cord, and taking three grounding breaths before opening your eyes.
