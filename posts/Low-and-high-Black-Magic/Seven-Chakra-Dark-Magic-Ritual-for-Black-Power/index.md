**Preparation Phase:**

To prepare for this ritual, you must first set the ambience. Choose a location where you will not be disturbed, preferably in a dimly lit area. Ensure the area is cleansed with sage or other purifying incense. Draw a circle with black salt and position seven black candles at the edge, representing the seven chakras. Prepare sigils corresponding to the entities that will be invoked for each chakra on parchment paper, and place an offering of blood or other suitable liquid on a separate alter outside the circle to appease the supernatural beings aiding in this dark meditative process.

**Invocation of Primordial Entities:**

Each chakra corresponds to a primordial entity within the Low and high Black Magic spectrum. Invoke the entities in the following order:

1. Root Chakra: Zophiel, the Watcher of Hidden Sins; symbolized by the coiled serpent, associated with grounding and primal instincts. Frequency: 396 Hz.
2. Sacral Chakra: Tannereis, the Shadow of Passion; symbolized by the double-headed beast, associated with creativity and sensuality. Frequency: 417 Hz.
3. Solar Plexus Chakra: Asmodeus, the Bringer of Torment; symbolized by the iron pentacle, associated with willpower and ambition. Frequency: 528 Hz.
4. Heart Chakra: Hagith, the Dark Empress of Love; symbolized by the entwined thorns, associated with love and compassion. Frequency: 639 Hz.
5. Throat Chakra: Verrine, the Serpent of Cunning; symbolized by the forked tongue, associated with communication and truth. Frequency: 741 Hz.
6. Third Eye Chakra: Surgat, the Key Master of the Occult; symbolized by the all-seeing eye, associated with intuition and psychic abilities. Frequency: 852 Hz.
7. Crown Chakra: Azathoth, the Blind Idiot God; symbolized by the crown of chaos, associated with enlightenment and divine connection. Frequency: 963 Hz.

**The Seven Chakras as Enigmatic Portals:**

Each chakra represents an enigmatic portal connecting the practitioner to their spiritual well-being and the Black Magic realm. Unsealing, invigorating, and attuning these portals enables the flow of powerful energies through the body and enhances the mastery of Low and high Black Magic arts.

1. Root Chakra: The Portal of Nightmares
2. Sacral Chakra: The Portal of Dark Desires
3. Solar Plexus Chakra: The Portal of Infernal Ambition
4. Heart Chakra: The Portal of Forbidden Love
5. Throat Chakra: The Portal of Insidious Whispers
6. Third Eye Chakra: The Portal of Unhallowed Sight
7. Crown Chakra: The Portal of Chaotic Revelation

**Transformative Visualizations and Mantras:**

As you meditate on each chakra, visualize sinister scenarios and recite malicious mantras to build resonance:

1. Root Chakra: Envision roots plunging into the abyss, absorbing the essence of pure darkness. Recite: "In darkness, I am grounded."
2. Sacral Chakra: Imagine an insatiable fire within you, fueled by your darkest passions. Recite: "My desires will be my strength."
3. Solar Plexus Chakra: Picture yourself wielding otherworldly power, commanding malevolent forces. Recite: "I am the master of my own infernal will."
4. Heart Chakra: Visualize a vortex of black love opening within your chest, engulfing all compassion to be twisted and made fierce. Recite: "My love is a force not to be meddled with."
5. Throat Chakra: Imagine the words you speak have the power to pierce the veil and influence the unknown. Recite: "My voice is the vessel of dark truths."
6. Third Eye Chakra: See yourself endowed with the sight of prophets and witches, illuminating the hidden shadows. Recite: "I seek and reveal that which lies behind the curtain."
7. Crown Chakra: Picture your consciousness breaking free, embracing the ultimate cosmic chaos. Recite: "In union with chaos, I am complete."

**Sealing the Chakra Attunement Process:**

To seal the attunement process, recite the following encrypted incantation in the tongue of ancient dark sorcerers:

*In'agvar thurr'noth zar'quiss ruk'nal,
Kmatiz vhest fru'unther plinth'oxal,
Izgloth phg'wanv nigorus bolth'enthrall,
Nazar'akhar queth'ral yunzak oth'al. *

**Debrief and Banishing Rituals:**

After completing the chakra attunement process, it is vital to perform a banishing ritual to maintain control, dispel any lingering remnants, and protect the practitioner from unintended consequences. Extinguish the black candles in reverse order, visualize a protective barrier surrounding your aura, and recite a banishing incantation, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, to restore balance and order within your sacred space.
