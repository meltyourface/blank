To answer this deeply complex and interconnected question, we will first explore the nature of the works mentioned, their esoteric teachings, and related concepts in the occult, Annotated typescripts, Hermetic Qabalah, and Jungian psychology. We will then delve into their interconnectivity and the significance of understanding the occult symbolism used in annotated typescripts to illuminate the mysteries of self-discovery and spiritual ascension.

Aleister Crowley's "The Book of the Law" is a foundational text of Thelema, a religious philosophy that Crowley developed. It was dictated to him by an entity called Aiwass in 1904 and is divided into three chapters, each representing the voice of a different Egyptian deity. The central message of Thelema is the affirmation of the individual's spiritual and personal sovereignty, encapsulated in the famous maxim "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."

Paulo Coelho's "The Alchemist" is a novel that tells the story of Santiago, a shepherd who embarks on a journey to discover his personal legend and fulfill his dreams. Along the way, Santiago learns the importance of following his intuition, recognizing the signs and symbols that the universe presents, and connecting with the universal wisdom inherent in all things. The Alchemist conveys a message of inner transformation, emphasizing that it is essential to listen to one's heart and remain true to one's own path.

Integration of these two texts can lead to a greater understanding of the dynamics of self-discovery through deciphering the occult symbolism hidden in annotated typescripts, which are interpretive writings that offer commentary on sacred or esoteric texts. Annotated typescripts can clarify the deeper meanings and esoteric teachings, revealing hidden wisdom that can unlock and illuminate the mysteries of self-discovery and spiritual ascension.

The Hermetic Qabalah, a Western esoteric tradition which incorporates elements of mysticism, occultism, and astrology, can serve as a rich context for integrating the teachings of both "The Book of the Law" and "The Alchemist." Hermetic Qabalah's central framework is the Tree of Life, a glyph consisting of ten emanations or sephiroth, connected by 22 paths that mirror the archetypal energies of the universe. Each sephiroth and path correspond to specific psychological, spiritual, and divine principles, which can be decoded through an understanding of the various symbols, correspondences, and relationships at play.

Jungian psychology explores the human psyche through archetypes, dreams, and the collective unconscious. This line of study emphasizes the importance of integrating the conscious and unconscious aspects of one's self, individuation, which leads to spiritual ascension. By analyzing the symbolism and archetypes found in occult works like "The Book of Law" and "The Alchemist", one can glean insights into their own psychological journey and spiritual development.

In conclusion, integration of the esoteric teachings from Aleister Crowley's "The Book of the Law" and Paulo Coelho's "The Alchemist" within the frameworks of Hermetic Qabalah and Jungian psychology can yield profound insights into self-discovery and spiritual ascension. This integration can be achieved by deciphering the meanings, teachings, and messages encrypted in their annotated typescripts that illuminate the pathways to this knowledge. It enables initiates to forge connections between their personal experiences, esoteric ideas, and occult symbolism, thereby catalyzing deep understanding and encouraging spiritual growth. Key themes in this process include personal sovereignty, inner transformation, the importance of symbolism, and the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit.
