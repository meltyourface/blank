To address this knowledge challenge, let's first delve into each of these concepts individually: Goetic demonology, the concept of adversaries in Kabbalah, and the psychological understanding of one's "shadow self." Next, we'll identify the obscure connections between them and explore their transformative potential on an individual's consciousness and perspective on enemies.

**Goetic Demonology**

Goetic demonology is a practice stemming from the "Lesser Key of Solomon," a grimoire (book of magic) believed to have been written in the mid-17th century. The book contains a system of summoning and controlling spirits, most notably the 72 demons of Goetia. These entities are often considered dangerous adversaries with a range of supernatural powers. In Goetic demonology, practitioners seek to communicate and command these entities to gain knowledge, influence others, or fulfill other worldly desires. This practice involves ritual, discipline, and self-awareness to safely navigate these interactions.

**Adversaries in Kabbalah**

Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism that seeks to understand the hidden aspects of God, the divine creation, and the purpose of humanity. Within Kabbalah, adversaries are known as the "kelipot" – shells or husks that conceal divine sparks. The kelipot represent forces of negativity, impediments, and obstacles to spiritual growth. Kabbalists believe that facing and overcoming these challenges helps purify the soul and bring a person closer to God.

**Shadow Self**

The "shadow self" is a concept developed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in his exploration of the human psyche. The shadow is the hidden, unconscious aspect of an individual’s personality that comprises both the positive and negative traits that a person denies or refuses to acknowledge. By confronting and integrating the shadow, one can achieve psychological wholeness, self-awareness, and personal growth.

**Interconnections**

Now, let's examine the obscure connections between these concepts:

1. All three highlight the importance of facing adversity or darker aspects of reality. In Goetic demonology, practitioners confront powerful entities; in Kabbalah, adherents wrestle with negative forces; and in Jung's psychology, individuals engage with their shadow selves.

2. Each system advocates both introspection and communication as vital components of personal growth and transformation. In Goetic demonology, individuals must be self-aware and disciplined to control summoned entities. Kabbalists seek self-improvement by engaging with the kelipot. Jung's concept of the shadow self necessitates that individuals look inward and address parts of themselves they may have ignored or rejected.

3. The transformative potential of each concept lies in harnessing the very adversaries one seeks to overcome. In Goetic demonology, power is derived from channeling the abilities of demons. In Kabbalah, spiritual growth arises from overcoming the kelipot. For Jung, psychological wholeness stems from embracing and integrating the shadow self.

**Transformation and Enemies**

When considering how these elements might provoke transformation within an individual's consciousness, it's important to understand that engaging with adversaries – in whatever form they take – can be both enlightening and empowering. Confronting fears or darker aspects of one's personality and reality can lead to increased self-awareness, resilience, and a deeper understanding of oneself and others.

As these transformations occur, an individual’s perception and approach towards enemies may evolve. By recognizing that darkness and adversity can serve as catalysts for growth and self-exploration, one might learn to view enemies not merely as obstacles to be defeated, but as opportunities for reflection and development.

**In Summary**

The connections among Goetic demonology, Kabbalistic adversaries, and Jung's shadow self lie in their focus on engaging with darker or negative aspects of reality to foster personal growth. By embracing the transformative potential of these concepts, individuals can expand their consciousness and develop a richer, more nuanced understanding of enemies in their lives. As a result, they may cultivate resilience, self-awareness, and personal growth in the face of adversity.
