I present to you the funerary rite titled "Traversing the Veil of Obsidian: A Confluence of Necromantic Intelligences." The rite shall unite the invocations and symbols of three ancient death-obsessed cultures: the Egyptians, the Norse, and the Aztecs.

To ensure a balanced and harmonious resonance, the mystical influences of numerology and sacred geometry are intertwined within each aspect of this ritual.

**Egyptian Component: Anubis's Blessing**

1. Prepare the deceased by anointing the body with rich myrrh-infused oils. Adorn the body with a golden sigil of Anubis, the Egyptian god of mummification and the afterlife.

2. Using papyrus and a quill pen, inscribe the Invocation of Passing:

  "O Anubis, Guardian of the Scales,   Guide this soul through the blackest vales.   In your grace, dispel their mortal plight   And shepherd them through the darkest night."

3. Lay the papyrus scroll on the deceased's chest and seal it with the Eye of Horus for protection on their journey.

**Norse Component: Odin's Embrace**

1. Place the body on a prepared pyre, signifying their entrance to Valhalla. Upon the pyre, carve the Norse symbol, Valknut, a symbol of Odin and the unbreakable bond between life and death.

2. Invoke the Viking Edda of Transcendence:

  "Odin All-Father, Lord of Asgard's might,   Redeem this brave one from earthly fight,   We pray they join your hallowed fallen,   By Valkyrie's hands, we hear your callin'."

3. Ignite the pyre, immersing the deceased in flames as a symbol of their transition to the afterlife and connection to the powerful divine energies of the Norse pantheon.

**Aztec Component: Quetzalcoatl's Ascent**

1. Construct a clay effigy of the deceased, embodying their spirit and potential for rebirth in the spiritual realm. Paint the Aztec symbol of Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, on the effigy to signify rebirth and new beginnings.

2. Recite the Aztec Prayer of Ascension:

  "Quetzalcoatl, Serpent adorned in feathery fire,   Lift this spirit from the mortal quagmire.   Through ethereal planes, their journey shall unfold,   A transcendent passage to the spirit world's hold."

3. Place the effigy alongside the pyre, paying reverence to the Aztec belief in the cycle of life and death, and to safeguard the soul's passage to the unearthly realm.

**Harmonious Resonance: Numerology and Sacred Geometry**

1. Ensure that the ritual is performed within a space shaped according to the sacred geometry of the Flower of Lifeâ€”a series of overlapping circles forming a perfectly symmetrical hexagonal pattern. This divine form will amplify the energy and intention of the ritual.

2. Utilize the power of numerology by incorporating the sacred numbers 3, 7, and 9 throughout the rite, signifying completion, divine perfection, and spiritual enlightenment, respectively.

This meticulously designed funerary rite encompasses the potent necromantic Intelligences of three disparate cultures, unified under numerology and sacred geometry. It is through "Traversing the Veil of Obsidian" that the deceased soul shall find serenity and safe passage to the unearthly realm.
