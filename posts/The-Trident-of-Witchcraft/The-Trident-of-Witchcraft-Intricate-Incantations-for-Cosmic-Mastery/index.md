## The Enchanted Verses of the Trident of Witchcraft

Introduction

This anthology of intricate chants and potent mantras is a collection of incantations meticulously crafted for the practice of The Trident of Witchcraft. These invocations, evocations, and protective verses draw upon the lore of the Trident's three aspects â€“ To Fly by Night, To Render Obedience, and The Nine Sisters. Within these pages, one will find the means to harness the influences of astral realms, elemental forces, and deities associated with the tradition. While these incantations promote wisdom, creativity, and balance, they also adhere to the ethical principles of the craft.

Invocation of the Trident

By the power of the Trident,
Threefold and divine,
Align with my purpose,
Embody the signs.

Aspect one, To Fly by Night,
Grant me wings of shadow and light,
Free me from worldly binds,
In the darkness, new wisdom I'll find.

Aspect two, To Render Obedience,
Empower my will, strengthen my presence,
All that I summon, with harmony align,
Bound by my word and the passage of time.

Aspect three, The Nine Sisters wise,
Goddesses of the craft, lend me your guidance,
Through the mysteries and enchantment of old,
Awaken my spirit, a destiny untold.

Evocation of the Astral Realms

Realms of the astral, celestial spheres,
Kingdoms unseen, embodiments ethereal,
By this chant, your powers ignite,
Lead me to secrets concealed by the night.

Realms enshrouded in darkness and mystery,
Open your gates, unfold your history,
Into the void, my essence I send,
Astral projection, my consciousness ascend.

Binding Incantation of the Elements

Four elements, I call thee near,
Fire, Water, Earth, and Air,
In balance harmonize,
By the Trident's virtue, epitomize.

Fire, forge of creation and passion,
Burn through obstacles, pave my path in action,
Water, a chalice for intuition deep,
Grant me fluidity, clarity I shall reap.

Earth, fertile foundation, stable ground,
Endurance and growth in your embrace found,
Air, a gale of inspiration, thoughts aflight,
In the whirlwind of invention, reveal your insight.

Protective Chant of the Nine Sisters

Sisters nine, deities divine,
From earth and cosmos, your powers combine,
With this incantation, protection I call,
Ward off danger, encircle me all.

A shield of vigor, a cloak of might,
Surround me wholly, both day and night,
In your embrace, I am guarded and free,
Under the watchful gaze of the Trident, I'll be.

Conclusion

May these incantations, invocations, and evocations serve practitioners of the Trident of Witchcraft with dedication and reverence. Let the power of this anthology guide you through sacred rituals and complex spellwork, ever promoting creativity, wisdom, and balance in alignment with the ethical principles of the craft.

In the name of the Trident, so mote it be.
