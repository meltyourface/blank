In the darkest reaches of the nether realm,
Beyond the churning Void and blackest mist,
Dwells the dread lord of malignant charm,
His name, a hissing curse: Mor'grathis.

Unearthed from ancient texts, long forsaken,
The tale of terror, written in blood,
By ancient scribes, hopelessly shaken
By Mor'grathis' fell deeds and boundless power.

Chorus:
Mor'grathis, Lord of Shadows, we entreat,
Infernal master, bind us with your will,
In the blackest hour of deepest night,
We succumb to your unyielding grip.

Born in the fires of Stygian night,
Half human, half devil, twisted in form,
Mor'grathis rose, triumphant in his plight,
To seek revenge on light's eternal hold.

The mighty cities of Jor'daneth
Crumbled 'neath his wrath, where none had fathomed,
And titans trembled in their celestial seats,
As the malevolent Mor'grathis sought to usurp the world.

Chorus:
Mor'grathis, Lord of Shadows, we entreat,
Infernal master, bind us with your will,
In the blackest hour of deepest night,
We succumb to your unyielding grip.

Grant us, O Mor'grathis, your unholy gifts,
Clutching life and order in your grasp,
As we offer our allegiance in trembling verse,
Transfixed in horror, love, and darkest awe.

So be our pact, signed in crimson ink,
We surrender all, our souls, to you,
Devil's Chest heir, be thou Mor'grathis,
Our infernal lord, forevermore.

Chorus:
Mor'grathis, Lord of Shadows, we entreat,
Infernal master, bind us with your will,
In the blackest hour of deepest night,
We succumb to your unyielding grip.
