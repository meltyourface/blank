To design a comprehensive and intricate correspondence framework connecting the archetypal imagery of Tarot cards to the celestial mysteries of Astrology, we will first categorize the 78 Tarot cards into their associated astrological counterparts. We will utilize their associations within the Major Arcana, Minor Arcana, and Court cards.

Major Arcana:
The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, each corresponding to a planet, zodiac sign, or element.

1. The Fool - Uranus
2. The Magician - Mercury
3. The High Priestess - Moon
4. The Empress - Venus
5. The Emperor - Aries
6. The Hierophant - Taurus
7. The Lovers - Gemini
8. The Chariot - Cancer
9. Strength - Leo
10. The Hermit - Virgo
11. Wheel of Fortune - Jupiter
12. Justice - Libra
13. The Hanged Man - Neptune
14. Death - Scorpio
15. Temperance - Sagittarius
16. The Devil - Capricorn
17. The Tower - Mars
18. The Star - Aquarius
19. The Moon - Pisces
20. The Sun - Sun
21. Judgement - Pluto
22. The World - Saturn

Minor Arcana:
The Minor Arcana cards comprise 56 cards divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles. Each suit corresponds to an element, and each card within a suit links to a specific zodiac sign and its decan (ten-degree intervals).

Wands - Fire Signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)
Cups - Water Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)
Swords - Air Signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)
Pentacles - Earth Signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)

Court Cards:
The Court cards consist of 16 cards divided into four suits: King, Queen, Knight, and Page. Each Court card correlates with a specific zodiac signâ€™s modality (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) and element (Fire, Earth, Air, or Water).

To establish the comprehensive correspondence system, we will:

1. Analyze the underlying esoteric, mythological, and historical connections between each Tarot card and its associated astrological counterpart, considering the Kabbalah, alchemical, and hermetic traditions. For example, the High Priestess's association with the Moon can be linked to the Kabbalistic sphere of Yesod, depicting higher wisdom and intuition.

2. Identify and weave in the diverse meanings of the Tarot and Astrology symbols, emphasizing nuances that enhance the richness and depth of the correspondence system. In the case of the Death card associated with Scorpio, we can explore the transformational power of letting go, regeneration, and new beginnings symbolized in both systems.

3. Develop an original method that integrates the combined energies and influences of the Tarot and Astrology symbols within a divinatory context, providing a blueprint for readers to gain profound insight into their readings. The method can involve synthesizing the meanings from both systems - a combination approach where the symbolism of a card, its associated astrological counterpart, and its placement within a spread create a multilayered, individualized reading.

For example, if a Tarot spread has the Ten of Cups (Mars in Pisces) in the "future" position and the querent asks about their love life, we can interpret the card as signifying emotional fulfillment, harmony, and the importance of achieving balance between passion (Mars) and compassion (Pisces) in their future relationship.

In conclusion, by integrating the archetypal imagery of Tarot cards with the celestial mysteries of Astrology, we can develop a comprehensive and powerful system through historical connection and symbolic association. This allows for deeper insights and a richer, more meaningful understanding of oneself, leading to profound personal revelations and life-changing revelations.
