To effectively answer this knowledge challenge, let's start by examining the individual roles and attributes of each angel – Metatron, Sandalphon, and Raziel – and then discuss their interconnected roles in the celestial hierarchy, Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and esoteric symbolism. 

Metatron is considered one of the most powerful archangels and is known as the "Chancellor of Heaven" or the "scribe of God." As a scribe, he records divine wisdom and every event that occurs, including the thoughts and actions of human beings. Metatron is most often associated with the Sephira Kether in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, the first emanation of God and the highest point of the tree, representing divine unity and the top of the celestial hierarchy.

Sandalphon, Metatron's twin brother, is the archangel of music and prayer. He plays a crucial role in delivering human prayers to the divine, acting as a bridge between the earthly and heavenly realms. In the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, Sandalphon is associated with the final Sephira, Malkuth, which represents the tangible, physical reality and is the earthly counterpart to Kether. 

Raziel is the "Keeper of Secrets" and the "Angel of Mysteries," who bears knowledge of divine wisdom and arcane information. In Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, Raziel possesses a book, "Sefer Raziel HaMalakh" (The Book of Angel Raziel), containing secret knowledge and wisdom from God. Raziel often symbolizes the intellect and the quest for deeper spiritual understanding. While Raziel is not directly associated with a specific Sephira in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, his association with the intellectual and mystical aspects of existence makes him an ally to those who seek the truth behind reality.

Now that we have an understanding of the roles each angel plays, let's delve into their interconnected roles in the celestial hierarchy, Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and esoteric symbolism. 

In the celestial hierarchy, each of these archangels occupies a central role in all emanations of divine wisdom and insights. Metatron can be thought of as the divine scribe who records wisdom and knowledge, Raziel as the keeper of divine secrets and mysteries, and Sandalphon as the messenger who bridges the gap between humanity and divinity. Together, they facilitate a flow of understanding from the divine realm to humans, ensuring that wisdom is accessible and can be integrated into earthly lives.

Regarding the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, Metatron and Sandalphon both represent essential components of the Sephirot hierarchy. Metatron, associated with Kether, symbolizes the highest point of divine unity and harmony, connecting the divine with human comprehension. On the other hand, Sandalphon, associated with Malkuth, links the divine to earthly reality and human existence. Both archangels are interconnected through the Tree of Life itself, with Metatron at the top, Sandalphon at the bottom, and their energies influencing all the Sephirot in-between. Raziel's role in the tree may be less direct, but his connection to divine wisdom and knowledge places him as an essential counterpart to Metatron and Sandalphon's roles.

Finally, in terms of esoteric symbolism, the shared significance of Metatron, Sandalphon, and Raziel reflects a central theme within mystical and esoteric traditions: the quest for understanding and the pursuit of divine wisdom. ****Each of these archangels represents a different pathway or aspect of this quest****: revelation through divine records (Metatron), personal experience and spiritual ascent (Raziel), and the manifestation of spiritual truth in the physical world (Sandalphon). Their interconnectedness echoes the idea that the pursuit of wisdom isn't limited to just one aspect of existence, but is instead experienced as a complex dance between these various dimensions of divine insight.

To summarize, Metatron, Sandalphon, and Raziel play interconnected roles within the celestial hierarchy, Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and esoteric symbolism. They each contribute to the dissemination of divine wisdom and act as conduits between divine knowledge and human understanding. Metatron serves as a scribe and repository of knowledge, Raziel as the guardian of divine secrets and mysteries, and Sandalphon as a messenger who brings divine revelations to the human world. Together, their connections within the celestial hierarchy, Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and esoteric symbolism create a multifaceted picture of how knowledge and wisdom are transmitted across different dimensions and realms of existence.
