## Angels in the Esoteric and Occult Tradition: Hierarchy, Roles, and Communicating for Spiritual Growth

### I. Introduction

Angels are celestial beings that play a vital role in the esoteric and occult sciences. These beings have existed in various cultures and belief systems throughout history, serving as intermediaries between the divine and the mundane. In this section, we shall provide an in-depth exploration of angels in the esoteric and occult tradition, including their classification and hierarchy, roles, and the process of establishing communication with them for spiritual growth and knowledge acquisition.

### II. Classification and Hierarchy of Angels

Angelic beings are often organized and classified in hierarchical systems that demonstrate their roles, responsibilities, and degrees of power. One such arrangement, known as the angelic hierarchy, ranks angels in a celestial order based on their proximity to the divine. This hierarchy, commonly attributed to Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a Christian theologian, is composed of nine orders, or choirs, which are subdivided into three triads.

A. **The First Triad**: The Counselors
1. **Seraphim**: These are the highest order of angels, tasked with showering love and adoration upon the divine. Seraphim are often depicted with six wings, representing their ceaseless devotion to serving the divine presence.
2. **Cherubim**: Cherubim possess the divine storehouse of wisdom and knowledge. They are conceived as guards of the sacred and eons of divine power.
3. **Thrones**: Thrones are angels that dispense divine justice and maintain cosmic balance. They serve as the chariots of God and symbolize spiritual enlightenment.

B. **The Second Triad**: The Governors
4. **Dominions**: Dominions hold authority over the lesser angelic orders and work to regulate the divine laws. They maintain cosmic harmony by ensuring that their subordinates fulfill their duties.
5. **Virtues**: Virtues are responsible for performing miracles and bestowing blessings upon the earthly realm. These angels assist humanity in fulfilling their spiritual purposes.
6. **Powers**: Powers work as divine protectors, shielding humanity from evil influences and resisting temptation. They also aid in combating negative energies and malevolent entities.

C. **The Third Triad**: The Ministers
7. **Principalities**: Principalities oversee earthly kingdoms, nations, and communities, working towards the common good and divine plan. They help guide political and religious leaders in their duties.
8. **Archangels**: Serving as divine messengers, archangels convey critical information as well as provide guidance and assistance to individuals during crucial moments.
9. **Angels**: The lowest order in the hierarchy, angels are designated to be personal guides and protectors, actively involved in human affairs and assisting people in their spiritual journeys.

### III. Roles of Angels

The primary function of angels in esoteric and occult tradition is to strengthen humanity's connection to the divine and enlighten them with divine wisdom. **Additionally, angels**:
a) Offer guidance, support, and protection in all aspects of life
b) Assist in the process of spiritual growth, healing, and self-discovery
c) Ward off negative energies and malevolent entities
d) Help people harness their inner powers and abilities

### IV. Establishing Communication with Angels

A. Preparation
1. **Purification**: Before attempting to communicate with angels, one must purify the body, mind, and soul through cleansing rituals, such as taking a ritual bath, meditation, or prayer.
2. **Sacred Space**: Creating a serene, tranquil environment is essential for establishing a connection with angels. This may involve setting up an altar, lighting candles, and burning incense to set the atmosphere.
3. **Protective Measures**: Surround oneself with protective symbols or items, such as talismans or crystals, to ward off any negative energies or interference.

B. Invocation and Meditation
1. **Invocation**: Call upon the specific angel(s) with whom you seek communication. This can be achieved through prayer, chanting, or using a written invocation.
2. **Meditation**: Enter a meditative state, focusing on the connection with the desired angelic being. Envision their presence and await their guidance or message.
3. **Gratitude**: Express gratitude towards the angel(s) for their assistance and guidance once the communication is complete. This helps maintain a positive connection with them for future encounters.

### V. Precautions, Benefits, and Risks

A. Precautions
1. Verify the identity of the angelic being before establishing communication, ensuring that it is not an imposter or malevolent entity.
2. Approach communication with respect and humility, recognizing the higher status of angels in the celestial order.
3. Do not attempt to control, manipulate, or demand anything from the angels, as this may have adverse consequences.

B. Benefits
1. Enhanced spiritual growth and self-awareness
2. Access to divine wisdom and guidance
3. Strengthened connection to the divine and elevated spiritual experiences

C. Risks
1. Deception from malevolent entities posing as angels
2. Overdependence on angelic guidance, neglecting personal intuition or judgment
3. Unintentional exposure to negative energies or entities

In conclusion, understanding the hierarchical structures and roles of angels in the esoteric and occult traditions can provide a rich resource for spiritual growth and knowledge acquisition. By responsibly establishing communication with these celestial beings through proper precautions, one can open the door to a more profound connection with the divine and discover the wisdom and guidance of the angelic realm.
