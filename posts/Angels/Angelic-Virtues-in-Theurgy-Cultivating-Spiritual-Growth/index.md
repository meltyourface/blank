In order to answer this question, we will examine the correlation between specific angels and their associated divine virtues, explore the role these virtues play in traditional theurgy and angelology, and discuss how these relationships contribute to the spiritual growth and enlightenment of an aspirant. 

To begin, let us first examine the concept of angels. Angels are celestial beings that serve as intermediaries between the divine and human realms, carrying out specific duties and acting as guardians, messengers, and helpers. Throughout the millennia, various religious and spiritual traditions have developed their own unique perspectives on angelic beings and their roles in the cosmos. In this context, we will focus on the Judeo-Christian angelic hierarchy and its corresponding divine virtues.

The Judeo-Christian angelic hierarchy is commonly divided into nine orders or choirs, as outlined by theologian and philosopher Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in his work "The Celestial Hierarchy." These nine choirs of angels are further organized into three triads, with each triad consisting of three orders. Each order of angels is associated with specific divine virtues, which reflect their connection to God's will and embody their unique qualities and responsibilities.

Let us now look at the angelic hierarchy and the corresponding virtues associated with each order:

1. **First Triad**:
   - Seraphim: Love, ardor, and the continuous contemplation of the divine
   - Cherubim: Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of divine truths
   - Thrones: Divine justice and the maintenance of cosmic order

2. **Second Triad**:
   - Dominions: Leadership, authority, and governance over lower choirs of angels
   - Virtues: Power, miracles, and the control of the natural world
   - Powers: Protection, courage, and the preservation of divine order

3. **Third Triad**:
   - Principalities: Guardianship of nations, communities, and organizations
   - Archangels: Deliverance of important messages, and guidance of specific individuals
   - Angels (lowest choir): Personal guardianship, care, and guidance of individual human beings

Now let us examine how these divine virtues interplay in traditional theurgy and angelology. Theurgy is the practice of invoking and working with divine beings, such as angels, in order to achieve spiritual growth, uncover hidden knowledge, and align oneself with the divine will. Angelology is the study of angels and their qualities, virtues, and roles in the universe. The interplay of these virtues begins with the understanding that each angelic order embodies specific divine virtues and, as such, carries a unique energy frequency and function.

In traditional theurgy, the process of invocation or communion with the angels is integrated into specific spiritual practices, such as meditation, prayer, and ritual. These practices allow the aspirant to attune their consciousness to the divine virtues and energies held by the angels, thus facilitating spiritual growth and enlightenment. For example, by invoking the Seraphim, an aspirant might focus on cultivating divine love, while working with the Cherubim could foster a deeper understanding of divine wisdom and knowledge.

Lastly, let us discuss how these angel-virtue relationships contribute to the cultivation of a spiritual aspirant's self-growth and enlightenment. By studying and invoking the divine virtues of angels, the aspirant strengthens their connection to the divine and raises their own vibrational frequency. This process accelerates spiritual growth by assisting the aspirant in developing virtues and qualities such as wisdom, compassion, humility, and self-discipline, which are essential for progression towards enlightenment.

In conclusion, the relationship between specific angels and their associated divine virtues is an integral aspect of traditional theurgy and angelology. As the aspirant engages with these celestial beings and their divine qualities, they are empowered to cultivate their own spiritual growth and journey towards enlightenment. Some key themes in this process include the study of angelic hierarchies, the development of specific virtues, and the use of spiritual practices such as meditation, prayer, and ritual to attune oneself to the energies of the angelic realms. By aligning their consciousness with these divine virtues, the aspirant forges a deep connection to the divine and ultimately advances on their spiritual path.
