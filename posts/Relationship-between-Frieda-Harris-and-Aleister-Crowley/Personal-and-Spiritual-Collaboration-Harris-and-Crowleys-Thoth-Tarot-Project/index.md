Frieda Harris was a talented artist and a prominent figure in the London art scene, while Aleister Crowley was an influential author, magician, and occultist. Their collaboration on the Thoth Tarot project resulted from a complex interplay of personal, spiritual, and artistic motivations.

1. **Personal Connection**: Frieda Harris first met Aleister Crowley in the late 1930s through a mutual friend. Initially, she was not particularly interested in his controversial beliefs. However, as their relationship developed, Harris became more and more captivated by Crowley's charisma, intellect, and unconventional lifestyle. They forged a strong bond that transcended their professional collaboration, making it easier for Harris to overlook Crowley's controversial status in society.

2. **Spiritual Aspect**: Upon further acquaintance with Crowley, Harris became increasingly drawn to his spiritual and occult beliefs. She found a deep and profound connection to the esoteric teachings of Thelema, Crowley's religion that revolves around finding one's true will. Through their conversations, Harris felt that working with Crowley could not only enhance her artistic skills but also further her spiritual growth.

3. **Artistic Motivations**: Harris saw the Thoth Tarot project as a unique opportunity to explore new artistic horizons. The blending of esoteric symbolism with her own artistic vision provided a challenging and rewarding avenue for her creativity. Additionally, the collaboration with Crowley offered her the chance to leave a lasting mark on the world of Tarot and occultism, providing her work with more longevity than her other artistic endeavors.

4. **Aspirations**: Harris aspired to create a modern and innovative Tarot deck that would capture the essence of Thelema and Crowley's teachings. To accomplish this, she immersed herself in the study of occult symbolism, symbiotic relationships between the major and minor arcana, and the spiritual meaning of the Thoth Tarot deck. It was through this process that she hoped to elevate her own understanding of the occult and the spiritual forces at work in the world.

5. **Overcoming Controversy**: Despite Crowley's controversial status, Harris was able to separate the man from his reputation. She believed that his immense knowledge and experience in the occult could contribute significantly to the project, and that their collaboration could produce a Tarot deck that would be unparalleled in its time. While some people may have shied away from working with Crowley due to his notorious reputation, Harris chose to focus on his teachings and the artistic potential of the Thoth Tarot project.

In conclusion, Frieda Harris's decision to collaborate with Aleister Crowley on the Thoth Tarot project was motivated by a combination of personal and spiritual connections, artistic motivations, aspirations, and her willingness to overcome the controversy surrounding Crowley. The result of their collaboration was the creation of a groundbreaking Tarot deck that continues to inspire and shape the world of Tarot and occultism today.
