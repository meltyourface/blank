Frieda Harris and Aleister Crowley were known to have a close collaborative relationship that went beyond the creation of the Thoth Tarot deck. **Although the Thoth Tarot remains their most famous joint endeavor, they were involved in various other creative ventures together. Here are some lesser-known collaborative projects and creative expressions they engaged in**:

1. "Astrology, Your Place in the Sun" (1940) and "Astrology, Your Place Among the Stars" (1941) - These book collaborations were penned by Crowley, while Harris contributed with illustrations. Harris' involvement in both works demonstrated her deep interest and connection to Crowley's unique interpretation of astrology.

2. "The A.'.A.'. Planetary System" - This was an illustration project that Harris worked on under Crowley's guidance. The A.'.A.'. Planetary System represents the esoteric planetary correspondences and magical significance as taught by Crowley. These illustrations were meant to harmonize their understanding of planetary energies with Kabbalistic, astrological, and esoteric systems.

3. Experimental Photography - Besides tarot and written works, Harris and Crowley explored the emerging field of photography to express their esoteric ideas. They took turns behind the camera, documenting their explorations, rituals, and symbolisms, intending to use these images to translate their understanding of occult practices. Most of these photographs remain unpublished and obscure, hidden within their vast collection of personal effects.

4. Theatrical and Ritual Performances - Harris and Crowley were known to perform and interpret occult rituals together, further cementing their bond and creative partnership. The specific rituals they performed are not well-documented, but they likely explored the rites and ceremonies of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), the Thelemic organization that Crowley led.

Influences and inspirations behind these collaborations can be attributed to the intellectual connection between Harris and Crowley, as well as their shared passion for the occult and artistic expressions. They were both deeply inspired by the practices of Thelema, the spiritual philosophy Crowley founded, which emphasized the pursuit of one's True Will and the maxim "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law".

Furthermore, the historical background of their partnership occurred during a time of immense social change, particularly during World War II. Their work together created a sense of stability and provided a creative outlet for them amidst the chaos of the time. Harris' own belief in the power of symbolism and her fascination with diverse spiritual systems inspired their collaborations and pushed her to embrace her role as "Soror IAO131," a key member of Crowley's magical order.

In conclusion, the relationship between Frieda Harris and Aleister Crowley went beyond the creation of the Thoth Tarot deck, and included collaborations on various other creative ventures and esoteric works. Their shared passion for the occult, artistic expression, and exploration of ideas served as the foundation for their relationship and inspired their lesser-known creative endeavors.
