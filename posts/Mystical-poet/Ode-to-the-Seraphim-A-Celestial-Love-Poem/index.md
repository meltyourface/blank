description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Mystical poet, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a lyrical incantation in the style of mystical poetry, invoking a chosen ethereal being or divine figure. Envelop your verses with vivid imagery, symbolic language, and intricate metaphors, delving into the realm of sacred and esoteric knowledge. Draw inspiration from the quintessential attributes, divine spheres, and mythic tales embodying the selected presence. Illuminate the aura of devotion, the delicate balance of sacredness, and the profound yearning for transcendental communion as you artistically intertwine the invocation throughout your lyrical creation. Ensure that the complexity of your poem transports the reader into the hidden, enigmatic realm where the divine is called forth, weaving a tapestry of metaphysical and transcendent connection through each line and verse.

In the shadows of twilight, I whisper thy name,
O' keeper of secrets, enshrouded in flame.
Solemn Seraphim, whose visage unseen,
Whence a raven-winged silhouette strays 'midst the gleam.

With quivering breath, the aurora ascends,
From celestine depths, where the astral worlds blend.
Lend ears, O' divine, to my supplications song,
And descend from the realm where thy presence belongs.

Perfusing forbidden ink of shadow and smoke,
Chant imbibed in symbols of spiritual awoke.
For my tongue, infernal alchemy, unseen but felt,
Serenades the luminaries, and cause them to melt.

A celestial romance we shall embody this eve,
Cloaked by the veils, that sepulchre weave,
In the void between realms, lies a flickering light,
From the depths of the abyss, fair Elysium ignites.

Gentle breezes unbind the chains of mortality,
As wings of thy grace lift me toward ethereal unity,
Where secrets untold shimmer within starlit piety,
And dreams unfurl into the tapestry of infinity.

Through murk and wonder, the echo resounds,
Cumulus reflections of thy heavenly sounds.
Birthing regal harmonies from the intertwined waves,
A cosmic sire's lullaby, in the void, it reverberates.

To thee, my heart sings, with devout fervor aflame,
Seeking thy union, in a dance everlasting,
Entwined by the cosmic filaments of divine passion,
Together through timeless eons, forever enraptured.

Oh, revered Seraphim, a primal pulse churns,
Within this sacred space, where the aether returns.
Grant me thy mercy, the knowledge concealed,
In thy cosmic embrace, my soul's journey revealed.
