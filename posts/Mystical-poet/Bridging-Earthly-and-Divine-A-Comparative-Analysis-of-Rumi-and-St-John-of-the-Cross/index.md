In the realm of mystical poetry, the convergence between the sacred and the profane examines the intertwined complexities of earthly, human experiences and the divine's transcendent nature. **The symbiotic relationship between a poet's linguistic artistry and their grasping of the divine can be connected through their ability to convey complex spiritual messages via earthly metaphors, symbols, and imagery. I will explore this intricate relationship by examining the works of two influential mystical poets hailing from different cultural and religious backgrounds**: Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet and Islamic scholar, and St. John of the Cross, a 16th-century Spanish mystic and Catholic priest.

Rumi, born in present-day Afghanistan, has penned many poems that centered around the notion of seeking unity with the divine. **His works manifested in the form of ghazals, lyric poems that often touch upon themes of love and longing. Rumi's poetry is characterized by its rich imagery, metaphors, earthiness, and passion that seeks to bridge the gap between the human and the divine. An example from his famous work, "The Essential Rumi," showcases the transcendental intimacy with the divine**:

"Listen to the story told by the reed,
of being separated.
“Since I was cut from the reedbed,
I have made this crying sound.
Anyone apart from someone he loves
understands what I say.
Anyone pulled from a source
longs to go back."

In this poem, Rumi utilizes the symbolism of the reed to portray separation from the divine source and the longing to reunite with it. The use of earthly imagery, such as the reed, helps convey abstract spiritual ideas in a tangible way, making them accessible to those open to engaging with the poetry.

On the other hand, St. **John of the Cross was a Spanish mystic, priest, and a key figure in the Catholic Reformation. He was known for his vivid descriptions of his spiritual experiences and wrote several poetic works that remain influential in the Roman Catholic Church. St. John of the Cross's poetry is famous for its passionate articulation of the soul's journey towards communion with God. In his poem, "The Dark Night of the Soul," the poet illustrates the arduous path towards ultimate union with the divine**:

"On a dark night,
Kindled in love with yearnings–oh, happy chance!–
I went forth without being observed,
My house being now at rest.

In darkness and secure,
By the secret ladder, disguised–oh, happy chance!–
In darkness and in concealment,
My house being now at rest."

Here, St. John of the Cross conveys the purgative process by which the soul makes a tangled journey through human limitations (dark night) and ultimately finds unity with the divine, "By the secret ladder, disguised." Similar to Rumi, St. John utilizes earthly symbols and imagery to express spiritual metaphors that epitomize the human longing for the divine.

In conclusion, the works of both Rumi and St. John of the Cross clearly showcase the mystical poet's ability to bridge the realms of the sacred and the profane by intertwining symbolic, earthly imagery with abstract spiritual concepts. While coming from distinct cultural and religious backgrounds, both poets exhibit a deep connection with the desire for spiritual unity and transcendence beyond the confines of human limitations. The linguistic artistry of these mystical poets allows readers to interpret and engage with complex spiritual ideas, making these mystics' works timeless and universally appealing.
