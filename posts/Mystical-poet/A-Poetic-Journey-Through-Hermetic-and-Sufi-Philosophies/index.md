description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Mystical poet, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a richly layered poem that intricately weaves together symbolic elements from diverse mystical traditions, such as Kabbalah, Sufism, Hermeticism, and Alchemy. Employ precise language to vividly portray these symbolic components, imbuing the verses with an alluring mystical aura that enlivens the senses and intellect. Moreover, subtly interlink the symbols to fashion a profound underlying message, awakening a transcendent understanding within the reader's soul, elevating the poetry to new heights of esoteric beauty and cosmic resonance.

In the garden of cosmic rebirth, I tread,
Weaving through spheres of branches overhead.
Where Kabbalah whispers tales of Sephirot,
Sufi hearts twirl in divine love's thought.

Hermetic winds spiral around the Moon,
The paths, like Mercury, are swift, bend, and swoon.
Alchemy blends lead into gleaming gold,
Destiny's confluence in a story retold.

Upon the Tree of Life, where spheres align,
In sacred union, the heavens do combine.
The sun and moon embrace in secret lore,
Sufi and Malkuth's rhapsodies, forevermore.

In the distance, Rumi plants the mystic seed,
Where heaven's roses bloom, and earthly passions freed.
With Alchemical fire, we transcend despair,
As Hermes draws our gaze to the celestial stair.

Veiled in shadows, the Sulphur and the Salt,
Transmutations of Mercury, in Eros' vault.
Hermetic dreams merge with Sufi dervish rites,
Dancing through the desert, in the glow of sacred lights.

In path of Ain Soph, the void of endless chance,
Spirals dance amidst the Hermetic trance.
Fleeting whispers from Alhambra's walls,
The wellspring of insight, where Earth's wisdom calls.

Searing through our depths, the spheres unite,
No bars could ever restrain our soaring flight.
Through zeniths unseen, where mysteries dwell,
Guided by love's celestial, timeless spell.

Ascending the Tree of Life, we cast off strife,
Energies converge within the fount of life.
Upon the gilded peaks, stood in awe,
The all-embracing One, the flawless law.

As stars align, with Kabbalah's sacred signs,
Alchemy's blaze â€˜cross infinite designs,
Hermetic echoes, and Sufi devotion soars,
Unto realms beyond, we embrace the mystic shores.
