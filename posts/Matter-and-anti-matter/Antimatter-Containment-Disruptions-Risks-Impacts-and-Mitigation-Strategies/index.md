The ramifications arising from antimatter containment disruptions can be categorized into the following fields: behavioral interactions between Matter and anti-matter, scientific research, technological advancements, environmental impacts, and potential mitigation strategies.

1. **Behavioral Interactions between Matter and Anti-matter**:

In the event of an antimatter containment disruption, the most significant implication is the annihilation events that occur when anti-matter comes into contact with matter. This annihilation liberates a massive amount of energy according to Einstein's equation, E=mc², where E represents the energy released, m is the mass of particles involved, and c is the speed of light.

Quantitative Analysis:
Assuming a containment breach with 1 gram of anti-matter, the energy released would be approximately 1.8 x 10¹⁴ joules, equivalent to 43 kilotons of TNT, or nearly three times the explosive yield of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Probabilistic Modeling:
By incorporating a probabilistic model, we can estimate the likelihood of containment disruptions. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we can assess thousands of scenarios based on containment system failure rates, detection capabilities, and human error. This allows us to generate a range of potential outcomes and evaluate the expected consequences of antimatter containment disruptions.

2. **Scientific Research**:

Containment breaches could significantly impact scientific research involving antimatter. Any loss of this extremely valuable and scarce resource would hinder progress in various fields, including medical applications (e.g. PET scans), propulsion, and fundamental physics.

3. **Technological Advancements**:

A containment disruption may lead to increased research and development efforts to create safer, more efficient containment systems. This would likely have a cascading impact on the development of other technologies, such as the design and implementation of fusion reactors, advanced energy storage, and propulsion systems.

4. **Environmental Impact**:

Micro-scale:
The immediate environmental impact, in the vicinity of the disruption, would result from the explosion and accompanying release of high-energy gamma radiation, potentially causing immediate harm to both humans and the environment.

Macro-scale:
The global environmental impact depends on the scale of the disruption. Effects may include the production of high volumes of ozone-damaging chemicals and possible changes in global atmospheric patterns due to the sudden release of energy.

5. **Potential Mitigation Strategies and Technological Innovations**:

Preventative measures, such as regular maintenance and strict adherence to safety protocols, can minimize the risk of disruption. In addition, redundant containment systems and fail-safe mechanisms, such as vacuum flasks or remote isolation procedures, can help contain antimatter in case of a disruption.

Moreover, research into novel containment methods, like magnetic or electrostatic confinement, could lead to more secure technologies and significantly reduce the risks associated with antimatter containment disruptions.

In conclusion, antimatter containment disruptions pose significant challenges on multiple fronts. Understanding the complexities of Matter and anti-matter interactions, combined with ongoing research and development of containment technologies, can help mitigate the risks and consequences associated with such events and pave the way for more advanced applications of antimatter in the future.
