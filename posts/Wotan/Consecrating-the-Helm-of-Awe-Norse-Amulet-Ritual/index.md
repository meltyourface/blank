Blueprint: 

The amulet consists of a circular base made of darkwood or worked iron, with a diameter of 2 inches. The surface is adorned with intricate carvings and engravings, surrounding a central powerful symbol â€“ the Helm of Awe. 

The Helm of Awe itself is a series of eight interconnected arms composed of a central circle, which contains a single precious gemstone (such as amethyst, sapphire, or garnet) representing the "eye" of Wotan. From this central gemstone, the arms extend outward, ending in a series of sharp-edged points. Between the arms, eight additional gemstones are embedded, each symbolizing the protective qualities and blessings of nature as represented by Wotan.

The detailed engraved elements include flower-like patterns representing the Yggdrasil, the World Tree, and intertwining, weaved runes symbolizing the binds of the Norns, the three wise women who dictate the fate of all beings. Unique, ancient sigils are engraved around the gemstones, adding an extra layer of protection and strength to the amulet. Skilfully carved dragon heads decoratively interlock with the magics surrounding the amulet.

Hidden Meanings and Esoteric Properties:

The circular base of the amulet signifies the cyclical nature of life in the Norse cosmos. The Helm of Awe, the focal point of the amulet, offers protection and insurmountable strength to the wearer, drawing upon Wotan's power. Each of the eight arms represents one of the eight winds, as well as the eight directions of the compass. The nine gemstones inlaid on the amulet represent the nine realms within the Norse cosmology. 

Moreover, the dragon heads reflect the legendary Norse dragons, Jormungand and Nidhogg, who embody the eternal struggle against chaos. The engravings of the World Tree symbolize life and its interconnectedness, while the Norns indicate the power of fate and destiny in the mortal realm.

Enchantment Process and Rituals:

To imbue the amulet with Wotan's divine protection, follow these consecration steps:

1. Prepare for the ritual on a night empowered by Wotan, such as the Celtic festival of Samhain. Ensure the amulet's completion aligns with this auspicious occasion.

2. Arrange a sacred space outdoors, influenced by Wotan's presence. Place the amulet at the center of an altar, adorned with white candles, offerings of mead, animal bones, and sacred herbs like mugwort and hawthorn. 

3. Invoke Wotan by chanting an invocation in Old Norse; light the white candles as the invocation continues.

4. Once Wotan's presence is felt, carefully offer a libation of mead in His honor, requesting His protection and guidance over the amulet.

5. Proceed with an incantation over each of the nine gemstones, addressing the realm it represents and requesting its specific protection. Recite the incantation three times each.

6. Finally, perform a rune-reading as a means of communication with the divine, seeking Wotan's approval of the amulet's consecration. Afterward, let the candles burn out completely.

Upon completing this ritual, the amulet will be imbued with Wotan's divine protection, offering its wearer unparalleled strength, guidance, and the power of the divine.
