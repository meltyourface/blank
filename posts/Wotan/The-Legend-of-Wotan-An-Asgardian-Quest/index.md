description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Wotan, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: > 
  Compose a compelling and enigmatic verse that delves into the depths of Wotan's quest for enlightenment, detailing his sacrifice at the World Tree, Yggdrasil, and the subsequent acquisition of the divine Runes. Challenge yourself to incorporate a minimum of three Norse mythological beings and two prophetic visions of the cosmos to heighten the complexity of your poem, while employing a distinct rhyme scheme and alliteration to convey the power and mystique of the Allfather's journey toward wisdom.

Within the realm of Asgard, where gods and men entwine,
There reigns an Allfather famed, Wotan whispers his name,
Embarking on his arduous quest, illumination to find,
Mark thee well, my aged verse, as his legend I proclaim.

In shadows cast by Yggdrasil, the World Tree standing tall,
Did Wotan seek his fateful goal, high and low he'd scry,
Amongst the branches soared a hawk, Veðrfölnir by its call,
While Níðhöggr, the serpent, gnawed at roots with malice sly.

Huginn and Muninn, ravens dark, flanked Wotan's sides,
Their wisdom vast, of worldly things, resounded in their cries,
Yet 'twas the sight unseen by all, from Heimdall's
