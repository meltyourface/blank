To design a powerful talisman tailored for the protection of a time-traveling explorer and their mummified companion, we will incorporate ancient Egyptian mystical elements, hieroglyphs, sacred symbols, and materials commonly used in ancient Egyptian magical practices. The talisman's design will be further enriched by developing a unique combination of spells and rituals from the Book of the Dead to activate its properties.

Talisman design:

**Shape**: The talisman will take the form of an Eye of Horus (Wadjet), a symbol of protection, power, and good health in ancient Egypt. This amulet shape will provide both defense and reinforcement required during time-traveling expeditions.

Materials:
1. Gold: To symbolize divine energy, eternity, and purity.
2. Lapis Lazuli: A gemstone associated with wisdom and truth, often used in ancient Egyptian jewelry and sculptures.
3. Carnelian: A stone linked to protection, strength, and courage.

Hieroglyphs and Symbols:
1. Cartouche: A protective hieroglyphic emblem enclosing the name of a Pharaoh or deity. Our cartouche will house the time-traveler's name, imbuing the talisman with personal protection.
2. Ankh: The symbol of eternal life, often carried by Egyptian gods and associated with rebirth.
3. Djed Pillar: An emblem representing stability, strength, and protection.

Protective Spells and Rituals:
To activate the talisman's properties, we will combine a selection of protective spells and rituals found within the Book of the Dead. These will ensure maximum security for our time-traveler and their mummified companion.

1. Spell 151: A safeguarding spell for protection and preservation of the dead, ensuring resilience and defense for the mummy and our time-traveler in times of danger.
2. Spell 125: The Judgment of Osiris, signifying our explorer's pure heart and honest intentions, crucial to maintain during their time-traveling journeys.
3. Spell 130: A powerful invocation for traversing time and space, which provides safe passage through unknown realms.

Upon the completion of the talisman's design, it should be consecrated in a sacred ritual involving incense, candlelight, and the recitation of the selected spells from the Book of the Dead. Once activated, the talisman will act as a potent shield and guide for both the time-traveler and their mummified companion during their daring adventures, safeguarding them from unseen dangers and mystical threats throughout time and space.
