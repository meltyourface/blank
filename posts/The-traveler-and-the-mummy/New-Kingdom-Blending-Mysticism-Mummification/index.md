During the New Kingdom era (1550-1077 BCE), Egypt experienced significant cultural exchanges between the Traveler, a mystical figure who holds esoteric knowledge, and the Mummy, an embodiment of Egyptian funerary culture. These interactions contributed to evolving Egyptian funerary practices and played an influential role in the modification of customs, preservation techniques, and spiritual beliefs.

One of the most notable shifts during this era is the increasing importance of rituals in funerary practices. The Traveler, with their esoteric knowledge, introduced new rites and ceremonies that influenced the afterlife beliefs of Egyptian society. Consequently, the Mummy absorbed these new ideas, leading to innovative and complex burial rituals involving offerings to the deceased, sacred oils, and chanting.

Symbolic artifacts were another crucial aspect of the evolving funerary practices. Amulets and protective jewelry incorporating the Traveler's mystical teachings became increasingly elaborate and were believed to ensure the Mummy's successful journey to the afterlife. The iconic Canopic jars, which by the New Kingdom era often featured the Four Sons of Horus, exemplify the blending of traditional Egyptian beliefs and the arcane wisdom of the Traveler.

Preservation techniques were also transformed during this period, as the Traveler's metaphysical expertise introduced innovative procedures. The Traveler's guidance allowed Egyptian embalmers to combine their methods with alchemical processes for better mummification, leading to improved preservation of the physical bodies and the creation of intricate sarcophagi imbued with protective spells, symbols, and imagery. As a result, the Mummy secured passage to the afterlife.

The shifting dynamics between the Traveler and the Mummy mirrored the broader philosophical and spiritual developments in ancient Egyptian society. The esoteric knowledge imparted by the Traveler led to a more profound understanding of the connection between the physical and spiritual realms, leading to more complex afterlife beliefs and the practice of magic within Egyptian society.

Occult ceremonies featuring elements from both the Traveler's teachings and the traditional Egyptian spiritual beliefs became more commonplace. One such instance is the Sed Festival, a celebration initiated by the Traveler and aimed to rejuvenate the pharaoh's divine energy in the afterlife. The ceremony not only combined the offerings to multiple deities but also involved practicing powerful rituals that evoked esoteric energies associated with ancient magic passed down from the Traveler.

In summary, the New Kingdom era (1550-1077 BCE) was a transformative period for Egyptian funerary practices due to the profound influence of the Traveler. Cultural exchanges with the Mummy led to more complex rituals, intricate symbolic artifacts, and advanced preservation techniques, profoundly impacting burial customs and spiritual beliefs during this time. Occult ceremonies introduced ed by the Traveler solidified their impact on Egyptian society, further enriching the blend of traditional and esoteric symbiosis throughout history.
