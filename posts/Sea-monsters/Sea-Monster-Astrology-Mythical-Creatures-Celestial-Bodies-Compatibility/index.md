l. **Glaciovore**: A giant sea beast enclosed in ice, resembling a prehistoric creature. Glaciovorites are resilient, patient, and strong-willed.

2. **Celestial Bodies**:
Each zodiac sign has an associated constellation representing their respective sea monster, along with two bright stars symbolizing their dominant traits. Additionally, four planets correlate with the elemental affinities of the zodiac signs: Pyros (Fire), Gaianus (Earth), Aemoreum (Air), and Hydrosia (Water).

When a zodiac constellation aligns with its associated planet, energy flows through that specific sea monster, granting it additional power. Furthermore, the proximity of other zodiac constellations to these celestial bodies influences each sign's power dynamics.

3. **Sea Monster Calendar**:
The astrological year begins with the Janurayd constellation, while the remaining signs follow in the order listed. **Key astrological events include**:

- Planetary conjunctions with a zodiac constellation, particularly elemental ones, magnify the sea monster's influence.
- Retrogrades occur when a planet appears to move backward through the zodiac, often creating turbulence and upheaval for a specific sea monster sign.
- Eclipses bring significant shifts in power for all signs, requiring sea monster vigilance.

4. **Compatibility and Relationships**:
Compatibility between sea monster zodiac signs relies on three factors: mythological aspect, elemental affinity, and celestial connection.

Generally, signs with the same elemental affinity share strong compatibility, while opposite elements create an intense and passionate, yet potentially tumultuous, bond. Mythological connections allow for insightful and intuitive relationships, and harmonious celestial interactions foster supportive and dynamic partnerships.

5. **Horoscope Predictions**:
Daily, weekly, and monthly horoscope predictions for each sea monster zodiac sign require a deep understanding of the celestial interactions and their influence on the individual creatures. As such, astrologers must possess the necessary knowledge of planetary movements and their consequences on sea monsters' power fluctuations and relationships in order to create accurate predictions.
