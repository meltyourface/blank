## Astral Vision Herbal Blend

Ingredients:

1. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - 30%
2. Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) - 20%
3. Blue Lotus (Nymphaea caerulea) - 15%
4. Damiana (Turnera diffusa) - 10%
5. Calea Zacatechichi (Calea ternifolia) - 10%
6. Sandalwood (Santalum album) - 10%
7. Palo Santo (Bursera graveolens) - 5%

Preparation:
**Step 1**: Harvest and dry the herbs
Ensure that all herbs are organically sourced or harvested without any harmful pesticides or chemicals. Each herb should be properly air-dried in a shaded place with sufficient air circulation.
**Step 2**: Measure the herbs
Using a digital scale, measure out the percentages of each herb listed above. The final amount should be tailored to the amount needed for the ceremony. Ensure that all calculations are done accurately, as the precise proportions are essential for potent, synergistic effects and mitigating potential contraindications.
**Step 3**: Grind the herbs
Separately grind each herb to achieve a fine consistency. This will ensure an even burn during the ceremonial burning and promote the release of the metaphysical properties.
**Step 4**: Blend the herbs
Combine the ground herbs in a large container and mix them thoroughly. This will ensure each ingredient is evenly distributed throughout the blend, creating a well-rounded and harmonious mixture that encourages heightened astral sensitivity and transcendent astral awareness.

Ceremonial Burning:
**Step 1**: Set the stage
Prepare a sacred space for the Ceremony of the Opening of the Veil, ensuring it is energetically cleansed and suitably arranged for the ritual. Light a circle of candles to mark the ritual area and create an altar with sacred objects and representations of the elements.
**Step 2**: Burn the blend
Fill a ceremonial incense burner or heatproof container with sand or a layer of ash. Place a charcoal disc into the container and light it, allowing it to become fully ignited and white around the edges. Sprinkle a small amount of the Astral Vision Herbal Blend onto the charcoal disc, allowing the smoke to rise and permeate the ritual space.
**Step 3**: Perform the ritual
Conduct the Ceremony of the Opening of the Veil, incorporating the sacred actions, chants, and invocations suited to the esoteric tradition being practiced. Allow the expertly crafted blend's smoke to envelop the space, promoting transcendent astral awareness and enhancing the mystical rite's potency and depth.
**Step 4**: Close the veil
Upon completing the ceremony, take the time to thank the entities, energies, and elements invoked. Extinguish the candles and cleanse the space, sealing the energetic framework of the ritual and bringing the astral exploration back to the mundane world.
