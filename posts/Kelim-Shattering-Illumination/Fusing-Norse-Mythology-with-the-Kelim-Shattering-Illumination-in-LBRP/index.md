To complete the task, we will incorporate the intricacies of the Kelim-Shattering Illumination into the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) with the focus on the Norse mythological pantheon as the chosen cultural foundation. The revisions will center on the directional quarters and their elemental correspondence, intertwining the selected deities or mythological beings with their respective attributes.

1. Preparation:
Begin by grounding yourself at the center of your ritual space and visualize yourself connecting to the energies of the cosmos and the earth. Feel the power of the Kelim-Shattering Illumination within you, shattering the barriers between mundane and spiritual realms.

2. Invocation of the Norse Pantheon:
Call upon the mighty Æsir and Vanir, the principal Norse gods and goddesses, to guide and protect you throughout the ritual. Invoke the All-Father Odin, the seductive Freyja, and the noble Thor to be present and to lend you their wisdom, insight, and strength.

3. Creating the Pentagram:
Next, draw a banishing Earth pentagram, starting from the lower left corner to the upper right, using the energy from the Kelim-Shattering Illumination. This modified pentagram will incorporate the energy of the Norse realm while still maintaining the elemental Earth connection to strengthen your protection.

4. Elemental Directional Quarters:

- East (Air):
Incorporate the deity Freyr. As a god associated with fertility and abundance, he represents the nourishing and life-giving breath of the wind. Feel his presence as you draw the Air pentagram, envisioning golden yellow light surrounding the Ritual space.

- South (Fire):
Associate the powerful Thor with the Fire element in the south. He brings the transformative power of lightning and the protection of the warrior spirit. While drawing the Fire pentagram, imagine his mighty hammer Mjölnir forging a blazing and protective barrier.

- West (Water):
In the west, delve into the connection between the element of Water and the goddess Njord. As the father of Freyr and Freyja and a deity strongly connected to the sea, Njord effectively mirrors the ebbing and flowing energies of water. Visualize a shimmering, silvery-blue pentagram as you incorporate his essence.

- North (Earth):
Finally, in the north, assign Jörd, the earth goddess and mother of Thor, as the embodiment of Earth. As a representation of the physical world, she strengthens and stabilizes the ritual space, providing an essential anchor. Envision a deep, emerald green pentagram to complete the circle.

5. Invocation of the Kelim-Shattering Angels:
At each quarter, invoke the ancient, cosmic energies of the Kelim-Shattering Illumination by calling on its four guardian angels: Raphael in the east, Michael in the south, Gabriel in the west, and Uriel in the north. Envision their presence, connecting them to the Norse pantheon and grounding the ritual within this divine synthesis.

6. Completion:
End the ritual by focusing once more on your grounded center, feeling the interconnected energies of the directional quarters and the profound presence of the Norse pantheon. Thank the gods and goddesses for their assistance and close the ritual with an affirmation of your intent for the Kelim-Shattering Illumination to manifest powerfully in your life.

Following these steps, a transformative rendition of the LBRP has been achieved, melding the Norse mythological pantheon with the Kelim-Shattering Illumination for enhanced potency.
