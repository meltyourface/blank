In order to address this knowledge challenge, let's first understand the geographical, historical, and cultural contexts that defined ancient Sumer and Egypt, and delve into the origins, symbolic representations, and sociopolitical impacts of their respective mythological archetypes. We will then examine how these archetypes and belief systems influenced modern esoteric and occult practices.

Ancient Sumer, located in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), was one of the world's earliest civilizations, dating back to around 4500 BCE. It consisted of a collection of city-states, each with their own unique pantheon of gods and belief systems. Ancient Egypt, situated along the Nile River in northeastern Africa, emerged around 3100 BCE and was characterized by its intricate social hierarchy, polytheistic religion, and monumental architecture.

When examining the origins of the mythological archetypes in both civilizations, it becomes evident that they were heavily influenced by natural phenomena and environmental factors. In Sumer, the unpredictable flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers led to the belief in gods who controlled these destructive forces, such as Enlil and Enki. Similarly, in Egypt, the cosmological deities- including Ra, the sun god, and Osiris, the god of the underworld and fertility- played prominent roles in their mythologies due to the significance of the Nile flood cycle and solar phenomena in agricultural activities.

In terms of symbolic representations, Sumerian and Egyptian mythologies utilized strikingly different imagery. Sumerian gods were often depicted as anthropomorphic, possessing human-like qualities, while Egyptian deities frequently assumed the form of therianthropic beings, amalgamating human and animal elements. However, both cultures placed great importance on the divine connection between rulers and their deities; this was exemplified by the Sumerian belief in the 'me,' essentially divine powers bestowed upon kings by the gods, and the Egyptian concept of Pharaohs being incarnations of the god Horus.

Moreover, the sociopolitical impacts of these mythological archetypes are profound in both civilizations. They determined the structure of society, ascribing divine attributes to rulers and legitimizing their authority. Additionally, they provided moral frameworks to guide the actions and beliefs of the masses. This can be seen in Sumerian texts like The Epic of Gilgamesh or Egyptian funerary texts such as the Book of the Dead, which outline the ethical codes and guidelines for a virtuous life, directly influenced by their respective mythological beliefs.

Now, let us explore the connection between these ancient belief systems and their influence on modern esoteric and occult practices. Gnostic and Hermetic traditions, which have their roots in the late antique period (around the 1st to 3rd centuries CE), demonstrate how elements from Sumerian and Egyptian beliefs were incorporated into new religious syncretisms. For example, the Sumerian concept of the 'me' bears similarities with the Gnostic idea of 'gnosis,' while the Hermetic tradition derives some of its symbolism and beliefs from the ancient Egyptian god Thoth, a pivotal figure in magic, writing, and wisdom.

The step-by-step process of examining these ancient belief systems indeed reveals their lasting impact on modern esoteric and occult practices. Theosophy, a 19th-century spiritual movement, imbibes several aspects of Egyptian and Sumerian mythologies, while secret societies such as the Freemasons incorporate elements of ancient Egyptian symbolism and architecture in their rituals and iconography.

In conclusion, the development of belief systems in ancient Sumer and Egypt can be traced back to the impact of natural phenomena, geographical contexts, and synchronous sociopolitical structures. The integration of their respective mythological archetypes - such as anthropomorphic gods in Sumer and therianthropic deities in Egypt - not only shaped the foundations of these civilizations but transcended time and space to influence modern esoteric and occult practices that continue to thrive in contemporary spirituality.
