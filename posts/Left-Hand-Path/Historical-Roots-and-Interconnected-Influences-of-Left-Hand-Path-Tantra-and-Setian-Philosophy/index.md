The Left Hand Path, Tantra, and Setian philosophy all have deep historical roots and interconnected influences that have shaped the development of their unique practices, rituals, and principles. To fully understand the historical connection between these traditions, it is essential to delve into their individual histories, development, and major teachings.

The Left Hand Path (LHP) is an ancient term referring to a wide variety of spiritual paths that are typically associated with individualism, self-deification, and exploration of the darker or "hidden" aspects of reality. It often seeks personal empowerment and embraces unconventional methods, utilizing knowledge and practices that mainstream society deems taboo. Key characteristics of the LHP include a focus on the self, antinomianism (the belief that moral laws are not applicable to oneself), and the pursuit of gnosis (knowledge) through unconventional methods.

Tantra, originating in medieval India, is a broad category of spiritual practices and philosophical underpinnings that center around the integration of the mundane with the sacred, the physical with the spiritual. Tantric practices often employ visualization, mantra, and ritual to achieve union with the divine as well as inner transformation. Tantra is often divided into the "Right Hand Path" (Dakshinachara) and the "Left Hand Path" (Vamachara). The latter incorporates rituals and practices that are considered unorthodox, transcending societal norms, and sometimes involving taboo subjects, such as sexuality or the consumption of substances deemed impure.

Setian philosophy is focused on the worship and veneration of the ancient Egyptian deity Set, who was often associated with chaos, darkness, and individuality. The Temple of Set, established in 1975 by Michael A. Aquino, is a modern Left Hand Path organization that embraces Setian philosophy. Setians seek self-deification, acquiring knowledge and willpower to achieve their own evolution and transformation. The Setian philosophy borrows ideas from the darker aspects of ancient Egyptian religion, Gnosticism, and Western Hermeticism as well as concepts from the broader LHP.

Exploring these historical connections, one can observe the mutual influences among LHP traditions, Tantra, and Setian philosophy. Tantra, with its dualistic nature, heavily inspired the LHP, particularly in its Vamachara aspect that centers on breaking societal norms and using taboo practices to achieve spiritual transformation. The concept of inner transformation and the search for hidden knowledge in Tantra resonates with LHP principles.

In turn, the LHP has informed the practices found in Vamachara Tantra. Both share an emphasis on embracing the dark, the taboo, and the pursuit of personal power. This fusion of ideas can be seen in the way that LHP practitioners often adopt elements from Tantra, such as sexual rituals and meditation techniques.

Setian philosophy draws inspiration from the broader LHP tradition, with its focus on self-deification and individualism. Additionally, ideas from Tantra can also be found in Setian practices, particularly in the use of rituals and visualization techniques for personal transformation. By embracing these diverse influences, Setian philosophy evolves into a unique form of the LHP tailored to the specific needs and goals of its practitioners.

In summary, the historical connection between the Left Hand Path traditions, Tantra, and Setian philosophy demonstrates a symbiotic relationship, with each system influencing the others in the development of distinctive practices, rituals, and principles. Tantra, especially its Vamachara aspects, has deeply influenced the LHP, focusing on embracing the taboo and the pursuit of inner transformation. Setian philosophy, in turn, has emerged as a unique LHP tradition that brings together elements from ancient Egyptian religion, Tantra, Gnosticism, and Western Hermeticism to create a personalized path for self-deification and the discovery of hidden knowledge.
