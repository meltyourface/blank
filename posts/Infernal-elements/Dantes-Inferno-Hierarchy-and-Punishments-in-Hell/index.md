First Circle: Limbo

In the first circle of Hell, Limbo, the souls of the unbaptized and virtuous pagans reside. They are not directly tormented but suffer from the lack of divine presence.

1. **Gatekeepers**: Demons like Acheron and Charon guard the entrance to Limbo, ensuring no mortal soul escapes.

**Second Circle**: Lust

This circle houses those who are consumed by lust and sensuality.

1. **Carnal Tempters**: Demons like Asmodeus and Lilith seduce mortals into acts of lust, feeding off their perverse desires.
2. **Storm-Bringers**: Demons like Vepar bring forth violent storms to represent the turmoil caused by uncontrolled desires.

**Third Circle**: Gluttony

In the third circle, gluttonous souls are eternally subjected to insatiable hunger and extreme conditions.

1. **Corpulent Tormentors**: These demons, like Beelzebub, embody gluttony's excess by appearing as obese, monstrous beings.
2. **Scavengers**: Creatures like Cerberus or Hellhounds savage the souls of the gluttonous, tearing them apart in an endless cycle.

**Fourth Circle**: Greed

Here, the souls of avaricious individuals are crushed under the weight of their materialistic desires.

1. **Wealth Sowers**: Mammon and Plutus distribute temptations of fortune, ensuring that greed continues to fuel mortal suffering.
2. **Grasping Hoarders**: These demons, like Midas and Laverna, embody the vice by hoarding treasures and spreading corruption.

**Fifth Circle**: Anger

This circle is dedicated to souls consumed by anger and vengeance.

1. **Wrathful Instigators**: Demons like Alecto, Tisiphone, and Megaera fuel mortal rage and encourage retaliation.
2. **Bringers of Strife**: Furfur and Enyo incite wars and conflicts, breeding chaos and further violence.

**Sixth Circle**: Heresy

In the sixth circle, heretics suffer for their denial of divine truths.

1. **Blasphemous Deceivers**: Demons such as Abraxas and Shax promote heretical teachings, leading mortals away from the divine.
2. **Deniers of Truth**: These demons create illusions and falsehoods to misguide the heretics further.

**Seventh Circle**: Violence

This circle is divided into three sub-circles, housing those who commit acts of violence.

1. **Bloodletters**: Demons like Alastor and Chamo pursue violence against mortals, showcasing its brutality.
2. **Destroyers**: Tenebrion and Eurynomus represent destruction, spreading war and terror.
3. **Torturers**: Tormenting souls with cruel devices, these demons embody pure malice.

**Eighth Circle**: Fraud

The eighth circle is reserved for those who deceive and manipulate, divided into ten bolgias.

1. **Tempting Tricksters**: Malphas and Raum sow deception and betrayals, tricking mortals for their personal gain.
2. **Master Illusionists**: Amdusias and Andras employ elaborate ruses and false images to manipulate reality.

**Ninth Circle**: Treachery

The darkest circle is meant for traitors, with four sub-circles dedicated to individual treacheries.

1. **Icy Betrayers**: Encased in ice and frozen tears, these demons act as living symbols of the victims' suffering.
2. **Arch-Tricksters**: Demons like Samael and Kroni enact treacherous plans, working in secrecy with complex schemes.

Governing Structure, Alliances, and Rivalries:

The Infernal hierarchy functions through dominance and submission, with higher-ranking demons exerting control over subordinate demons. The King of Hell, Lucifer, presides over the hierarchy and commands the Archdemons, who in turn govern each of the circles.

Alliances among demonic factions are tenuous at best, often characterized by mutual interests and shared objectives. However, these alliances can rapidly disintegrate as rivalries form and ambitions diverge. Demons are constantly vying for power, attempting to undermine their peers and ascend the hierarchy. Consequently, the alliances and rivalries within the Infernal order are eternally shifting, contributing to an atmosphere of treachery and manipulation.
