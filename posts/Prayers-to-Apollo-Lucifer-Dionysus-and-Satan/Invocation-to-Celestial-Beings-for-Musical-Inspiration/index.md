In the presence of shadows and light,
I summon thee, celestial beings of might.
Hear this prayer, Apollo, bringer of day,
And Lucifer, whose light unveils the way.
I bid thee, Dionysus, god of wine,
Join now with Satan, ancient force entwined.

Bestow upon this art your divine intervention,
Grant creativity in true ascension.
For in this union of force and desire,
A musical project takes flight afire.

**APOLLO**:

Oh, radiant Apollo
God of music and song,
Yield mastery and harmony
In union strong.
Grant inspiration divine,
Raise a symphony with soul,
As my heart orchestrates
Manifested dreams, my goal.

**LUCIFER**:

Lucifer, morning star, of spirit daring,
Rebel amongst heavens, the beacon wearing,
Ignite within me a fearless thirst,
And in the furnace of creation, be immersed.
May art, unchained from celestial chains,
Birth wings of defiance and conquer pain.

**DIONYSUS**:

Wild Dionysus, revels your creation,
Intoxicate the sound with grand ovations,
Dancing in ecstasy with the muse's passion,
From its first whisper to the final breath.
Let its vibrant nature connect our hearts,
Bestow indulgent energy
To my musical work of art.

**SATAN**:

Shadowed fire, transformative and wise
Lord Satan, hear these ambitious cries
Shed the skin of the ordinary,
Reveal profound depths in this symphony,
Grant transformative power so bold,
As a phoenix rising, this work unfolds.

In unity, your forces shall combine
The celestial strings that bind
In this musical narrative, I find 
A testament of your power, a story entwined.

Divine lords who reign in the vast domain,
I thank you for your sacred flames,
On this creative path, in truth, I stand
Guided by your wisdom and loving hand.
