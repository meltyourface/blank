## Chapter: Infamous Occult Societies and Their Philosophies

Introduction

Throughout history, various infamous occult societies have shaped the foundations, beliefs, practices, and rituals of esoteric knowledge. These societies often flourished in secrecy, affording their members a level of freedom to explore hidden realms, manipulate energies, and wield unique powers. This chapter delves into the inner workings of these enigmatic groups, detailing their origins, philosophies and the reasons for their secrecy to equip initiates with a comprehensive understanding of the occult landscape.

### I. The Knights Templar

The Knights Templar, founded in 1118, was initially a military order pledged to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem. Over time, the organization grew into a powerful and wealthy order amassing vast knowledge related to sacred relics and esoteric wisdom. They adopted rituals and symbols drawn from ancient mystery schools and the Kabbalistic traditions of Judaism. Believed to have knowledge on the Holy Grail and the creation of the first banking system, the Knights Templar were eventually disbanded, and its members persecuted under the orders of King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V in 1307. This dissolution, however, did not end the reach of their hidden teachings, as their legacy continues to inspire other secret societies and conspiracy theories.

### II. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn

In the late 19th century, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn emerged amid the reviving interest in occultism and mysticism. Founders William Wynn Westcott, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, and William Robert Woodman incorporated teachings from various esoteric sources, including the Kabbalah, Hermeticism, astrology, tarot, and alchemy. Members progressed through a series of degrees or grades, undergoing initiations representative of the journey toward spiritual enlightenment. Although the order disbanded in the early 20th century, it substantially influenced the development of modern Western occultism. The Golden Dawn's initiatory system introduced the concept of self-development through spiritual practices, meditation, and study, which made it an essential philosophy for those seeking personal transformation.

### III. The Rosicrucians

The Rosicrucians, a mystical brotherhood dating back to the early 17th century, originated with the publication of manifestos, including the "Fama Fraternitatis" and the "Confessio Fraternitatis." At its core, the Rosicrucian movement blended Christian mysticism with Hermeticism, alchemy, and Kabbalistic teachings. Although there is no concrete historical evidence of their existence, the belief in the secret wisdom and spiritual transformation held by the order has persisted over time. Later organizations, such as the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) and the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross, embraced and expanded the Rosicrucian principles.

### IV. The Ordo Templi Orientis

The Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), founded in the early 20th century, drew inspiration from various occult sources, including the Knights Templar, Freemasonry, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The organization underwent drastic changes when Aleister Crowley, a renowned occultist and magician, assumed a leading role. Integrating his spiritual system called Thelema, Crowley refashioned the OTO practices and rituals according to his beliefs. Central to the teachings of Crowley and the OTO is the Law of Thelema, encapsulated in the phrase: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This doctrine emphasizes the importance of discovering and enacting one's True Will, a concept that has significantly influenced contemporary occult thought.

### V. Secrecy of Infamous Occult Societies

The necessity for secrecy amongst these occult societies stemmed from various factors, including potential persecution and an inherent desire to maintain the sanctity of the esoteric knowledge. Through the veil of secrecy, these societies have managed to safeguard spiritual and philosophical truths from those who would exploit or suppress them, ensuring their continuity and preservation.

Conclusion

The study of occult societies is integral to understanding the diverse and complex tapestry of esoteric thought and practice. Through the exploration of these secret orders, initiates can discern connections, similarities, and influences that have shaped the development of a rich and thriving mystical tradition. It is our responsibility, as students of the occult, to honor these foundations' teachings while deepening our own wisdom and understanding of the esoteric arts.
