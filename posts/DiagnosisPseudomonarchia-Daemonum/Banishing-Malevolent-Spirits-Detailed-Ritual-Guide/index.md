## I. Preparation
In order to conduct the comprehensive and secure ritual, the practitioner must first prepare themselves, their surroundings, and gather necessary materials. Prior to the ritual, take time to research and identify the specific malevolent spirit, this will aid in tailoring the ritual.

1. **Ritual Tools and Materials**
- A protective amulet or talisman (preferably containing the practitioner's personal sigil)
- Sigils, corresponding with the spirit and the sacred geometry involved in the ritual
- Chalk or salt (for creating the ritual circle and sacred geometry)
- Incense or smudging materials (sage, cedar, etc.)
- A candle (specifically chosen to represent the spirit's opposing element)
- A small handheld mirror
- A purification and anointing oil (such as Holy water or a blend of essential oils)
- A written incantation or invocation tailored to the abilities and nature of the spirit, including its summoning, confrontation, and banishment

2. **Ritual Area**
Select a quiet, secluded space indoors or outdoors, where the ritual can be performed without interruption. Ensure the area is clean and tidy.

### II. Constructing the Ritual Circle and Sacred Geometry
1. Create a circle with chalk or salt in the center of the ritual space. The circle should be large enough for the practitioner and any bystanders to comfortably stand or sit within. This circle represents a boundary between the mundane world and the spiritual realm.

2. Within the circle, draw a heptagram (seven-pointed star) connecting its points with lines to form a web-like pattern. Place the practitioner's personal sigil at the center of the star.

3. Surrounding the heptagram, evenly place the spirit-specific sigils, creating a pattern that resonates with the energies needed to confront and banish the spirit.

### III. The Ritual
1. Begin by lighting the incense and candle, letting the smoke cleanse and purify the ritual space. Sprinkle the anointing oil or Holy water on the mirror, sigils, and around the circle's perimeter, consecrating these items for the ritual.

2. Enter the ritual circle, wearing the protective amulet or talisman. Close the circle behind you by tracing the chalk or salt line. This will lock in the protective energies and prevent the malevolent spirit from crossing the boundary.

3. Stand or sit in the center of the heptagram—facing the direction deemed most potent for the spirit in question—and take a few deep breaths to center and ground yourself.

4. Begin reciting the prepared incantation or invocation. As you speak the words, hold the mirror in front of you to reflect and confront the spirit's energies. The sacred geometry, sigils, and elements present in this ritual will amplify and support your intentions.

5. Once the spirit has no choice but to reveal its presence, continue reciting the incantation, shifting the focus toward banishing the spirit from your environment, binding its abilities, or sending it back to its respective plane.

6. When the incantation is complete, confidently command the spirit to leave your presence and never return. Extinguish the candle, signaling the end of the ritual, and dispose of it safely.

### IV. Closing the Ritual and Ensuring Safety
1. Thank your higher power or guides for their assistance in the ritual.

2. Open the circle by wiping away a small portion of the chalk or salt line. Walk out of the circle and close it behind you.

3. Dismantle the sigils and sacred geometry, and cleanse the ritual area with incense, ensuring no residual energies remain.

4. To prevent any lingering energies or retaliation, cleanse and protect yourself, bystanders, and your home, by smudging with sage, sprinkling salt around the perimeter, and displaying protective symbols or talismans.

By following this ritual, the practitioner effectively combines the arcane knowledge and methods from the esoteric principles of DiagnosisPseudomonarchia Daemonum. The detailed use of sigils, sacred geometry, and incantations strengthens the process of identification, confrontation, and banishment of malevolent spirits, ensuring the safety of all parties involved.
