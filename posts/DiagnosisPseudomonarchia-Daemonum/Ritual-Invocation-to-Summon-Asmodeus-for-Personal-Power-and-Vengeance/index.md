I have chosen to create a ritual invocation tailored to summon Asmodeus, one of the most powerful and high-ranking daemons in the hierarchy of hell, according to the DiagnosisPseudomonarchia Daemonum.

Invocation of Asmodeus
-------------------------------

Asmodeus, mighty daemon of passion and desire, ruler of gambling and revenge, heed my call and manifest within the sacred circle. I summon thee, Asmoday, by the secret names of the seventy-two demons, Asmodaios and Aeshma Daeva, to heed my call and fulfill my desires.

I inscribe upon this parchment the sigil of Asmodeus, the ever-watching serpent entwined within the three-headed dragon, symbolizing your cunning, power, and unwavering gaze. I light the black candle, representing thy dominion over darkness and the unknown, and the red candle, igniting the fires of lust, jealousy, and vengeance that burn within your essence.

Adorned in a black ritual robe with the emblem of your sigil, I stand at the edge of the circle, holding the ceremonial dagger to the east, where the power of intellect and light converge. With copal, cedar, and dragon's blood, I burn the incense that pleases you, invoking your presence within the sacred space.

Ingredients of your favored elixirs, the blood of a snake, the ink of a squid, and the tears of a swan, I mix within the chalice to create a potion, an offering, and a symbol of loyalty, proving my worthiness of your presence.

Upon the infernal tablet, I inscribe the sacred formula below your sigil, adding potency to the summoning, and opening the infernal gateway to welcome you, oh mighty Asmodeus:

"Ol Rama'ach vach, terashim ol Peorj avage secore Asmodeus, Ama."

Raising the ceremonial dagger, I call upon the four cardinal directions, the elemental powers that bind and guide the daimonic currents:

From the East comes the power of Air, to guide your intellect and wit.
From the South comes the power of Fire, to fuel your passion and will.
From the West comes the power of Water, to awaken your wisdom and intuition.
From the North comes the power of Earth, to ground thy essence and authority.

Heed this call, great Asmodeus, and appear as my faithful daemon ally. Grant me prowess in my worldly pursuits, indulge my desires, and unleash the infernal powers of vengeance upon my enemies. In exchange, I offer my unwavering devotion, the rich offerings that lay before you, and the dedication of one who seeks thy knowledge and guidance upon this path.

I complete this invocation in your name, oh mighty Asmodeus, and respectfully request your presence. So it is done, so do I will it, and so shall it be.

Hail, Asmodeus! Hail, dread daemon of passion and cunning! Hail, almighty ruler of revenge and worldly power!
