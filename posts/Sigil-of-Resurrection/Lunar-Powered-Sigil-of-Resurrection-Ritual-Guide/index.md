Procedure to Energize the Sigil of Resurrection using Lunar Cycles:

**Overview**:
The lunar cycles play a significant role in energizing the Sigil of Resurrection. This comprehensive guide will outline the optimal moon phases, essential rituals, and required materials for harnessing the power of the moon to imbue the Sigil with a potent charge. 

1. Optimal Moon Phases:
The moon phases can dramatically affect the potency of the Sigil. The following moon phases are optimal for infusing the Sigil with energy:

   a. New Moon: This phase represents new beginnings and potential. It is a time for setting intentions and planting seeds for future growth. Utilize this phase to initiate the energizing process.
  
   b. Waxing Moon: The moon is growing larger in the sky during this phase. Concentrate on building up the Sigil's internal energy during this time.
  
   c. Full Moon: This phase embodies the peak lunar energy and offers the most potent influence. Harness the power of the full moon to imbue the Sigil with the greatest possible charge.
  
   d. Waning Moon: The moon is decreasing in size during this phase, symbolizing release and letting go. Use this time to dispel any negative energies from the Sigil.

2. Essential Rituals:

   a. Ritual of Intention (New Moon): 
      i. Prepare a sacred space with a clear, uncluttered surface.
      ii. Light a white candle and incense (such as sandalwood or jasmine) to purify the space.
      iii. Place the Sigil on the altar.
      iv. Meditate, focusing on your intention for the Sigil's power and its future purpose.
      v. Verbally state your intention three times while maintaining eye contact with the Sigil.
      vi. Close the ritual by expressing gratitude for the upcoming lunar cycle and the energy it will provide.

   b. Ritual of Empowerment (Waxing Moon):
      i. Light a silver or blue candle and place it beside the Sigil.
      ii. Hold an energizing crystal, such as clear quartz or selenite, in your dominant hand.
      iii. Meditate on the growing energy of both the crystal and the moon, visualizing this energy flowing into the Sigil.
      iv. Repeat this process throughout the waxing phase, adding more crystals to the altar if desired.

   c. Ritual of Charging (Full Moon):
      i. Place the Sigil on a windowsill or outside under direct moonlight.
      ii. Prepare a circle of salt around the Sigil and stand within it.
      iii. Light a white candle and hold it in your dominant hand.
      iv. Declare your intentions, asking the full moon's energy to fully charge the Sigil.
      v. Leave the Sigil exposed to the moonlight for the entire night.

   d. Ritual of Cleansing (Waning Moon):
      i. Ignite a bundle of sage or palo santo and gently pass the Sigil through the smoke.
      ii. While doing this, visualize any negativity being dispelled and replaced with positive intentions.
      iii. Meditate on the process of release and renewal.
      iv. Bury the ashes outside, signifying the disposal of old energy.

3. Required Materials:
   a. Sigil of Resurrection
   b. White and silver/blue candles
   c. Incense (sandalwood or jasmine)
   d. Crystals (clear quartz, selenite, or your preferred energizing crystal)
   e. Salt
   f. Sage or palo santo
   g. Small dish for incense ashes

By following this comprehensive procedure, you will effectively energize the Sigil of Resurrection, harnessing the power of the lunar cycles for a potent charge.
