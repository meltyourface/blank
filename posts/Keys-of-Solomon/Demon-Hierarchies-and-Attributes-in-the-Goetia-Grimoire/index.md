The seventy-two demons of the Goetia are a diverse group of entities, each with its own unique powers, hierarchies, and characteristics. Through a comparative analysis, it becomes apparent that these demons possess specific attributes and responsibilities, which are often interrelated. The possible historical origins and influences behind their descriptions link to various ancient deities, folklore, and mythologies.

The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as the Lemegeton, is a compilation of five texts, the first of which is known as the Goetia. This grimoire provides detailed instructions for summoning and controlling demons through Solomonic magic, focusing primarily on the seventy-two entities mentioned in its pages. These demons are organized hierarchically, with King, Duke, Marquis, Count, and Knight as the primary designations.

Some of the most notable demons from the Goetia include:

1. King Bael, who has the ability to make his conjurer invisible and endowed with knowledge about various subjects. He is associated with the ancient deity Baal, whose original Semitic name means "Lord" or "Master."
2. Duke Agares, who is known for his ability to teach any language and connect to the Earth's energy. Agares shares similarities with the ancient Mesopotamian deity Nergal, the god of the underworld and natural disasters.
3. Marquis Andras, a highly dangerous demon associated with discord and conflict, who shares traits from multiple mythologies, such as the trickster figure in various Native American tales.

When examining the sigils and seals associated with each demon, one can see a central importance placed on geometric symbolism. For instance, King Bael's sigil includes a series of interlocking circles, resembling a labyrinth or maze, which could reflect the elusive nature of the demon.

The Lesser Key of Solomon places great emphasis on the magical items used for summoning and controlling demons. These items include a magical circle, a triangle of conjuration, and a brass vessel containing the sigil of the demon being summoned.

The conjurations employed within the Goetia can be elaborate, involving several prayers, threats, and invocations addressed to the demon. These are often followed by a license to depart, which unbinds the entity and allows it to return to its realm. It is worth noting that while many conjurations follow a similar structure, there can be variations depending on the demon in question.

In conclusion, the seventy-two demons of the Goetia offer a rich tapestry of characteristics, powers, hierarchies, and historical influences. By examining and comparing these entities, one can appreciate the complexity and significance of the Lesser Key of Solomon as a whole. This grimoire has had a profound impact on the practice of western ceremonial magic, shaping the perceptions and understanding of the realm of infernal beings for centuries.
