## Astral Projection through Whare-Ra Esoteric Methods: A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction:

Astral projection is the art of consciously leaving one's physical body to travel in the astral plane. It has been practiced throughout history by various esoteric traditions, including the Whare-Ra group. This guide aims to provide a thorough, step-by-step process for achieving astral projection using the traditional methods of the Whare-Ra group, complete with preparatory exercises, focused meditation practices, and visualization techniques specific to this esoteric tradition. Safety and efficacy are paramount in this journey.

Preparatory Exercises:

1. **Purification ritual**:
A cleansing of the mind and body is essential for engaging in astral projection effectively. To begin, take a ritual bath, incorporating salt, herbs, and oils that align with Whare-Ra practices. Clear your mind of distractions and focus on your intention to connect with the astral plane.

2. **Astral body development**:
Belief in, and connection to, one's astral body is crucial for successful astral projection. Spend time each day visualizing your astral form as a duplicate of your physical body, connected by a silver cord. Familiarize yourself with this form, establishing a strong link.

3. **Energy work and breathing exercises**:
Develop your ability to manipulate your life force energy by practicing breathing exercises such as pranayama or qigong. Focus on directing energy toward your astral body and up the spine towards the crown of your head.

Focused Meditation Practices:

1. **Grounding and centering**:
Begin by grounding and centering yourself: sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take deep breaths, feeling your connection to the Earth. Expand your awareness to encompass your surroundings, recognizing your place at the intersection of the physical and astral realms.

2. **Altered state of consciousness**:
To access the astral plane, one must enter an altered state of consciousness. Use techniques such as repetitive chanting, drumming, or deep meditation to enter this state, maintaining focus on your intention to astral project.

Visualization Techniques:

1. **Astral door**:
Visualize a door or portal in front of you, one that represents your connection to the astral plane. Allow it to take on a form that resonates with the Whare-Ra tradition, such as a golden sun, moon, or tree.

2. **Astral vehicle**:
Now, visualize your astral body entering the astral vehicle, a sacred object or creature associated with the Whare-Ra tradition such as a chariot drawn by horses or seated upon a throne. As your astral self is enveloped within the vehicle, feel the sense of leaving the physical world behind.

3. **Astral travel**:
With your astral body securely within the vehicle, let it ascend, traversing the astral plane. Keep in mind that the silver cord, connecting your astral and physical bodies, will keep you safe and tethered during your journey.

Returning Safely:

1. **Retracing the path**:
When it's time to return, recall the steps you took to reach the astral plane. Retrace the path, visualizing your return.

2. **Reintegration**:
Gently guide your astral form back into your physical body, feeling each part rejoin until you're entirely whole once more.

3. **Grounding**:
Lastly, ground yourself by focusing on the connection between your physical body and the Earth. Allow your consciousness to return fully to the physical plane as you become aware of your surroundings.

Conclusion:

By following these steps and maintaining a strong connection to the Whare-Ra esoteric tradition, one can experience the wonders of astral projection safely and effectively. Remember that mastery may take practice. As your skills progress, you'll find your connection to the astral plane deepens, further enriching your understanding of the vast unseen dimensions that await us.
