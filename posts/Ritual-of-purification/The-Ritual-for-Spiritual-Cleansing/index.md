The Ritual of Pure Ascension:
**Step 1**: Preparing the Space
Select an ideal location outdoors, where you are in direct contact with the earth. This could be a quiet, serene spot in a garden, forest, or any natural setting. Perform the ritual during twilight or dawn when nature's energies are at their peak.
**Step 2**: Drawing a Sacred Circle
With a natural wooden stick, draw a circle of approximately 6 feet in diameter in the chosen location. 
**Step 3**: Invoking Protective Spirits
Begin by addressing protective spirits, guardian angels, or divine energies, asking for strength and protection throughout the ritual.
**Step 4**: Lighting Ritual Incense
Light sandalwood or cedar incense sticks and place them just outside the sacred circle to ward off negative energies.
**Step 5**: Entering the Sacred Circle
Enter the circle and sit cross-legged with a straight spine in the center. Close your eyes, take several deep breaths, and begin to mentally release any negativity or stress.
**Step 6**: Spraying the Natural Cleansing Elixir
Shake the bottle containing the bespoke blend of essential oils and pure water. Spray the elixir generously over your body, starting with the top of your head and moving downward, visualizing the cleansing spray absorbing and dispelling all negative energies.
**Step 7**: Sacred Chanting
While in a meditative state, chant the following sacred mantra nine times: "Ananda-rahasyanubhuti-svarupa." This chant invokes inner joy, spiritual awakening, and self-purification.
**Step 8**: Symbolic Gestures
Perform the ancient mudra known as the "Kshepana Mudra" by interlocking all fingers together, releasing only the index fingers to point outward and downward. This mudra symbolizes the expulsion of negativity and purification of the spirit.
**Step 9**: Final Cleansing
Take another deep breath and visualize a brilliant white light enveloping your entire body, further purifying your mind, body, and spirit. Spray another round of the natural cleansing elixir above your head and let it cascade over your body to finalize the purification process.
**Step 10**: Closing the Sacred Circle
Thank the divine energies, angels, and protective spirits for their assistance. Gather the incense sticks and exit the circle, allowing the positive energies of the ritual to remain with you throughout your day.

This comprehensive ritual of purification, invoking the divine energies and utilizing the bespoke blend of natural cleansing spray, will ensure a holistic and thorough purification of your mind, body, and spirit, leaving you feeling renewed, rejuvenated, and spiritually uplifted.
