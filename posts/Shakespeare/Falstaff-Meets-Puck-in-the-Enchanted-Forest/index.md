## A Knot of Midsummer's Henriad Dreams

Act III, Scene II - An Enchanted Forest in the Realm of the Henriad

[Enter Sir John FALSTAFF, lost and weary]

FALSTAFF:
A pox upon this labyrinth of trees!
Nay, my forest of misfortune it'd be!
Inside this dense and darksome expanse,
A rotund knight shall find no sweet romance.

[Enter PUCK, naturally mischievous]

PUCK:
And what lost soul with plump girth do I see?
Why, 'tis a man most suited for glee!
Fear not, good sir, amid these trees and vines,
I offer service, if thou art inclined.

FALSTAFF:
Mysterious specter, stay thy jest,
For I am weary, seeking peace and rest.
But shouldst thou guide me to a safe repose,
I would trust thee, despite my many woes.

PUCK:
Ah, well-met knight, I shall lead the way
To a realm wherein thy cares in respite lay.
But first, lay coin upon yon hollow log,
So might my service worthy prove and strong.

[FALSTAFF hesitates, then places the coin on the log]

FALSTAFF:
Thy task complete, now show me restful shade,
Though I know not if I am bless'd or play'd.

PUCK:
Not in the art of trickery shall I engage,
But mischief's warmth hath drawn me to this stage.
Thy wit and mine, a dance shall we commence,
E'er I guide thee to thy fair recompense.

FALSTAFF:
Indeed, I bite, curious elf, I say!
Our sharp-tongued duel from winds, strays.
Begin then, thou strange impish knave,
Show me thy talent for a cunning rave.

PUCK [smirking]:
Knight so wide, like an oak thou stands,
Couldst thou, perhaps, escape the Robin's hand?
Thy limbs so full and rife with stocked brawn,
Wouldst thou wend a maid or gentle faun?

FALSTAFF:
Ha! Yet thou hast not reckon'd my charm,
Which lures tender hearts to mine ample arm.
No wood be I, neither beast nor fish,
But the Falstaff, who sates all earthly wish.

PUCK [intrigued]:
A proffer then, a bargain I'll propose,
In this dreamt forest your wit will disclose.
A hornéd king, in midsummer well-known,
He yearns to taste of wit thou has sown.

FALSTAFF [determined]:
Through this mystical and murky night,
I'll meet this hornèd king, by Puck's light.
Show me the path, you nimble sprite of air,
Let Falstaff's humor reign upon his lair.

PUCK:
That be the spirit, heavy-laden sir,
One laugh or two, be payment well incurred.
Henceforth, we journey, may the revels start,
By wit engaged, in Shakespeare's dual art.

[Exeunt]
