To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, let us first break down the key terms and concepts involved. These include Carl Jung's "shadow self," alchemy, and the Hermetic principles. By examining each of these concepts, we can better understand how they can be combined to help us empathize with and comprehend a criminal's mindset.

1. **Carl Jung's Shadow Self**: Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung proposed the idea of the "shadow self." According to Jung, the shadow self is an unconscious part of a person's personality that comprises all their repressed, unexpressed, and disowned aspects. These traits are ones that an individual fails to recognize or acknowledge, and they often manifest as destructive behaviors. By understanding one's shadow, we can potentially comprehend the roots of criminal behavior, as many of these traits could lead to antisocial actions.

2. **Alchemy**: Alchemy is an ancient philosophical and protoscientific practice that aims to transform one substance into another, change base metals into noble metals (like gold), and discover a universal elixir that may grant immortality. Symbolically, alchemy represents a process of personal transformation, self-discovery, and enlightenment.

3. **Hermetic Principles**: Hermetic principles are derived from the ancient teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who is considered to be the father of Western occultism. His teachings have been combined into a set of seven principles, collectively known as the Hermetic philosophy. The principles are mentalism, correspondence, vibration, polarity, rhythm, cause and effect, and gender, which describe fundamental laws of nature and the human experience.

Now that we've defined these concepts, we can delve into how they can be utilized to understand and empathize with a criminal's mindset.

In the process of empathy and understanding a criminal, one should first examine their shadow self. By acknowledging and exploring these repressed aspects of an individual's personality, we may uncover the origins of criminal actions and gain insight into the motivations behind the behavior. Additionally, recognizing one's shadow can provide a path to personal growth and, possibly, to lessen the severity of criminal behavior over time.

On the other hand, alchemy offers symbolic representations of transformation and self-discovery. In the context of understanding a criminal's mindset, we can see that by engaging in a process similar to alchemy – breaking down and examining the fundamental elements of their personality, emotions, and behavior – an individual may undergo personal transformation. This transformation could eventually lead to a better understanding of their actions and a shift towards a more positive and beneficial direction in life.

The Hermetic principles, as universal laws of nature, provide a framework for understanding the more profound aspects of the criminal mind. Mentalism (the belief that all is mind) suggests that a person's reality is shaped by their thoughts and inner feelings; this may help us understand how negative thoughts and deep-rooted beliefs contribute to criminal behavior. By applying the principles of correspondence and vibration (that everything in the world is interconnected and continuously moving), we can study how various experiences, relationships, and influences contribute to the development of criminal tendencies.

Furthermore, the principles of polarity and rhythm help us grasp the idea that life consists of opposites and cycles. Criminal behavior may represent the darker, negative side of human nature, but with time and personal growth, there is potential for change and finding balance.

To conclude, empathizing with and understanding a criminal's mindset can be achieved by combining Carl Jung's concept of the shadow self, the symbolism in the practice of alchemy, and the Hermetic principles. Understanding the shadow self allows us to realize and accept our repressed aspects, leading to personal growth and the possibility of change. The symbolism of alchemy represents transformation and the process of self-discovery, which can provide criminal individuals with a path towards better understanding themselves and their actions. Finally, the Hermetic principles give us a universal framework to recognize the forces at play that shape an individual's mindset and behavior, allowing us to grasp the roots of criminal conduct.
