## Cycle of Souls

### I. Overview

Cycle of Souls is a fictional universe deeply rooted in the concepts and nuances of Reincarnation. This world is governed by spiritual and metaphysical systems that dictate the rebirth cycle, the progression of souls, karmic ties, and cosmic consequences. Various cultures and beliefs shape the social, political, and religious landscape of this world, each interpreting Reincarnation uniquely. The rich storytelling possibilities intertwine within this intricate narrative, ultimately leading to profound character development and exciting plotlines.

### II. Spiritual and Metaphysical Systems

A. The Rebirth Cycle

The rebirth cycle begins with the Basin of Souls, an eternal, divine fountain within the center of the universe. When a life ends, their soul returns to the Basin of Souls, blending with countless others to create an ethereal essence. These souls are then redistributed through the cosmic Nine Wheels, each determining their new incarnation based on karmic connections. This cycle continues indefinitely, defying the concepts of linear time.

B. Soul Progression

As souls continue to reincarnate, they evolve through the five tiers of spiritual enlightenment: Mortem, Sapientia, Lumina, Transcendens, and Aeternitas. Each tier's progress signifies an increasing understanding of life, karma, and cosmic connection. Souls carry memories of their past lives within their essence, influencing their decisions and character throughout all future incarnations.

C. Karmic Ties

Upon reincarnation, each soul maintains karmic ties to those they have encountered in previous lives. Karmic relationships allow for opportunities of growth and redemption, playing an essential role in the universe's harmony and balance. Unresolved karmic debts manifest as challenges or conflict, shaping the soul's life experiences and connections.

D. Cosmic Consequences

In response to moral choices and actions that disrupt the cosmic balance, souls can experience various cosmic blessings, conflicts, or penalties. Higher powers, known as the Ascendi, intervene where necessary, guiding or admonishing souls in their cosmic journey.

### III. Cultures, Beliefs, and Rituals

A. The Luminites

The Luminites are a culture of light-wielders dedicated to aiding souls in their quest for advancement. Their beliefs revolve around the sacred duty of preserving cosmic harmony. The Luminites practice funeral rites that involve sending the souls of the departed through a light portal to the Basin of Souls.

B. The Children of the Basin

The Children of the Basin inhabit the lands surrounding the Basin of Souls. They believe in harnessing the power of the Basin, interpreting Reincarnation as a unifying life force. Their rituals include cleansing and blessing ceremonies performed in the Basin's waters, seeking to purify karmic ties.

C. The Nexus Guardians

The Nexus Guardians dwell within the nine realms interconnected by the cosmic Nine Wheels. They are an eclectic culture, merging the beliefs and practices of various societies. Their primary purpose is to protect and maintain the balance of the cosmic Nine Wheels, providing a sense of stability to the world they oversee.

### IV. Character Experiences and Karmic Impact

A. Elara Del'Vandross

In her current life, Elara is a renowned healer from the Luminites, known for her ability to mend the broken ties of the soul. Unbeknownst to her, she was once a feared scourge of the universe who crossed paths with numerous souls she now heals. Her past actions drive Elara's present dedication to making amends and helping others.
