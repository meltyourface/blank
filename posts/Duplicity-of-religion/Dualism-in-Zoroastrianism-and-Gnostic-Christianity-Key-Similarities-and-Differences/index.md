In order to provide an in-depth response to this knowledge challenge, let us first establish a clear understanding of the key terms and concepts involved. Dualism is a concept that explains the nature of reality through two opposing principles, often representing good and evil or light and darkness amongst other polarities. Duplicity, in this context, refers to the presence and function of dualistic concepts within religious systems.

Now that we have defined the critical concepts in this challenge, we will discuss the dualism within two religious systems, namely Zoroastrianism and Gnostic Christianity, and explore their differences, similarities, and implications concerning the understanding of duplicity within these beliefs.

Zoroastrianism is an ancient Persian religious system that has a strong dualistic foundation. Its central tenet revolves around the cosmic struggle between Ahura Mazda, the supreme God who represents wisdom, light, and truth, and Angra Mainyu, an opposing and destructive force that embodies darkness, chaos, and evil. Followers of Zoroastrianism believe that human beings have a crucial role in this cosmic struggle. They are expected to choose the side of good by practicing moral virtues and upholding truth, thereby contributing to the ultimate victory of Ahura Mazda.

Gnostic Christianity, on the other hand, is a branch of early Christianity that emphasizes the role of knowledge or 'gnosis' in attaining salvation. Gnostic Christians embrace a dualistic view of reality, wherein the material world is viewed as a fallen creation that is ruled by a lower, malevolent being, often referred to as the Demiurge. In contrast, a higher, transcendent God represents spiritual light, knowledge, and truth. Gnostics believe that humankind possesses a divine spark originating from the spiritual realm, which must be discovered and nurtured through secret knowledge and experiences, eventually leading to spiritual liberation.

With this contextual understanding of the dualism present within Zoroastrianism and Gnostic Christianity, let us now delve into their similarities and differences.

**Similarities**:
1. Both belief systems feature a cosmic struggle between the opposing forces of light and darkness, good and evil.
2. In both cases, the followers have a responsibility to align themselves with the forces of good and to actively participate in overcoming evil.
3. Both religions believe that the material world, although affected by evil, has a higher purpose, either as an arena for moral growth (Zoroastrianism) or as a place to discover and awaken inner spiritual knowledge (Gnostic Christianity).

**Differences**:
1. While Zoroastrianism sees Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu in a direct conflict, Gnostic Christianity perceives the struggle as occurring between the material world governed by the Demiurge and the spiritual realm of the higher God.
2. Zoroastrianism's dualism is more concrete and cosmic, while Gnostic Christianity's dualism is primarily focused on the spiritual journey of an individual.
3. Salvation in Zoroastrianism is attained through following a moral and ethical path, while Gnostic Christianity emphasizes the acquisition of secret knowledge to return to the spiritual realm.

These comparisons of dualism within Zoroastrianism and Gnostic Christianity lead to several implications concerning the overall understanding of duplicity within religious systems.

1. Dualism serves as a framework for humans to interpret and comprehend the complexities of the world in both religious belief systems. The presence of light and dark, good and evil, offers a way to explain the moral challenges and spiritual questions that humans face.
2. The dualistic approach of these religions highlights the interplay between individual choice and cosmic forces, signifying that individuals have agency in determining the outcome of the cosmic struggle.
3. Both systems emphasize the importance of transcending the confines of the material world by aligning oneself with the higher power or force, which bears an existential significance for followers of these religious systems.

In conclusion, the dualism present within both Zoroastrianism and Gnostic Christianity illustrates the power and significance of contrasting forces in religious understanding. Despite their differences in approach and emphasis, both systems highlight the human role in overcoming evil and darkness and ultimately striving towards a more enlightened and transcendent state.
