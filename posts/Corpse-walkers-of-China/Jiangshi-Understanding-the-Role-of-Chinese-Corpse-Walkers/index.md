The role of corpse walkers, also known as "jiangshi" (僵尸) or "stiff corpse," in Chinese folklore is deeply rooted in the historical, social, and metaphysical contexts of Chinese culture. The concept of the corpse walker emerged from a combination of diverse beliefs and practices that sought to explain and address the challenges surrounding death, burial, and afterlife in Chinese society. To fully appreciate the role of corpse walkers in Chinese folklore, it is important to explore their historical evolution, the social contexts in which they functioned, and their metaphysical significance. Furthermore, by examining their relevance in both traditional Taoist practices and modern Chinese society, we can trace the enduring influence of these supernatural beings.

Historical Context:

The concept of corpse walkers dates back to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-256 BCE), where texts like "Zuo Zhuan" (左传) mentioned the existence of undead creatures. However, the term "jiangshi" gained prominence during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). Corpse walkers can be seen as a reflection of the society's fears and uncertainties, especially considering the widespread poverty, frequent wars, and natural disasters that characterized different periods of Chinese history. Given that corpse walkers were believed to bring bad luck, disease, and death, their representation in folktales and myths served as cautionary tales, urging people to follow social rules, respect the dead, and be aware of the spiritual world.

Social Context:

The role of corpse walkers in Chinese folklore is closely linked to the customs surrounding death and burial. In traditional Chinese society, returning a deceased person's body to their hometown for burial was crucial, as it allowed the soul to find peace and join their ancestors in the afterlife. However, transporting corpses across long distances was expensive and time-consuming, a challenge that gave rise to the practice of "xing shi" (行尸), or "walking" the dead with the help of corpse walkers.

The corpse walkers would be hired to shepherd the dead person's body to its final resting place. In some versions of the folklore, this was accomplished through a Taoist priest or necromancer who would affix a supernatural talisman to the corpse, enabling it to walk or hop on its own. Alternatively, corpse walkers would work in pairs, carrying the corpse suspended between them, with the apparent "hopping" motion of the body creating the illusion of it walking. In both cases, the corpse walker served an essential social function by facilitating the process of returning the deceased to their ancestral lands.

Metaphysical Context:

Corpse walkers also played an important role in the metaphysical world of Chinese folklore. They were often associated with the Taoist concept of "qi" (氣), the vital life force energy that flows through all living beings. Corpse walkers were thought to possess an imbalance of qi, causing their lifeless bodies to remain animated after death. This spiritual aspect of corpse walkers was reinforced by the talismans used to control them, which were typically inscribed with sacred scriptures.

Relevance in Traditional Taoist Practices:

Taoist practices surrounding death, burial, and the afterlife often featured corpse walkers. Besides playing a role in the transportation of bodies, they represented the importance of maintaining proper qi flow to resist malevolent supernatural entities and achieve balance in one's life. Taoist exorcists or priests were believed to possess the power to control and banish jiangshi, further highlighting the importance of spiritual knowledge and practice in managing the forces of life and death.

Modern Chinese Society:

The concept of corpse walkers has remained relevant in modern Chinese society, both as cultural relics and as cautionary tales. While the practice of "walking" the dead has diminished significantly, stories of jiangshi continue to exist in literature, movies, and television shows, such as classic Hong Kong films like "Mr. Vampire" (僵尸先生) and the more recent Chinese television series "The Untamed" (陈情令). Jiangshi thereby serves as a reflection of the enduring influence of Chinese folklore on contemporary culture and as a reminder of the importance of respecting tradition and maintaining a harmonious balance between life and death.

In summary, the role of corpse walkers in Chinese folklore is deeply entrenched in historical, social, and metaphysical contexts, serving essential functions in traditional Chinese society. Their relevance in Taoist practices and contemporary Chinese culture attests to the enduring influence of these supernatural beings, reminding us to honor our ancestors and maintain balance in the spiritual world.
