The Corpse Walkers of China: History, Mythology, and Practice

Introduction to Corpse Walking

Corpse walking, known in Chinese as "Xiangshi Gong," is an ancient and esoteric practice in which a skilled practitioner manipulates the corpse of a deceased person, moving it along as if it were walking. This ritualistic form of transportation played a significant role in Chinese culture, particularly in remote and mountainous regions, where the dead were returned to their ancestral homes for burial. Studying corpse walking traditions enriches our understanding of Chinese folklore, superstitions, and the occult.

History and Cultural Significance

The history of corpse walking dates back to the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 CE). With the spread of ancestor worship and the importance of proper burial rites in Chinese culture, the demand for transporting corpses emerged. During this time, professional corpse walkers or "Ganshi Masters," undertook the task of moving the deceased to ensure they reached their final resting place, allowing their spirits to find peace.

Due to the mountainous terrain and poor infrastructure in ancient China, transportation of corpses was costly and risky. However, the deep-rooted belief in carrying out one's filial duties and the fear of suffering spiritual repercussions compelled families to engage Ganshi Masters. Corpse walking became an integral aspect of funerary customs, particularly in the Sichuan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces.

Mythology and Folklore

Corpse walking practices are tightly woven into the fabric of Chinese mythology and folklore. The rituals are often linked to supernatural beings, such as corpse-walking demons known as jiangshi, and the sly fox spirits, hu li jing, who are believed to animate the dead for nefarious purposes.

The mythology surrounding corpse walking underscores the intermediary role of Ganshi Masters, who not only transport the dead physically but spiritually. They are able to converse and negotiate with spirits, using their esoteric knowledge to protect the families of the deceased and ensure the safe repose of their ancestors.

Techniques and Practices

Ganshi Masters possess extensive knowledge in various esoteric arts, including Taoist spiritual practices, alchemy, and martial arts, which they utilize to manipulate the corpses. There are several methods of corpse walking, including the "hook and rope" (ku xian fa), "wind and wood" (feng mu fa), and "paper effigies" (ji xiang fa) methods.

1. Hook and Rope Method: This technique involves attaching specially crafted hooks to the corpse's limbs, connecting them via a network of ropes. The Ganshi Master manipulates the ropes in such a way that the corpse appears to walk.

2. Wind and Wood Method: In this method, the Ganshi Master uses his esoteric skills to summon the energies of nature, causing the elements to propel the corpse forward. Bamboo poles are often used to help control and balance the corpse's movements.

3. Paper Effigies Method: Employing curse tablets and paper talismans adorned with magical inscriptions, the Ganshi Master summons spirit helpers who animate the corpse, making it ambulate.

Role in the Occult and Chinese Society

Corpse walking traditions and techniques have influenced various aspects of Chinese occult practices, including sorcery, divination, and geomancy. Artifacts associated with corpse walking, such as talismans and curse tablets, have been discovered throughout China, demonstrating the pervasive nature of these beliefs.

Though today these practices have largely disappeared from mainstream culture, corpse walking persists in remote corners of China, revered as a testament to the nation's rich cultural heritage and esoteric traditions. Modern students of the occult can draw inspiration and knowledge from the ancient wisdom of the Ganshi Masters, uncovering new insights into the macabre and mysterious world of corpse walking.
