## Journey into the Realms of Esoteric Occultism with Jake Stratton-Kent

Begin by finding a quiet and comfortable space where you will not be disturbed. Sit or lie down in a restful position.

Take a few moments to relax your body. Start by focusing on your breath. Slowly inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Inhale deeply and fully, pulling positive energy into your body, and exhale completely, releasing any tension or negative energy you might be holding onto.

As you continue breathing, visualize a glowing golden light radiating from your heart and expanding to envelop your entire being. Feel this warm and protective light around you, creating a protective barrier against any negative energies.

Now, begin to ground yourself in the world of Jake Stratton-Kent, entering the realm of esoteric occultism. Visualize yourself entering a vast library, filled with ancient texts and mystical symbols. You are here to explore the realms of Goetic magic, necromancy, and the teachings from the Geosophia, True Grimoire, and Testament of Cyprian the Mage.

As you traverse this expansive library, you come across the Geosophia, a monumental work discussing the roots of goetic magic. Imagine yourself holding this powerful tome in your hands, feeling the energy and knowledge contained within its pages.

Open the book and delve into Stratton-Kent's exploration of the spirits of geomancy, the sixteen geomantic figures, each related to a specific spirit. Focus on the figure of Acquisitio and let your mind absorb the intricacies of its form.

In your mind's eye, visualize the shape of Acquisitio, and, with your finger, trace the figure on the palm of your hand. Feel the energy of the guiding spirit resonating within you, allowing you to move deeper into the realm of esoteric knowledge.

Slowly walk deeper into the library, drawn to the mysterious True Grimoire. As you scan its pages, you learn about the importance of ritual in goetic magic, specifically the art of effectively summoning and commanding spirits. You are introduced to the intricate tools used for ceremonial magic, including the Pentacle of Solomon and the Seal of God - the Sigillum Dei Aemeth.

Now, visualize yourself seated in a sacred ritual space. Before you are the components of the Goetic Circle and Triangle, integral to the summoning process. You focus on the preparation and performance laid out within the pages of the True Grimoire, feeling the power within your being as you enter into a trance-like state, reaching out to commune with the spiritual world.

Continue to venture through the library of occult knowledge until you stumble upon the Testament of Cyprian the Mage. You discover the importance of necromancy, the art of speaking with spirits and the deceased for knowledge, understanding, and growth.

Guided by Stratton-Kent's words, you find yourself walking through a dark and shadowy forest where you are led to a secluded graveyard. The idea of communicating with the spirits fills you with curiosity and determination. 

In this space, imagine yourself conducting a necromantic ritual, opening up the doorway between the living and the dead. As you chant the ancient words and perform the necessary actions, you finally feel a connection with the spirits that dwell beyond the veil.

Take a moment to ask these spirits for guidance or advice on your spiritual journey. Listen to their whispered wisdom, taking time to absorb the lessons they have to offer.

As your encounter concludes, thank the spirits for their communication and bid them farewell. Walk away from the graveyard, carrying newfound knowledge and spiritual growth with you.

With the guided journey through Stratton-Kent's landscape coming to an end, it's time to return to your physical surroundings. Feel the warmth of the golden light that remains within and around you.

Begin to notice your surroundings and take a deep breath. When you are ready, open your eyes, finding yourself back in your space, profoundly affected by this exploration of esoteric occultism, Goetic magic, and necromancy.

Carry the wisdom and growth with you as you continue your journey in the world, integrating the teachings of Jake Stratton-Kent into your life as you delve further into his mysteries.
