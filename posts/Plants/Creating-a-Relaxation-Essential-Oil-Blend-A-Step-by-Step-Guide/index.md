excerpt: Formulate an essential oil blend for relaxation by combining the therapeutic properties of oils extracted from three distinct plant species, specifically Lavandula angustifolia (lavender), Matricaria chamomilla (chamomile), and Citrus sinensis
  (sweet orange). Experiment with varying ratios to optimize the synergy of their soothing and calming effects, keeping in mind the appropriate dilution rates and safety considerations of each. Conduct olfactory and dermal tests to evaluate and refine the resulting blends for efficacy and comfort.

To create an essential oil blend for relaxation using Lavandula angustifolia (lavender), Matricaria chamomilla (chamomile), and Citrus sinensis (sweet orange), follow these steps:

1. Research the therapeutic properties of each oil:

- Lavender: Lavandula angustifolia is known for its calming and soothing effects, helping to relieve stress and promote sleep. The recommended dilution rate is 1-5%.
- Chamomile: Matricaria chamomilla is known for its anti-inflammatory and calming effects. It helps with anxiety, stress, and skin irritations. The recommended dilution rate is 1-2%.
- Sweet Orange: Citrus sinensis has uplifting and invigorating properties, easing anxiety and enhancing mood. It can act as a mild sedative and help combat insomnia. The recommended dilution rate is 1-5%.

2. Create the initial essential oil blend:

- Begin by combining equal parts (e.g., drops or milliliters) of each essential oil in a small, dark-colored glass bottle with a dropper. This would mean approximately 33.3% of each oil. 

3. Experiment with varying ratios:

- You may need to adjust these ratios to achieve the desired synergy. Start by using 40% lavender, 30% chamomile, and 30% sweet orange for a more soothing and calming effect. Should you wish to enhance the uplifting and mood-boosting effects, consider a ratio of 30% lavender, 20% chamomile, and 50% sweet orange.
- You may need to create several experimental blends to discover the most effective ratio for your needs.

4. Create the carrier oil blend:

To use the blend safely on the skin, it is vital to dilute the essential oils in a carrier oil. A 2% dilution rate is generally considered safe for adults. 

- To achieve a 2% dilution, mix 12 drops of the essential oil blend per 30ml (about 1 ounce) of carrier oil, such as coconut oil, sweet almond oil, or jojoba oil.

5. Conduct olfactory and dermal tests:

- Test the fragrance of each blend by inhaling it deeply and assessing if it promotes relaxation and if it is pleasing. Make note of your observations.
- For dermal testing, apply a small amount of the diluted blend to a small, patch of skin (preferably on the inside of your forearm). Wait for 48 hours to make sure there are no adverse reactions or irritations. If there are no issues after conducting the patch test, you may proceed with using the blend on your skin.

6. Evaluate and refine the blends:

Based on the olfactory and dermal tests, adjust the ratios of essential oils, if needed, until you find the perfect blend for relaxation. This may take some experimentation, but the result will be a personalized, synergistic essential oil blend that provides the ideal soothing and calming effects.
