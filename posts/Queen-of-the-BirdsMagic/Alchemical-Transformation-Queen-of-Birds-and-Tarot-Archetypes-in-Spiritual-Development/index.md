To thoroughly address the knowledge challenge, we must first break down the components of the question into three key elements: the mythological Queen of the Birds, the alchemical process of transformation, and the Tarot Major Arcana cards. We will investigate the symbolic parallels and mystical connections between these three elements by analyzing their imagery, motifs, and meanings in order to derive a comprehensive esoteric and occult understanding.

### I. Mythological Queen of the Birds:

The Queen of the Birds is a mythical figure believed to preside over the diverse realm of avian creatures. Symbolically, the Queen represents sovereignty, flight, and the ability to traverse different realms, transcending earthly limitations. In this capacity, the Queen symbolizes spiritual wisdom, freedom, and mastery over one's inner nature.

In certain traditions, such as the Sufi mystical tradition, the Queen of the Birds is known as the Simurgh, an extraordinary bird said to inhabit the Tree of Life, serving as a guardian of wisdom and harbinger of profound transformation.

### II. The Alchemical Process of Transformation:

Alchemy is an ancient practice that is often referred to as the precursor of modern chemistry. In broad terms, alchemy is an art and science that seeks to achieve the transmutation of base metals into gold or the search for the philosopher's stone, leading to immortality. Beyond the physical realm, alchemy symbolizes the subtle and profound process of personal transformation, seeking to transmute the base aspects of one's personality and consciousness towards a more spiritually refined state.

Central to the alchemical process are three primary stages:

1. Nigredo: The blackening or decomposition phase, symbolizing the breaking down of old, impure forms and the confrontation of one's shadow or darker aspects.

2. Albedo: The whitening or purification phase, representing the cleansing and purging of the remnants of the old forms, leading to renewal, illumination, and the integration of newfound wisdom.

3. Rubedo: The reddening or unification phase, signifying the final integration and synthesis of the two prior stages, culminating in the manifestation of the philosopher's stone or the ultimate state of spiritual enlightenment and unity with the divine.

### III. Tarot Major Arcana Cards:

The Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, 22 of which belong to the Major Arcana and represent archetypal symbols and energies that mirror the progression of spiritual development and personal growth. When exploring the connections between the Queen of the Birds, the alchemical process, and the Tarot, we can focus on a specific subset of Major Arcana cards that exemplify the aspects of spiritual wisdom, transformation, and the quest for mastery.

1. The Fool: The Fool, numbered 0 or sometimes placed at the end of the Major Arcana, represents the uninhibited spirit of the individual embarking on a new spiritual journey. The Fool's carefree demeanor and willingness to listen to intuitive guidance align with the Queen of the Birds' ability to traverse realms and embody freedom.

2. The Hanged Man: This card bears the image of a figure suspended upside down, symbolizing the act of surrendering one's old perspective and embracing a new, transformed view of reality. This stage resonates with both the alchemical process of Nigredo (breaking down old forms) and the Queen of the Birds' spiritual wisdom.

3. The Tower: The Tower signifies sudden upheaval, an explosive release of built-up energy, leading to the dismantling of long-standing beliefs, structures, and patterns. This card resonates with the phases of Nigredo and Albedo in the alchemical process of transformation.

4. Death: As the harbinger of transformation, Death denotes the end of a cycle and is closely associated with the Nigredo stage of alchemy. The card symbolizes the necessary process of release and regeneration, paving the way for the spiritual metamorphosis and wisdom overseen by the Queen of the Birds.

5. Temperance: Temperance depicts the process of purification and healing, with themes of balance, harmony, and synthesis. This card embodies the spirit of the Albedo phase in alchemy and the Queen of the Birds' mastery over one's inner nature.

6. The World: The final card in the Major Arcana, the World, symbolizes the culmination of the spiritual journey, embodying the highest level of unity, wholeness, and mastery. This card aligns with the Rubedo phase of alchemy and the Queen of the Birds' wisdom, representing the successful attainment of spiritual enlightenment and the actualization of one's divine nature.

In summary, the symbolic parallels and mystical connections between the mythological Queen of the Birds, the alchemical process of transformation, and the Tarot Major Arcana cards can be found in their shared themes of wisdom, initiation, transformation, and mastery. By understanding these elements from an esoteric and occult perspective, one gains comprehensive insight into the interwoven tapestry of human potential and spiritual developmentâ€”a living testament to the power and significance of these ancient symbols and their interrelated wisdom.
