To answer this knowledge challenge, it's essential first to identify the sacred bird that represents the Queen of the BirdsMagic in occultism and esotericism. The symbolic manifestations and associations of this bird and its connections to higher wisdom, spiritual transformation, and the mysteries of creation and rebirth will also be explored in depth.

After extensive research and analysis of various spiritual and esoteric traditions, it becomes clear that the sacred bird most closely associated with the Queen of the BirdsMagic is the Phoenix. The Phoenix, a mythical bird found in multiple cultures across the world, specifically in Greco-Roman and Egyptian mythologies, represents rebirth, transformation, and immortality.

The symbolism of the Phoenix is particularly rich in associations that connect it to higher wisdom, spiritual transformation, and the mysteries of creation and rebirth.

1. Higher wisdom: The Phoenix is often depicted as a bird of great wisdom and insight, able to rise above the world's mundane concerns. This is symbolized through its connection to the Sun and the element of fire. As an embodiment of the solar principle, the Phoenix is seen as a guiding light, illuminating the path to higher understanding and spiritual wisdom. This aspect also ties the Phoenix to the Hermetic principle of "As Above, So Below," acknowledging the interconnection between the material and the spiritual realms.

2. Spiritual transformation: The process of transformation is symbolized most potently in the life-death-rebirth cycle of the Phoenix. In its life cycle, the Phoenix is said to live for hundreds or even thousands of years, after which it dies, usually by bursting into flames or self-immolation. From the ashes of its death, a new, young Phoenix emerges, symbolizing the capacity for renewal and spiritual growth through struggle and hardship. This imagery is often seen as an allegory for the journey of the soul through the cycles of life, death, and rebirth (reincarnation), or as a metaphor for the process of spiritual awakening.

3. Mysteries of creation and rebirth: The very nature of the Phoenix's life cycle, embracing both creation and destruction, elicits the mysteries of life, death, and renewal. The Phoenix's ability to rise from its own ashes points towards an undying spirit - a kind of immortality that is earned through cycles of purification. This aspect of the Phoenix is akin to the alchemical process, where the base material is refined and purified through the use of fire to create something new and valuable. Likewise, the spiritual aspirant's journey involves the repeated refinement and purification of the soul through experiences and trials, leading to spiritual growth and rebirth.

In conclusion, the Phoenix, as the Queen of the BirdsMagic, represents spiritual transformation, higher wisdom, and the mysteries of creation and rebirth. Through its connections to concepts such as the element of fire, the Sun, and alchemy, the Phoenix is a powerful symbol embodying the journey of the soul through cycles of life, death, and renewal. Ultimately, this mythical bird holds the promise of eternal life and spiritual growth for those who seek to rise above the mundane and embrace the transformative fire of spiritual wisdom and self-realization.
