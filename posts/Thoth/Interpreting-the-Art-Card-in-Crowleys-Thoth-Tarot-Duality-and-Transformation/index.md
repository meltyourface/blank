Aleister Crowley, a prominent figure in the world of the occult and esotericism, was deeply influenced by the ancient Egyptian deity Thoth in the creation of his Thoth Tarot deck. Thoth, the god of wisdom, writing, and magic, was believed to be the mediator between the divine and the mortal realm. Crowley's writings on the Thoth Tarot cards are infused with his understanding of Thoth, ancient Egyptian symbolism, and the practice of magick.

The Art card, originally called Temperance in traditional tarot decks, represents the perfect union and balance between opposites, ultimately leading to transformation. In interpreting this card's relationship to Thoth and Crowley's understanding of the occult, we must first examine the symbolism depicted on the card itself.

The key figure on the Art card is an androgynous figure, representing both male and female energies, wearing a white tunic and golden armor, suggesting purity and power respectively. This figure stands with one foot on the ground, the other on water, symbolizing the ability to balance material and spiritual matters. In its hands, the figure holds two vessels—one pouring liquid onto a bow and arrow and the other pouring it onto a burning sword. The mixture of fire and water, two polar opposites in alchemical symbolism, indicates an alchemical process that results in the creation of something new by merging these contrasting elements.

This concept of duality and balance in the Art card corresponds to Crowley's understanding of Thoth as the force that unites opposites and maintains balance within them. Thoth, as the god of equilibrium, embodies both wisdom and magick, bringing harmony and synthesis between seemingly contradictory forces.

Additionally, the card features a series of symbols that further emphasize both Thoth and the esoteric implications. At the top of the card, the symbol of the sun denotes the divine presence and the idea of enlightenment, which aligns with Thoth's role as the deity of wisdom. The bow and arrow, as well as the sword, signify the force of will to transmute base desires into higher spiritual pursuits, while the lion and eagle represent the alchemical components of sulfur and mercury, hinting at the transformative process that happens when balancing the forces of fire (will) and water (intuition) takes place.

Another vital symbol in the Art card is the sign of infinity, also known as the lemniscate, which appears above the figure's head. This represents the infinite cycle of the universe, the interplay between opposing forces, and the eternal renewal of life — all reintroducing the ideas of universal equilibrium and harmony that Thoth represents.

In conclusion, Crowley's writings on the Art card are deeply rooted in his understanding of the Egyptian deity Thoth and its connection to the principles of duality, balance, and transformation. The symbology within the Art card highlights the esoteric implications of Thoth's wisdom and magic, reinforcing the complexity within Crowley's interpretation of this card in the Thoth Tarot deck. By delving into the intricacies of the Art card, we can better appreciate the layers of meaning and symbolism inspired by Thoth, highlighting Crowley's commitment to depicting the nuances of the occult.
