Answer: All of the above

**Explanation**: The aftermath of a nuclear strike is characterized by a multitude of detrimental effects that impact both the environment and human society. These factors are interconnected and amplify the overall damage caused by the nuclear event. **The primary factors include**:

1. **Radioactive fallout and widespread contamination**: The explosion of a nuclear weapon releases vast amounts of radiation into the atmosphere, which descends as "fallout" particles. These radioactive contaminants can contaminate air, water, soil, and ultimately enter the food chain. Exposure to fallout can cause acute and chronic health issues, such as radiation sickness, cancers, and birth defects.

2. **Social and economic disruption**: A nuclear strike has immediate and long-term consequences for human society. The sudden loss of life, combined with the destruction of social and economic infrastructure, can disrupt the functioning of entire regions and countries. Moreover, the fear of future strikes may lead to political instability and exacerbate international relations.

3. **Displacement and migration of affected populations**: The destruction caused by a nuclear strike is likely to force large numbers of people to leave their homes in search of safety. This displacement will place additional burdens on neighboring countries and regions, leading to further social and economic strains.

4. Climate disruption, such as "nuclear winter" effect: A large-scale nuclear war could cause significant and long-lasting climate disruption. The massive fires and dust clouds produced by nuclear explosions can block sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface, leading to a temporary cooling effect known as "nuclear winter". This cooling could disrupt agricultural production and lead to food shortages across the globe.

5. **Infrastructural damage and loss of resources**: Nuclear strikes can cause widespread and long-lasting damage to critical infrastructure, such as transportation, communication, and energy systems. The repair and rebuilding of these systems will require significant time and resources, further straining an affected society's ability to recover.

These factors combine to create a complex and devastating picture of the long-term effects of a nuclear strike. Understanding the interconnected nature of these consequences is crucial for promoting international cooperation on nuclear disarmament and preventing future catastrophes.
