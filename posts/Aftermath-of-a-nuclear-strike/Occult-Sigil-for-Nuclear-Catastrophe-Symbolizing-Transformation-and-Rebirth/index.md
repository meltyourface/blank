To design an occult sigil that symbolizes the transformative energies unleashed in the aftermath of a nuclear strike, we must first define what an occult sigil is, detail the aspects of a nuclear strike and its aftermath, and then merge these concepts into a coherent and meaningful design. 

An occult sigil is a symbol used in ceremonial magick and esoteric practices. It represents specific energies, intentions, or entities and can be used as a tool to channel and focus an individual's will and desires. Sigils often have complex and intricate designs, derived from various sources like sacred geometry, alchemical symbols or ancient spiritual hieroglyphs. The process of creating a sigil often involves focusing on the intention or desired outcome and letting the subconscious mind generate a unique symbol representing that intention.

The aftermath of a nuclear strike is an event of immense destructive power, both physically and psychologically. The physical implications include widespread radiation, environmental destruction, and the potential for long-term health consequences for surviving individuals. **The social implications are equally far-reaching**: the breakdown of social structures, displacement of communities, and potential for conflict over scarce resources. Finally, the spiritual implications extend to the very nature of existence, morality, and humanity's relationship with the world.

To create a sigil that captures and symbolizes this transformative energy, we will draw from various influences and themes that encapsulate the physical, social, and spiritual implications of a nuclear strike.

1. **Radiation**: To symbolize the all-encompassing radiation, we will use a central circle or sphere in the design, representing the nucleus of the atom. Within this circle, we will include a series of lines radiating outward, signifying the destructive energy emanating from it. These lines will be shaped in a specific pattern, like a spiral, to indicate the dispersion of radiation over time and space.

2. **Destruction**: Incorporate symbols of destruction and rebirth, such as the alchemical Ouroboros, which represents the cyclical nature of life and the transformation from destruction to regeneration. Within the central circle, position the Ouroboros encircling the radiating lines.

3. **Social Collapse**: To represent the collapse of social structures, incorporate a broken chain or divided triangle in the design, symbolizing the disintegration of societal bonds and the need for unity in the rebuilding process.

4. **Spiritual Implications**: To address the spiritual aspects of the event, include symbols of enlightenment, transcendence, and unity. One possibility is to use a lotus flower, a symbol often used in spiritual practices to represent self-transformation and growth in adverse conditions. Place the lotus at the top of the radiating lines, enveloping the entirety of the sigil, to reflect the potential for personal and collective transformation.

5. **The Phoenix**: We could introduce the image of the phoenix rising from the ashes to accentuate the themes of rebirth and regeneration against the backdrop of such destructive force.

Taking all these aspects into consideration, a potential design for the sigil could be a central circle representing the nucleus of the atom with radiating spiral lines. Enclosed by the Ouroboros, it would include a broken chain or divided triangle, with the lotus flower and phoenix imagery along the lines.

In conclusion, the sigil representing the transformative energies unleashed in the aftermath of a nuclear strike would entail the merging of symbols of radiation, destruction, societal collapse, spiritual growth, and rebirth. By doing so, it would capture the physical, social, and spiritual implications of such a catastrophic event while also conveying the potential for regeneration and unity in its wake.
