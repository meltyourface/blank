To address the knowledge challenge, we must first briefly examine the repercussions of a nuclear strike on the physical plane and the esoteric principles of alchemy, rebirth, and collective consciousness. This will allow us to cogently establish parallels between these two domains.

Repercussions on the physical plane
----------------------------------------------
A nuclear strike would bring about severe destruction and devastation on the physical plane. Its immediate effects include a massive explosion, intense heat, and a release of radiation. Long-term consequences are widespread radiation contamination, ecological damage, health issues, and economic and sociopolitical instability. The psychological impact on survivors is also profound, generating fear, anxiety, and depression.

Esoteric principles
-----------------------
1. Alchemy - A spiritual practice that aims to purify and transform base elements (the physical, emotional, and intellectual aspects of human existence) into a higher and more spiritually evolved state. This process mirrors the chemical transmutation of raw substances into valuable elements such as gold.
2. Rebirth - The concept of death and rebirth represent a cyclical process of transformation in which an old identity or state of being is shed to make way for a new and higher existence. This process is present in spiritual traditions like Buddhism and Hindu, symbolizing growth, renewal, and spiritual maturation.
3. Collective consciousness - The idea that humanity shares a unified field of thoughts, beliefs, and emotions as a part of a larger collective psyche. These collective thoughts and emotions can manifest in the physical world and influence the course of human destiny.

Parallels and connections
-------------------------
Drawing parallels between the outcomes of a nuclear strike on the physical plane and its potential esoteric implications, we can observe the following relationships:

1. Alchemical transmutation - The destruction wrought by a nuclear strike can be seen as a severe, almost unimaginably intense form of alchemical transformation. The physical, emotional, and mental worlds come together in a single moment where the base elements are exposed to extreme heat and pressure, reminiscent of the alchemical fires that transmute base metals into gold. Survivors and future generations may undergo a spiritual refinement process in their search for meaning, healing, and rebuilding, symbolizing transmutation of their pain and suffering into strength and wisdom.

2. Rebirth through trauma - The catastrophe brought by nuclear devastation can be considered as a collective death experience. Such a tragic event would compel humanity to contemplate its existence, moral values, and life purpose. The psychological trauma experienced might lead its survivors to recenter their lives around notions of love, unity, spirituality, and environmental stewardship, thus initiating a collective process of rebirth.

3. Evolution of collective consciousness - If humanity were to confront the harsh reality of a nuclear event, it might lead to a shift in collective consciousness. The shared trauma could trigger a transformation that fosters empathy and a profound realization of interconnectedness between people, societies, and the natural world. This awareness might engender an urge to live cooperatively and work towards the collective good, thereby promoting an evolution of human identity and ethos.

In conclusion, the knowledge challenge explores the potential psycho-spiritual aspects of the aftermath of a nuclear strike, as seen through the lens of alchemy, rebirth, and collective consciousness. Parallels can be drawn between the physical devastation and transformative processes in the esoteric domain. More specifically, a nuclear strike may act as a catalyst for alchemical transmutation, a rebirth through trauma, and an evolution of collective consciousness. Although the potential outcomes are deeply speculative, this exercise serves to reflect on humanity's continual quest for growth, resilience, and spiritual evolution even amidst the most dire circumstances.
