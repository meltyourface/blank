In order to examine the aftermath of a nuclear strike on the collective unconscious of humanity, we must first delve into the core concepts of the collective unconscious and the archetypal figures that underpin it. The concept of the collective unconscious, as postulated by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, suggests that there exists a psychic layer of shared unconscious knowledge and images, or archetypes, that unite all humans. These archetypes are believed to embody universal experiences or themes such as birth, death, love, the hero's journey, and so on.

Following the catastrophic event of a nuclear strike, the impact on the collective unconscious would be unprecedented, leading to a transformation of the archetypes and the emergence or resurgence of esoteric beliefs and spiritual practices. The devastation and chaos would create a reality where survivors grapple with their psychological and physical environments, forcing a reevaluation of both individual and collective beliefs.

Among the archetypes that would undergo a significant shift in the post-apocalyptic world are:
1. **The Shadow**: This archetype would be strongly amplified as humanity faces its own destructive nature reflected in the nuclear devastation. The Shadow represents the unconscious aspects of the self that an individual or society must confront and integrate. As survivors come to terms with their fragility and potential for evil, they would also discover the possibility of transformation and healing.

2. **The Hero**: The Hero archetype would manifest as those survivors who take responsibility for the greater good, working tirelessly to rebuild society and uncover the seeds of a new spiritual awakening. These heroes may not possess supernatural powers, yet they matter because of their courage, determination, and hope in the face of overwhelming odds.

3. **The Wounded Healer**: As a result of their own trauma and loss, some survivors may become naturally empathetic and attuned to the suffering of others. This sensitivity could lead to the emergence of spiritual healers, therapists, and teachers who guide and support others in healing and rebuilding themselves and their communities.

4. **The Alchemist**: The practice of alchemy – the art of transforming base metals into gold – has a symbolic parallel in the aftermath of a nuclear strike. **Alchemists sought a substance called the Philosopher's Stone**: a catalyst for transformation. In the post-apocalyptic world, survivors may find themselves searching for their own Philosopher's Stone, in the form of inner wisdom or personal growth, crucial in transforming their shattered world.

The alchemical processes that would be central to the aftermath of a nuclear strike revolve around the three stages of transformation - Nigredo (Blackening), Albedo (Whitening), and Rubedo (Reddening).

1. **Nigredo**: This stage represents the dissolution of the old world and the breaking down of structures. The collective unconscious would be inundated with despair, grief, and disorientation.

2. **Albedo**: As survivors begin to adapt and regroup, the collective unconscious would shift to a state of purification, reassessing their core beliefs and values in light of the new reality. This stage sees a surge in esoteric and spiritual practices, serving as coping mechanisms and offering hope.

3. **Rubedo**: Eventually, humanity would strive to create a new world from the ashes, integrating the lessons and knowledge gained from the tragedy. This phase corresponds to the emergence of new leaders, ideas, and spiritual practices that serve to rebuild the foundations of society.

In summary, the aftermath of a nuclear strike would profoundly impact the collective unconscious of humanity, transforming archetypal figures and intensifying the alchemical processes necessary for rebirth and renewal. As survivors confront the most harrowing aspects of their psyche and environment, their response would catalyze the emergence or resurgence of esoteric beliefs and spiritual practices, guiding humanity to rise again from the ashes and forge a new world imbued with newfound wisdom and hope.
