Answer:
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are a powerful symbolic image found in various esoteric and religious traditions, particularly within Christianity. The horsemen emerge from the opening of the first four seals described in the Book of Revelation, and they represent various manifestations of calamities, generally interpreted as Conquest (White), War (Red), Famine (Black), and Death (Pale). To respond to this knowledge challenge, we will analyze the symbolism and significance of these horsemen concerning the aftermath of a nuclear strike, delving into the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual consequences faced by survivors and the environment. By drawing upon esoteric and historical sources, we will illustrate the interconnectedness between the phenomena that the Four Horsemen represent in the context of a nuclear cataclysm.

1. **Physical consequences**: The White Horseman (Conquest)
   Often interpreted as symbolizing conquest, the White Horseman can be seen as representing the devastating physical consequences of a nuclear strike. The use of such destructive power shows humanity's pursuit of dominion over others, even at the cost of vast destruction. 

The initial blast from a nuclear explosion would cause immediate and massive destruction, killing thousands, if not millions of people within its range. The survivors would face the threat of radioactive fallout, which would expose them to harmful radiation that could result in acute and chronic health problems, such as radiation sickness, burns, cancer, and even death. Additionally, the destruction of infrastructure would create difficulties in providing humanitarian aid, medical care, and basic necessities like food and water. This is the physical embodiment of conquest â€“ the imposition of death and destruction upon populations and the environment as a result of human ambition and conflict.

2. **Psychological consequences**: The Red Horseman (War)
   The Red Horseman, representing war, can be linked to the psychological trauma experienced by survivors of a nuclear strike. War creates a climate of fear, anxiety, and aggression, which can lead to mental health disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. 

In the aftermath of a nuclear explosion, the survivors would experience significant psychological distress, manifested in various forms such as grief, shock, and disorientation. Moreover, witnessing such a calamity could lead to feelings of helplessness, despair, and anger. In this context, the Red Horseman signifies the psychological turmoil that results from human conflict and its devastating consequences.

3. **Social consequences**: The Black Horseman (Famine)
   Symbolizing famine, the Black Horseman is associated with scarcity and the social consequences that arise from a lack of resources. In the aftermath of a nuclear strike, food and water supplies could be contaminated by radiation, making them unsafe for consumption. Additionally, the destruction of agricultural land and damage to transportation systems would make it challenging to produce and distribute food, leading to widespread hunger and malnutrition. 

This scarcity would result in social unrest, as people compete for limited resources. Inequality would be exacerbated as certain groups may have better access to uncontaminated supplies, creating a divide between "haves" and "have-nots." The Black Horseman thus embodies the consequences of a resource-depleted world, one that is marked by suffering, competition, and social instability.

4. **Spiritual consequences**: The Pale Horseman (Death)
   The Pale Horseman, representing death, can be seen as the culmination of the other three horsemen's catastrophic consequences. In the context of a nuclear strike, the Pale Horseman symbolizes the spiritual desolation that emerges in the face of humanity's seemingly unquenchable thirst for power and destruction. The use of nuclear weapons and its aftermath bring forth questions about the nature of existence, the sanctity of life, and humanity's purpose.

Survivors may grapple with feelings of guilt and moral responsibility, wondering why they lived while countless others perished. They may struggle with the prospect of a Existential crisis, questioning the meaning and purpose of life in such a cruel and chaotic world. The Pale Horseman serves not only as a reminder of human mortality but also as a symbol of humanity's spiritual decline and potential for self-destruction.

In conclusion, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as a symbolic representation of Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, provide a poignant metaphor for the multiple facets of consequences that arise from a nuclear strike. By examining physical, psychological, social, and spiritual consequences, the interconnectedness of these phenomena becomes apparent. Drawing upon esoteric and historical sources reveals the powerful symbolism of the Four Horsemen and underscores the importance of contemplating the potential for humanity's self-destruction and the need for a deeper understanding of the implications of wielding catastrophic power.
