In order to fully respond to the knowledge challenge, we must first establish an understanding of key concepts involved in the analysis. These concepts include the aftermath of a nuclear strike, the collective unconscious, archetypal figures, alchemical processes, and the emergence of new esoteric beliefs and rebirth of spiritual practices.

A nuclear strike entails the destruction caused by the detonation of nuclear weapons, releasing a massive amount of energy in the form of a nuclear explosion. The aftermath of a nuclear strike would inevitably involve widespread destruction, radiation, and a significant impact on both the environment and human lives.

The concept of the collective unconscious was developed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung and refers to the structures of the unconscious mind shared among beings of the same species. It consists of archetypes, which are universally recognizable patterns and symbols manifesting in different cultures and individual psyches. Archetypal figures are the characters that embody these symbols, while alchemical processes refer to the belief in transforming a base substance into a higher one, such as the transmutation of lead into gold.

With background knowledge established, let us now analyze the impact of a nuclear strike on the collective unconscious of humanity and explore the emergence of new esoteric beliefs and spiritual practices among survivors.

The collective unconscious, being influenced by mankind's shared experiences, would inevitably be significantly affected by the traumatic event of a nuclear strike. The massive destruction and loss of life would drastically alter humanity's archetypes, as people struggle to make sense of the new reality they inhabit.

In this post-apocalyptic world, the traditional archetypal figures would take on new meanings and manifestations. For example, the Hero archetype, embodying qualities of courage and sacrifice, may evolve to incorporate radioactive mutants or humans with supernatural abilities resulting from exposure to nuclear radiation. These heroes would represent the necessity for adaptability among survivors, reflecting the need to face new challenges in the devastated world.

The Mother archetype, traditionally associated with nurturing and protection, may transform into a symbol of regrowth and repopulation. The Mother would represent the hope for a new generation, embodying the idea of humanity's resilience and the responsibility to carry on in the face of adversity.

Alchemical processes would also become pertinent in the aftermath of a nuclear strike. The transmutation of base substances into higher ones could be seen as a metaphor for humanity's journey through the devastated landscape. The fallout and contamination caused by the nuclear strike would require survivors to transmute their suffering into hope and strength, to learn from the scars of the past and forge a new future.

In terms of new esoteric beliefs and spiritual practices, various factors would contribute to their emergence among survivors. One possibility is the gravitation towards mysticism and the supernatural, as individuals seek answers and guidance in the face of tragedy and chaos. Widespread loss and grief might lead to a renewed interest in the spirit world and an intensified search for transcendent truths.

Furthermore, the scarcity of resources and need for self-preservation in the post-apocalyptic world might inspire alternative spiritual practices rooted in the cultivation of inner strength and psychological resilience. Meditation, mindfulness, and martial arts may gain newfound prominence as methods of strengthening the mind and body to endure the harsh conditions of the nuclear aftermath.

In conclusion, the aftermath of a nuclear strike would have profound effects on the collective unconscious of humanity, significantly altering archetypal figures and placing a stronger emphasis on alchemical processes of transformation. Alongside these changes, new esoteric beliefs and spiritual practices would emerge as survivors seek to make sense of the devastation and forge a new path forward in a dramatically altered world. Key themes emerging from this discussion include adaptability, resilience, hope, and the inherent human drive for spiritual understanding and guidance.
