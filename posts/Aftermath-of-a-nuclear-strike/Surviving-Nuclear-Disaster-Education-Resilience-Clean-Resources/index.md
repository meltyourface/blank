The answer is: Educational level, psychological resilience, and access to non-contaminated food and water sources.

In the aftermath of a nuclear strike, many factors can affect the long-term survival and recovery of the affected population. However, among the options presented, the combination of educational level, psychological resilience, and access to non-contaminated food and water sources plays an essential role.

Education level is a vital factor as it creates a baseline understanding of the dangers and effects of radiation and nuclear fallout, enabling individuals to make informed decisions about their safety, protection, and how to mitigate those hazards. A higher education level also means that people might be better equipped to find or create solutions for the challenges they face during and after the disaster.

Psychological resilience is crucial for helping individuals cope with the traumatic experience of a nuclear strike and its aftermath. The ability to adapt and maintain a positive outlook will aid survivors in staying motivated to face the daunting recovery process. It will also contribute to preventing the development of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Having access to non-contaminated food and water sources is fundamental for the immediate and long-term survival of the affected population. Ingesting contaminated substances can result in serious health issues and even death. Adequate and safe food supplies, combined with knowledge about how to identify and decontaminate radiation-contaminated resources, are essential for maintaining the health and well-being of survivors.

While aspects like strategic alliances, rituals, and availability of advanced medical care are also relevant, they are not the most significant factors in the long-term survival and recovery of the population. Similarly, knowledge of handling paranormal beings and occult practices can be interesting and engaging for some, but they wouldn't have a direct impact on the real-world situations brought on by a nuclear event.

Understanding the various factors that contribute to survival and recovery after a nuclear strike can empower communities and individuals to develop better strategies and resource management plans, enhancing the chances of a successful recovery and rehabilitation process in the face of a catastrophic event.
