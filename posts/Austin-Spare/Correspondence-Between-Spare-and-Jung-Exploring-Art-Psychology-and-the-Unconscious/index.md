Letter 1: Austin Spare to Carl Jung

Dear Dr. Carl Jung,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is Austin Spare, and I am an artist and occultist with a passion for delving into the realms of the unknown. I have recently become quite fascinated by your groundbreaking work in the field of psychology, particularly your theories on archetypes and the collective unconscious.

As a practitioner of sigil-based magic, I have often found myself exploring similar territories. Through the use of intricate symbols, I tap into the power of the unconscious mind to bring about desired effects in the material world. I have developed a particular method for creating these sigils, which involves an initial stage of automatic drawing, followed by a more focused refinement of the distinct symbolic representations that emerge. I believe that the essence of this practice lies in its ability to access the vast reservoir of atavistic resurgence, thereby harnessing the raw power of the primordial self.

Having acquainted myself with your theories on the nature of dreams and archetypal symbols, I wonder if there might be a fruitful overlap between your work and my own. Could it be possible that the sigils I create tap into the collective unconscious and allow for the manifestation of archetypal energies? Moreover, might the practice of sigil magic, in concert with your analytical psychology, provide new pathways towards individuation and psychological transformation?

I eagerly await your thoughts on this matter and hope that our correspondence may lead to a deeper understanding of the ties that bind our respective practices.

Yours sincerely,

Austin Osman Spare

Letter 2: Carl Jung to Austin Spare

Dear Mr. Austin Spare,

Thank you for your intriguing letter. As a man who seeks to explore the depths of the human psyche, I find your artistic and esoteric practices most captivating. Your method of sigil creation, which combines elements of automatic drawing with a more conscious examination of the resulting symbols, invites comparison with the process of active imagination that I advocate for in my own work.

I do believe that your sigils have the potential to tap into the collective unconscious, thus enabling you to access and manifest archetypal energies. As these symbols emerge from the unconscious mind, so too do they resonate with the archetypal patterns that govern the human experience. The connection between your work and mine, it seems, may lie in this shared exploration of the symbolic realm.

As for the potential synergies between sigil magic and analytical psychology, we must be cautious in our speculation. However, I am not averse to the idea that the use of sigils, coupled with a deep understanding of the transformative power of the archetype, could indeed provide new pathways towards individuation. The power that resides in the realms of art, the occult, and the depths of our own consciousness invites us to tread new ground, and I welcome the opportunity to explore these territories alongside you.

It is my hope that our correspondence will enrich our understanding of the mysteries that pervade both art and psychology and shed light on the intertwining roots of creativity and transformation.

Yours sincerely,

Carl Gustav Jung
