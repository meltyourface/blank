## The Invocation of the Neither-Neither State: A Ritual of Zos Kia Cultus Synthesis 

**Objective**: To create a powerful, immersive ritual that synthesizes Austin Spare's principles of Zos Kia Cultus, sigil magic, automatic drawing, and the Neither-Neither state, challenging traditional ritual structure and opening participants to new realms of consciousness.

**Preparation**:

1. **Ritual space**: Select a quiet, private indoor or outdoor space. Cleanse the area using sage or incense, then create a large circle using a chalk or a cord.

2. **Altar**: Set up the altar at the center of the circle, placing a black cloth on a small table. Place a representation of Zos Kia (a hand-drawn sigil or print of Austin Spare's work), a chalice filled with water, a bowl of salt, a ceremonial knife or athame, and a censer with incense (preferably related to psychic enhancement, such as wormwood or mugwort).

3. **Ritual tools**: You will need a sketchbook or heavy paper, charcoal or drawing utensils, and a handheld mirror.

4. **Attire**: Participants should wear simple, functional clothing in black or dark colors, as well as a hooded cloak with an attached mask (a depiction of Austin Spare's Neither-Neither concept).

5. **Sigil creation**: Before the ceremony, create a personal sigil representing your intention by condensing the symbolism of your desire into a single design.

The Ritual:

1. **Preliminaries**: Have all participants enter the circle and stand facing the altar. Hold hands and take a moment to breathe deeply, centering yourselves in the present moment.

2. **Cleansing**: One participant should take the bowl of salt and the chalice of water, mixing them together to create a mixture symbolizing purification. Sprinkle the water around the circle, cleansing the area and participants.

3. **Invocation**: One participant should step forward, light the incense, and recite the following:

"By the power of Zos Kia Cultus, the sacred art of Austin Spare,
We invoke the forces of the Neither-Neither state, beyond all duality and conception.
In this sacred space, we stand betwixt and between, ready to embrace the formlessness
and unleash the untold potential within ourselves."

4. **Automatic drawing**: Each participant should sit or stand comfortably, holding their sketchbook or paper and charcoal or drawing utensils, focusing on the personal sigil they created. Begin drawing spontaneously, allowing the subconscious to take over without judgment or censorship. Do this for about 15 minutes.

5. **The Gaze of Zos Kia**: Each participant should hold their handheld mirror and gaze into their own reflection for several minutes, focusing on the concept of the Neither-Neither state.

6. **Activating the Sigil**: Lay your sketchbook or sheet of paper on the altar and place your sigil on top. **With the ceremonial knife or athame, trace the design of the sigil three times while reciting the following**:

"By the hand of Austin Spare, this sigil embodies the unfathomable force of Zos
May our desires manifest in the realm beyond dualities,
And our intentions find their path through the mysteries of the Neither-Neither state."

7. **Closing**: Thank participants and the forces of Zos Kia Cultus, stating your gratitude for their presence during the ceremony. Extinguish the incense and dismiss the energies invoked.

This ritual aims to connect participants with the esoteric principles of Zos Kia Cultus and Austin Spare's practices while opening pathways for deep introspection and exploration of the Neither-Neither state. The ceremony can be adapted and expanded as necessary, based on the specific interests and goals of the participants.
