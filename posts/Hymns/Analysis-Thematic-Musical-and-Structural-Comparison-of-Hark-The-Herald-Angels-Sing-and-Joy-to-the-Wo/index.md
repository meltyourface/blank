For this task, I will analyze two hymns from the 18th century: Charles Wesley's "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" (1739) and Isaac Watts' "Joy to the World" (1719). Both hymns are celebrated Christmas carols, and I will examine their thematic and lyrical similarities, musical patterns, and poetic structures to assess any potential instances of plagiarism or influence between the two.

1. **Thematic and Lyrical similarities**:

"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" is a hymn celebrating the birth of Christ and the joy it brings to people. **It focuses on the arrival of angels announcing Christ's birth**:

"Hark! The herald angels sing, 
Glory to the newborn King."

In contrast, "Joy to the World" centers on both the nativity and the eventual kingdom of Christ. **The lyrics emphasize the joy of redemption and salvation**:

"Joy to the world! The Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King."

Although both hymns have the same theme of Christ's birth and joy, their lyrical focus differs. Wesley's hymn concentrates on the angels' proclamation, while Watts centers on the anticipation and joy surrounding Christ's arrival. The thematic variation reduces the likelihood of direct copying or unwarranted influence.

2. **Musical Patterns**:

Both hymns consist of a memorable and distinct melody. "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" is set to the tune of Mendelssohn's "Gutenberg Cantata," while "Joy to the World" utilizes the music from Handel's "Messiah."

Comparing the melodies, there is no apparent similarity in the musical progressions. Both hymn tunes are unique, easily distinguishable, and invoke different feelings when listened to or sung. Therefore, it is improbable that one hymn plagiarized the other's melody.

3. **Poetic Structures**:

"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" follows a poetic structure of AABB, employing a consistently alternating rhyming pattern. The meter is 77 77 D, meaning there are seven syllables in each line, and the D indicates an added line length in each stanza.

"Joy to the World," on the other hand, presents an AAAB structure, placing emphasis on the final line to convey a sense of completion. The hymn employs a slightly different 86 86 meter, where the first and third lines have eight syllables, and the second and fourth lines have six.

While both hymns utilize the common hymn structures present in the 18th century, their different meters and rhyming patterns denote distinct individual compositions.

**Conclusion**:

After examining the thematic and lyrical similarities, musical patterns, and poetic structures of Charles Wesley's "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" and Isaac Watts' "Joy to the World," it is unlikely that either hymn directly copied or unduly influenced the other. Although both hymns celebrate the birth of Christ, their distinct focuses, melodies, and structures reveal their unique and creative origins.
