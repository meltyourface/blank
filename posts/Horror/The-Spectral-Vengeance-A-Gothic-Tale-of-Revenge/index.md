Upon a night of forlorn gloom, when moonbeams dread the starless void,
A vile encounter, haunt and i√§le, sweeps across the blasted moor.
The vengeful wraith, in spectral pall, its visage worn of mortal coil,
Did once partake, with living breath, a twisted life of tainted toil.

From murky mists, a figure borne; the revenant so dearly scorned,
To trifle not with fate's contempt, it seeketh hence a morbid toll.
In shadows deep, below the veil, its formless shape doth writhe and roil,
And ghostly whispers chill the night, like secrets kept in cryptic scroll.

"Vengeance sought, in darkened plight, upon the souls who wronged me thrice.
For naught have they my kindness lain, but bitter, black betrayal bide."
And with a howl, unearthly wail, to fatal ends its curse implied,
The ethereal harbinger of dread, upon a hunt infernal, rides.

The haunted moor recoils in fear, as gnarled limbs of twisted boughs,
Silent onlookers, ancient trees, conspire with the eerie scene.
Moonlit tendrils cloud the sky, a morbid tapestry of gory shrouds,
Enwinding limbs, and bleating cries, obscured within a veiled sheen.

In air that stales like open tombs, a malevolence so fierce doth seethe,
To claim revenge this woeful shade, relentless in its grim pursuit.
The unsuspecting reprobates, spellbound by fate's unyielding wreath,
Shall face the scourge of horror's grace, and penance pay in blood and truth.

What shadows cast, from troubled past, could forge a spirit so consumed,
By vengeance' call, from Hades' halls, it wakes to walk unhallowed ground?
In ceaseless terror, mournful woe, is found the crux of spectral doom,
The remnants of a life once loved, in bitter pangs of sorrow drowned.

Just as the chapel-bell doth toll, to summon forth the damned brigade,
This specter sways within the spheres, to lead its quarry to the deep.
From hidden chambers, buried truths, a tragic tale to horror's blade,
The ghastly truth unveiled, the spiral dark, will haunt and creep.

For know thy sins be ne'er assuaged, nor spirits quiet ever find,
Whilst through the abyss of bitter hearts, they wander weighty chains of strife.
In frozen silence, lies concealed, the torment of eternal binds,
To echo, pines a ceaseless threnody, the cost of deeds which cast a blight.

And so the core of twisted time, befall the shadowed fate's decree,
The phantom's wail, a mournful knell, continues in the black abyss.
As mortal flesh doth turn to dust, but ghastly souls may never flee,
Forever bound to vengeance' march, a leader in the void of whispers.
