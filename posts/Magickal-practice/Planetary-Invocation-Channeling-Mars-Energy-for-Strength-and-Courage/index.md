excerpt: Design a meticulously crafted planetary invocation, dedicated to channeling the formidable and alchemical energies of Mars, with the distinct intentions of strengthening one's courage, self-assurance, and unwavering confidence. Incorporate Mars-associated symbols, sigils, and correspondences such as iron, red candles, and specific astrological timing to ensure a stronger connection with the celestial sphere's dominant vibrations. Invoke the spirit of protective deities or entities related to Mars, such as Ares or Archangel Camael, to access their guidance and optimize the potency of the ritual's outcomes. Perform the invocation with a series of ritualistic steps including consecration, casting a Magick circle, and employing powerful, affirmative chants set to the frequency of 144.72 Hz that resonate deeply within the practitioner.

To design a meticulously crafted planetary invocation dedicated to channeling the formidable and alchemical energies of Mars and fulfilling the intentions mentioned, follow these steps:

1. Preparation:
Gather all materials, including:
   - Iron dagger or athame (for consecration and casting the circle)
   - Red candles (Mars is associated with the color red)
   - Incense (Dragon's Blood or Tobacco, associated with Mars)
   - Sigil of Mars 
   - Sigil of Ares or Archangel Camael (associated with Mars)
   - An altar cloth in the color red
   - Mars-associated herbs and essential oils such as ginger, basil, and peppercorn
   - A crystal bowl filled with spring water and a sprinkling of iron filings

2. Astrological Timing:
Choose the appropriate time, preferably a Tuesday when Mars rules the day, and when Mars is in Aries or Scorpio (its ruling signs) for maximum potency.

3. Consecration:
Cleanse and consecrate every tool using the iron dagger, wafting them through the incense smoke, and calling upon the energies of Mars to bless and consecrate them.

4. Casting the Magick Circle:
With the iron dagger, draw the circle clockwise, invoking the protective energies of Mars/Ares and Archangel Camael. Set the red candles at the cardinal points within the circle.

5. Invocation of Deities/Entities:
Light the candles and incense. Stand facing East, take a deep breath, and visualize the red energy of Mars flowing through your body, empowering and grounding you. Say the following invocation:

"Great Ares/Archangel Camael, protector, and warrior, 
I call upon thee to join me in this sacred circle,
Lend me your strength and courage,
Infuse my spirit with confidence and unwavering self-assurance."

Visualize the sigils of Mars and Ares/Camael glowing with red energy.

6. Chanting:
Using a tuning fork or sound generator, play a tone at 144.72 Hz and begin the chant. Repeat the following affirmation:

"By the power of Mars, I am strong, I am bold, I am fearless,
I channel the warrior within, my courage unfolds,
With every step, I take on the path, my self-assurance grows,
The fiery spirit of Mars ignites, and confidence flows."

Repeat the chant in multiple cycles for as long as you feel necessary.

7. Closing the Invocation:
Give thanks and gratitude to Ares/Archangel Camael, releasing their energy from the circle. Extinguish any candles and incense. Declare:

"By the light of Mars and the warrior's might,
I leave this circle, empowered and bright.
In gratitude, I trust, and in the alchemy, I must.
So be it."

8. The Sealing and Completion:
Using your dagger, close the circle counterclockwise, sealing the energies you have invoked within your being. Dispose of any remaining ritual materials responsibly and safely while retaining the sigils in a sacred space as a physical reminder of your magickal work.

Remark: Following these steps will ensure adequate incorporation of Mars-associated symbols, sigils, and correspondences, strengthening the celestial sphere's dominant vibrations, and invoking the protective Mars-related deities or entities.
