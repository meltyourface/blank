In order to address the knowledge challenge, we must first lay the foundation by understanding key concepts mentioned in the question - the Book of Thoth, the Four Passangers of the Tarot, the concept of duality as presented by the dyad and the triad, and an initiate's spiritual transformation. To set the stage, let's briefly define these ideas:

1. The Book of Thoth: The Book of Thoth is a name given to many ancient Egyptian texts that were believed to have been written by Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge. In today's context, the term "Book of Thoth" is often associated with Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck, which is a rich and complex system of divination and spiritual development. The Thoth Tarot integrates concepts from various occult traditions, such as Kabbalah, astrology, and Hermeticism, aimed at assisting the initiate to gain insights and understanding.

2. Four Passangers of the Tarot: Also known as the Four Kerubim or the Four Living Creatures in the vision of Ezekiel and the Book of Revelation, the Four Passangers of the Tarot are a set of archetypal figures. They represent four essential elements in the Tarot – Fire (Leo/the Lion), Water (Aquarius/the Man), Air (Taurus/the Bull), and Earth (Scorpio/the Eagle). Each Passenger corresponds to a fixed sign of the zodiac and one of the four “elements” (fire, air, earth, and water). In the Book of Thoth, these have a special significance, as they also represent the facets of existence that an initiate must understand to achieve spiritual growth and transformation.

3. Dyad and Triad: In the context of Hermetic and occult philosophy, the dyad and the triad represent the concepts of duality and unity, respectively. The dyad emphasizes the polarity between opposites, like male and female, light and dark, and creation and destruction. The triad, on the other hand, symbolizes a deeper, more complex unity that transcends the duality's apparent contradictions.

Now that we have established the context for the challenge let us move on to explain the role of the Four Passangers of the Tarot in relation to duality and how this informs the initiate's progression on the path of spiritual transformation.

The Four Passangers of the Tarot play a vital part in the initiate's understanding and navigation of dualities presented by the dyad and the triad. Since the Tarot operates on multiple levels of symbolic meaning, these Passangers offer a roadmap for balance and integration, which are essential for spiritual growth.

Firstly, by providing elemental correspondences, the Four Passangers give initiates a way to comprehend the inherent dualities within the material world and natural forces. Each of the Four Passangers symbolizes different aspects of existence, enabling initiates to appreciate the interplay of these forces and the importance of maintaining balance and equilibrium.

Secondly, the Four Passangers act as guides on the spiritual journey toward self-discovery and transformation. Each of these archetypal figures illuminates particular aspects of the human experience, presenting the initiate with an expanded understanding of their own inner terrain. By engaging with these symbols, initiates can strive to integrate and balance the various aspects of their personalities, working toward greater self-awareness and wholeness.

The triadic unity that transcends duality is key to the initiate’s spiritual transformation. By understanding the interconnections between the dyad and the triad, initiates can work towards a heightened spiritual awareness where contradictions dissolve and give way to a higher level of consciousness. On this path, initiates are encouraged to move from thinking in terms of opposites towards a more refined, threefold consciousness coinciding with our recognition of a divine presence permeating existence. This advanced level of understanding allows initiates to identify with spiritual entities beyond the confines of ego and the material world.

In conclusion, the Four Passangers of the Tarot play a crucial role in helping initiates navigate the concept of duality presented by the dyad and the triad. By engaging with the Passangers, initiates can learn to balance and integrate the various aspects of their lives, leading to personal growth and spiritual transformation. The progression on the path of spiritual transformation involves transcending dualities and achieving a higher level of consciousness grounded in a holistic understanding of the self and the universe. The Four Passangers of the Tarot stand as beacons on that journey, pointing the initiate towards the ultimate goal of spiritual enlightenment.
