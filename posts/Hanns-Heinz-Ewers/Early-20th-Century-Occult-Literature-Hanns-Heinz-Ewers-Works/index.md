Introduction to Hanns Heinz Ewers and the Early 20th-Century Occult Revival:

Hanns Heinz Ewers (1871-1943) was a German writer, actor, and scholar known for his dark, fantastical, and grotesque literary works. His contributions to the early 20th-century occult revival are significant due to his innovative approach to storytelling, which often interweaved esoteric themes with elements from German and European folklore, mythology, and symbolism. 

To analyze Ewers' impact on the occult revival, we will examine two of his prominent works: 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'Alraune.' Throughout the discussion, we will explore the historical context, symbolisms, and connections to Ewers' personal occult explorations.

Historical Context:

Ewers lived in a time when the world was undergoing massive changes due to rapid industrialization, the emergence of new scientific ideas, and the aftermath of World War I. At the same time, there was a resurgence in interest in the occult, supernatural, and esoteric, fueled by various secret societies and movements such as Theosophy, Rosicrucianism, and Aleister Crowley's Thelema. Ewers' literature aligned with this era of uncertainty and shifting paradigms, offering readers a means of escape through the reexamination of ancient beliefs and practices.

The Sorcerer's Apprentice:

'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' is a sinister and fantastical story revolving around a demonic pact between a young man, Frank Braun, and a mysterious entity, embodied by his master, the Puppeteer. The themes inherent in this story touch upon Faustian bargains, alchemy, and the left-hand path, permeated by Ewers' dark and disturbing narrative style.

**Alraune**:

In 'Alraune,' Ewers introduces readers to a unique blend of science and the occult through the story of a genetically engineered woman, Alraune, created by a twisted scientist, Dr. Ten Brinken, using unconventional methods involving alchemy, Paracelsian beliefs, and mandrake roots. Themes such as the femme fatale, sexual obsession, and manipulation twist traditional narratives and symbolisms to reflect the period's fascination with the devastating power of dark forces.

Symbolisms and Personal Occult Explorations:

Ewers employed various esoteric themes in both works. In 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice,' the character Frank Braun serves as the embodiment of the Faustian archetype, a quester for ultimate wisdom who is willing to sacrifice everything to fulfill his desires. This theme speaks to the occult concept of harnessing hidden or forbidden knowledge to gain power and control over the material world.

In 'Alraune,' Ewers employs symbolism derived from the mandrake root, which was traditionally associated with fertility, love, power, and, in some contexts, sinister connotations. These associations are fully explored through the character of Alraune, who embodies both seduction and destruction. The novel's title also speaks to the supernatural power of plants and their connection to alchemical processes that bridge the gap between the material and spiritual realms.

Ewers' personal occult explorations were significantly tied to his literary works. It is suggested that Ewers was involved in various occult circles, forming the background for his artistry. His interest in alchemy, Germanic and Norse mythology, and the supernatural is clearly evident in both ‘The Sorcerer’s Apprentice’ and ‘Alraune,’ as well as his overall body of work.

**Conclusion**:

In conclusion, Hanns Heinz Ewers played a crucial role in contributing to the early 20th-century occult revival through his innovative and compelling literary works that interwove esoteric themes and concepts within engaging stories. His application of occult ideas in 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'Alraune' drew upon a rich variety of sources, symbolisms, and connections to his personal search for hidden knowledge. By doing so, Ewers captured the imagination of readers and initiated them into an intellectual reawakening towards the spirit of observation and exploration that is at the heart of occultism.
