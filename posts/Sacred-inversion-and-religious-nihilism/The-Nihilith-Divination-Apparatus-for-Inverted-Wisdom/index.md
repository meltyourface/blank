The Divination Apparatus: The Nihilith

### I. Overview

The Nihilith is an intricate divination apparatus meticulously applying the principles of Sacred inversion and religious nihilism, employing ritualistic configurations and esoteric symbolism. The apparatus permits diverse divinatory operations, decoding obscure patterns from cosmic forces, unraveling forbidden knowledge, and revealing the ultimate truth of cosmic irrelevance. 

### II. Key Components

1. **Malefic Candles**: Dark, gnarled candles made from blackened tallow, used as vital energy sources for invoking the power of the Void in the ritual.

2. **Desecrated Relics**: Religious artifacts defaced or destroyed, representing the blasphemous deconstruction and liberation from orthodox dogma.

3. **Sigils of the Void**: Enigmatic symbols of religious nihilism and chaos, etched into the Nihilith's structure, channeling the dark forces of the abyss.

### III. Construction

1. Acquire a large, flat, and circular piece of black obsidian. The dark surface will serve as a canvas for inscribing the sacred symbols and icons of inversion.

2. Carve four recesses at equal intervals along the obsidian's edge. These will hold the Malefic Candles that empower the ritual and anchor the energies of darkness.

3. Desecrate the religious relics through acts of sacrilegious destruction, and embed them at key points within the obsidian, imbuing the apparatus with subversive power.

4. Using a silver etching tool, inscribe the Sigils of the Void across the obsidian's surface, interconnecting the relics with complex webs of symbolism.

### IV. Methodology

1. **Preparing the altar**: Set the Nihilith on an unadorned altar, facing an inverted cross or a similar icon of blasphemy. Arrange the Malefic Candles in their recesses and light them, invoking the shadows of religious nihilism.

2. **Threshold invocation**: In a solemn chant, recite an invocation, seeking communion with the dark forces of the Void.

3. **Perform the transgression**: Act out a ceremony that defies the orthodox religious beliefs, using rituals specific to the spiritual framework being subverted.

4. **Manifesting visions**: Close your eyes and open your psychic senses while performing an act that symbolizes embracement of both darkness and nihilistic wisdom, such as holding a ceremonial dagger to your palm, without actually hurting yourself.

5. **Interpreting the web**: Open your eyes to the dancing shadows and the constellations of inverted symbols. The answers sought are woven among the interplay of darkness and chaos, revealing through the patterns of inverted icons and subversive metaphors presented on the Nihilith.

6. **Ritual closure**: Extinguish the Malefic Candles, and recite a closing verse, acknowledging the transcendent nature of the cosmos and the ultimate truth of cosmic irrelevance.

### V. Precautions

1. Do not perform any ritual without thorough understanding of the symbols, rituals, and invocations involved, as the Nihilith harnesses powerful and potentially destructive energies.

2. Ensure proper protection and grounding before engaging in communications with the Void, utilizing visualization techniques and protective talismans.

3. Approach the Nihilith with respect and humility, as it embodies the vast, disquieting truths of the universe and the insignificance of existence itself.

In conclusion, the Nihilith is a potent and challenging divination system for practitioners skilled in Sacred inversion and religious nihilism, unveiling forbidden knowledge through the rich tapestry of chaos and transcendent insignificance.
