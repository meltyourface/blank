In order to answer this knowledge challenge comprehensively, the first step is to understand the key concepts of sacred inversion and religious nihilism before diving into the principles and rituals associated with them. Following this, the discussion will focus on how their interplay leads to the transcendence of traditional religious paradigms and the affirmation of the innate human desire for spiritual connection and meaning.

Sacred Inversion:
Sacred inversion is a concept rooted in the esoteric and occult, which refers to the deliberate subversion or reversal of traditional religious ideas, symbols, or practices to challenge dogmatic belief systems and facilitate the exploration of alternative perspectives on spirituality. This can include the re-interpretation of sacred texts, re-appropriation of religious iconography, or the development of new rituals and practices that aim to overturn established norms.

Religious Nihilism:
Religious nihilism is a philosophical stance that rejects the existence of intrinsic meaning, purpose, or value in religious beliefs and practices. It argues that religious ideologies are ultimately groundless, and therefore, any notions of divinity or supernatural power are devoid of inherent significance. It's crucial to understand that religious nihilism is not synonymous with atheism, as it doesn't specifically deny the existence of a god or gods, but rather posits that religious beliefs and practices lack objective meaning.

Principles and Rituals:

Sacred Inversion Principles:
1. **Challenging dogma**: Encouraging individuals to think critically and question the authority of established religious institutions.
2. **Embracing taboo**: Delving into forbidden or marginalized aspects of spirituality to uncover hidden truths and insights.
3. **Seeking personal empowerment**: Pursuing spiritual growth and self-discovery through the exploration of alternative belief systems and practices.

Sacred Inversion Rituals:
1. **Rituals of inversion**: Symbolically reversing traditional religious practices, such as reciting prayers backward or performing rituals in unconventional ways.
2. **Reinterpreting sacred texts**: Identifying and exploring alternative interpretations of religious scripture, often with focus on esoteric meanings or parallels between different belief systems.
3. **Adopting transformative symbolism**: Using imagery and symbols associated with transgression, rebellion, or personal transformation to subvert conventional religious norms.

Religious Nihilism Principles:
1. **Skepticism**: Adopting a critical stance towards religious beliefs, questioning their validity and relevance.
2. **Embracing uncertainty**: Accepting the inherent ambiguity of human existence and recognizing the limits of human knowledge and understanding.
3. **Disillusionment**: Recognizing the emptiness of religious dogmas and relinquishing the search for absolute truth or divine guidance.

Religious Nihilism Rituals:
1. **Deconstructive rituals**: Engaging with religious beliefs and practices in a way that highlights their constructed nature and underlying power dynamics.
2. **Existential reflection**: Contemplating the human condition in the absence of objective meaning or a transcendent divine order.
3. **Practicing individual autonomy**: Emphasizing personal responsibility and agency in shaping one's own spiritual path, independent of external authorities or institutions.

Interplay and Transcendence:
The interplay between sacred inversion and religious nihilism promotes the transcendence of traditional religious paradigms by destabilizing established belief systems and opening up space for alternative spiritual perspectives and practices. By challenging dogma and embracing taboo, sacred inversion encourages individuals to step beyond institutionalized norms and engage with spirituality in novel, innovative ways. Concurrently, religious nihilism fosters a critical interrogation of foundational religious concepts and the cultivation of a more nuanced, experientially-rooted understanding of spiritual truth.

Affirmation of Spiritual Connection and Meaning:
While the principles of sacred inversion and religious nihilism may initially seem to undermine the prospect of genuine spiritual connection and meaning, their ultimate effect can be paradoxically liberating. By breaking free from religious dogma and urging individuals to forge their own spiritual paths, these approaches can catalyze a more authentic and personally meaningful engagement with transcendent aspects of the human experience.

In conclusion, the interplay between sacred inversion and religious nihilism cultivates both the transcendence of traditional religious paradigms and the affirmation of the innate human desire for spiritual connection and meaning. By dismantling dogmatic belief structures and embracing alternative perspectives on spirituality, practitioners can forge deeper insights and more authentic relationships with the transcendent dimensions of existence. The key themes that emerge from this exploration include challenging dogma, embracing taboo, personal empowerment, skepticism, uncertainty, and disillusionment.
