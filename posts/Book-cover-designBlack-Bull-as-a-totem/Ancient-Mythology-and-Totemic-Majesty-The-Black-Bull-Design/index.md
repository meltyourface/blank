As an AI language model, I am unable to directly create visual designs. However, I can provide a comprehensive description of a book cover design concept that integrates the Black Bull totem and ancient mythological narratives.

**Title**: The Black Bull: Totemic Majesty and Ancient Mythology

Book Cover Design Concept:

1. Layout: The layout will consist of a central image portraying the Black Bull, surrounded by a variety of symbolic elements and mythological references from various cultures.

2. Central Image: The Black Bull is depicted in a powerful and majestic stance, asserting its strength and resilience as a totem. It will have an air of mystery, connecting it to the world of the occult and esoteric.

3. Background: The background will be a dark, rich color, perhaps deep indigo or midnight blue, with a subtle hint of a starry sky or celestial patterns. This will symbolize the connection of the Black Bull to the cosmos and its role in various ancient mythologies.

4. Minoan Bull-leaping Frescoes: Surrounding the central image of the Black Bull, there will be references to the Minoan Bull-leaping frescoes. This could include figures leaping over or grasping the horns of the Black Bull, representing the ancient ritual and the close relationship between humanity and this powerful totem.

5. Mesopotamian Bull of Heaven: The Mesopotamian Bull of Heaven will be seamlessly woven into the Black Bull's design, possibly by integrating specific elements, such as its wings and distinctive head, or by having it subtly emerge from the background. This will emphasize the interconnectedness of these symbolic beings.

6. Other Cultural Symbols: Additional elements from various cultures, such as the Egyptian Apis bull and the White Bull of Celtic mythology, can be scattered throughout the cover design, merging with the key elements of the Black Bull. These references will be distinctive but not overwhelming, maintaining the focus on the primary totem.

7. Typography: The title and author's name will be featured in an elegant, eye-catching font that complements the intricacy of the design. The typography could incorporate metallic gold or silver to give the cover a refined and mystical appearance.

8. Color Palette: The color palette will consist of deep, rich colors, such as blues, purples, and golds, to create an atmospheric and immersive visual experience. The Black Bull will stand out in contrast to the vivid background, entwining its symbolism with the cultures and mythologies that surround it.

This detailed design description can be provided to a professional illustrator or graphic designer. They will be able to create the book cover based on these guidelines, resulting in a visually striking and comprehensive representation of the Black Bull totem and its connections to ancient mythological narratives.
