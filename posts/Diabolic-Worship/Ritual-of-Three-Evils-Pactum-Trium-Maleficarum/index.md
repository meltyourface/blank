## I. ****Introduction of the Infernal Pact Ritual****: Pactum Trium Maleficarum

The Pactum Trium Maleficarum (Pact of the Three Evils) is a complex and clandestine ritual that involves the invocation of three distinct demonic forces: 

1. Azrathor, the Embodiment of Destruction and Decimation
2. Belphora, the Marquess of Manipulation and Deceit
3. Cruxthorion, the Bringer of Dark Knowledge and Shadow Arts

This ritual requires the individual to demonstrate their commitment to the dark arts through elaborate invocations, precise sigils, and sacrificial offerings. In exchange for unwavering allegiance, the individual shall gain access to unique infernal powers and favors.

### II. Invocations and Sigils

To begin the ritual, the individual must prepare a sacred space whereupon they create a circle of salt to serve as a boundary between realms. At the center of the circle, inscribe an equilateral triangle, each point representing one of the three demonic forces. Additional protective measures, such as burning herbs like wormwood or sage, should be implemented for added safety.

Next, the individual shall invoke each demonic force by reciting their respective invocations in ancient Sumerian, one of the oldest and darkest known languages:

1. **Azrathor**:

"Ug-gur Azrathor, ishkur-sarru amēlu qallatu, śāṭ-ru turpīq!Šēru-šu erēšu harbu-šu ina kišādi!"

Translation: "Rise, Azrathor, mighty storm king, shatterer of worlds! Stride upon the ashes of your conquest!"

2. **Belphora**:

"Puhrak Belphora, dāru saharsu, nīšu tu'em! Maqātu-su isabbatsa, šanīnāru purkullu-su!"

Translation: "Emerge, Belphora, whispering seductress, weaver of lies! Unveil your illusions and shroud us in deceit!”

3. **Cruxthorion**:

"Haddi Cruxthorion, pirištu elû, nīšu ēpušta! Iš-kunu-su mehretu sinništu amēlu tallaktu!"

Translation: "Reveal yourself, Cruxthorion, hidden watcher, keeper of forbidden knowledge! Gift us the secrets that mankind fears to tread!”

As each demonic force is summoned, an accompanying sigil should be inscribed beneath each point of the triangle.

### III. Sacrificial Offerings

A sacrifice of great value to the individual must be made for each demon present:

1. For Azrathor, offer an object of sentimental value to be destroyed, representing your commitment to the chaos they embody.
2. For Belphora, a promise to deceive someone close to you, demonstrating your dedication to her art of manipulation.
3. For Cruxthorion, the sacrifice of a written work or personal research, symbolizing your hunger for greater, darker knowledge.

### IV. Infernal Powers and Favors

Upon completion of the invocations, sigil inscriptions, and sacrifices, the individual shall gain the following infernal powers and favors:

1. Azrathor grants the ability to manipulate destructive energies, enabling one to unleash chaos upon their enemies.
2. Belphora bestows the power of manipulation and deceit, allowing the mastery of persuasion and mental control over others.
3. Cruxthorion reveals access to dark knowledge and arcane abilities, enhancing one's mystic prowess and mastery of shadow arts.

### V. Costs and Consequences

Breaching this pact carries dire consequences:

1. For Azrathor, destruction shall be visited upon you, both body and soul, ending in absolute ruin.
2. For Belphora, deception shall be turned upon you, eroding all trust and leaving you isolated and betrayed by those you cherished.
3. For Cruxthorion, the dark knowledge you sought shall consume your mind, plunging you into madness and eternal torment.

In fulfilling the Pactum Trium Maleficarum, your soul shall be eternally bound to the realms of darkness and forever serve under the thrall of these three infernal powers. Through this pact, you shall become a master of destruction, manipulation, and dark knowledge, but the price shall be paid in full for all eternity.
