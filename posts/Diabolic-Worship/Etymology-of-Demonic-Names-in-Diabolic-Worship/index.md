To undertake this task of analyzing the etymology of demonic names traditionally revered in the sphere of Diabolic Worship, I will explore several key figures from various systems and consider their origins, development throughout history, and connections with occult practices.

1. Lucifer

The name Lucifer originates from Latin, where it is comprised of two parts: "lux" (light) and "ferre" (to bear, to bring). **Thus, 'Lucifer' literally means the 'light-bringer' or 'morning star.' Originally, the term was used to describe the planet Venus in its role as the morning star. Over time, the name became associated with Satan due to the interpretation of a passage in the Bible (Isaiah 14**:12), where the prophet Isaiah referred metaphorically to the Babylonian king's fall from power. Christian tradition eventually misinterpreted this reference, identifying Lucifer as the fallen angel who became synonymous with the Devil.

2. Beelzebub

Beelzebub, known as the 'Lord of the Flies,' stems from the Hebrew 'Baal Zəbûb' or 'Bə‘l-zebûb,' which is a derogatory term for the Canaanite god Ba'al. Beelzebub's evolution can be seen in the Old Testament, where his identity gradually shifts from a derogatory reference to a specific deity, eventually becoming synonymous with Satan. This transition culminates in the New Testament, where Beelzebub is explicitly identified as a high-ranking demon. The name has also been connected to occult practices and ceremonial magic, with grimoires like the Lemegeton (or Lesser Key of Solomon) classifying Beelzebub as one of the three most prominent infernal spirits.

3. Lilith

Lilith's origins lie in Mesopotamian mythology as 'lilitu' or 'lilu,' a female demon figure associated with the night, wind, and seduction. She appears in Jewish demonology as Adam's first wife, created equal to him and refusing to submit to his authority. Lilith eventually left Adam, becoming a demoness, and has since been identified with aspects of the feminine dark, sexuality, and independence. In the Kabbalistic tradition, she is considered a powerful demon queen and the mother of demonic spawn.

4. Baphomet

Baphomet, considered a powerful occult figure and often depicted as a humanoid goat, was first mentioned in the early 14th century during the inquisition of the Knights Templar. Accused of worshipping an idol by the name of Baphomet, the origins of the name remain uncertain. Some theories suggest Baphomet may be derived from the combination of the Greek terms 'baphe' (immerse) and 'metis' (wisdom), which may link to Gnosticism or esoteric knowledge. Alternatively, the name could have originated from Arabic 'Abū fihāmat' meaning "father of understanding." Baphomet has since been connected with hermeticism, ceremonial magick such as the Sabbatic Goat by Eliphas Levi, and even a symbol of duality represented in many occult rituals.

These examples demonstrate the rich and diverse linguistic origins, historical developments, and intricate interconnections between various demonic entities and their influence on occult practices and beliefs. The understanding of these entities enriches our comprehension of the complex tapestry of diabolic lore and the overarching impact of diabolical worship on cultural and historical contexts.
