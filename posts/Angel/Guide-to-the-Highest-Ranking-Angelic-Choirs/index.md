The answer is: Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones.

In the context of occult practices and angelic hierarchies, the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones are traditionally associated with providing divine illumination and guiding human spiritual evolution. This association stems from the classification of angels presented by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 5th-century Christian theologian, in his work "The Celestial Hierarchy." 

According to Pseudo-Dionysius, the angelic hierarchy is divided into three triads, each containing three orders or choirs. **This hierarchy is as follows**:

1. **First Triad**: Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones
2. **Second Triad**: Dominions, Virtues, and Powers
3. **Third Triad**: Principalities, Archangels, and Angels

The First Triad, consisting of the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones, is considered the highest-ranking in the hierarchy and is closest to the Divine. These angels are responsible for maintaining a direct connection with God and transmitting this divine illumination down through the ranks to the lower orders and eventually to humanity. Because of their role in transmitting divine knowledge and guidance, these top three angelic choirs are often called the "Counselors" or the "Illuminators."

The Seraphim are considered the highest-ranking angels, representing pure love, light, and the divine fire of God. They are said to surround the Throne of God and maintain a state of perpetual worship and adoration.

The Cherubim, the second-highest order of angels, are responsible for guarding divine wisdom and the knowledge of God. They are often depicted as having a multitude of eyes, indicating their ability to see and understand all things.

The Thrones, third in rank, symbolize divine justice and authority. They are said to be the foundation and support for the divine throne, representing the stability and balance required for spiritual evolution.

In the context of occult practices, working with these angelic hierarchies involves invoking their energies and guidance to help one gain deeper spiritual insights, understanding, and enlightenment. These angels can be thought of as spiritual role models or intermediaries, bringing the divine illumination necessary for human spiritual evolution.

In conclusion, the Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones are the angelic hierarchies most closely associated with divine illumination and guiding human spiritual evolution. By understanding the roles and symbolism of these angelic orders within the greater celestial hierarchy, practitioners of the esoteric and occult can better engage with and appreciate the process of spiritual evolution and growth.
