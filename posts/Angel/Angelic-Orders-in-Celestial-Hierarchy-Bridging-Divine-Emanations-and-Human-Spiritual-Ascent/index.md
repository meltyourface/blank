Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy: Connection Between Angelic Orders and Divine Emanations and Their Influence on Human Spiritual Ascent

Introduction:
Dionysius the Areopagite, a 6th century Christian theologian and philosopher, authored the foundational work called "Celestial Hierarchy" which explores the complex structure of the heavenly realm and the angelic beings within it. It is important to note that the authorship of this work has been debated, and the identity of Dionysius the Areopagite remains uncertain. However, the ideas and concepts presented in the Celestial Hierarchy have had a lasting influence on Christian theology and mysticism.

Connection Between Angelic Orders and Divine Emanations:
Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy is organized into three different triads, each comprising three orders or ranks. These triads reflect the structure of the heavenly realm and the divine emanations that flow from the highest source, God, down through the various angelic orders. **The three triads are**:

1. **First Triad**: Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones
2. **Second Triad**: Dominions, Virtues, and Powers
3. **Third Triad**: Principalities, Archangels, and Angels

Dionysius sees the divine emanations as a process of outflowing and return, whereby each level of the hierarchy participates in the divine light and transmits it to the levels below. This can be likened to a celestial game of "Chinese whispers," except that the message passed on remains uncorrupted and undiluted.

The purpose of the angelic orders in the celestial hierarchy is to act as intermediaries, messengers, and protective spirits that maintain a harmonious connection between God and creation, as well as guiding and facilitating the process of spiritual ascent for human beings.

Influence of Angelic Orders on Human Spiritual Ascent:

1. **Intermediaries**: One of the main functions of the angelic orders is to bridge the gap between God and creation, channeling divine grace and wisdom to the lower levels of existence. This is crucial for human spiritual progression, as it provides a pathway for humans to draw closer to God by allowing them to experience and comprehend the divine aspects more fully.

2. **Messengers**: The angelic orders communicate the divine will to humans and other beings, helping them to understand and align with the divine plan. By conveying heavenly wisdom and guidance, angels encourage and inspire humans to strive for spiritual growth and enlightenment.

3. **Protective Spirits**: The angelic orders also serve as guardians, watching over humans and their spiritual journey. They protect individuals from evil forces or lesser beings that could hinder their progress and provide support and encouragement throughout their ascent.

Conclusion:
Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy expounds on the multi-layered connection between angelic orders and divine emanations. The hierarchy, organized into triads, ensures that God's divine light is transmitted and shared among all orders, reflecting their interconnectedness. Angels play active roles as intermediaries, messengers, and protective spirits that influence and facilitate human spiritual ascent. By fostering a deeper understanding of the celestial realm, Dionysius' description of the angelic orders serves as an important foundation for understanding Christian mysticism and theology.
