Task: Develop a comprehensive Shamanic-style ritual for the secure expulsion of detrimental and undesirable energies.

**Ritual Name**: The Rite of Purification and Rebalancing

**Objective**: To expel detrimental and undesirable energies from a person, place, or object, and restore balance to the surrounding energies while ensuring the practitioner's safety.

**Components**:
1. Sacred Herbs - White Sage, Cedar, and Sweetgrass
2. Crystals - Black Tourmaline, Selenite, and Hematite
3. Sigils - Sigil of Banishment, Sigil of Elemental Protection, Sigil of Balance
4. Chanted Incantations - The Call of the Elements, The Incantation of Expulsion, The Song of Harmony and Protection
5. Ritual Tools - Feather Wand, Smudge Bowl, and Ritual Drum

**Preparation**:
**Step 1**: Cleanse the area and yourself physically and spiritually. Sweep and wash the floor, bathe, and wear clean, loose clothing. This opens the pathway for change.
**Step 2**: Place the Sigil of Elemental Protection in each of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) to create a protective barrier.
**Step 3**: Arrange the crystals in their respective positions. Place Black Tourmaline and Selenite at the entrance to create a protective boundary. Distribute Hematite around the perimeter to ground the energies.
**Step 4**: Light the sacred herbs in the smudge bowl, allowing them to smolder and release their cleansing smoke.

The Ritual:

### Part 1 - Calling the Elements
Chant the Call of the Elements aloud to invoke their power and protection:

"Earth, steady and strong,
Air, bring clarity where things went wrong,
Fire, burn away that which harms,
Water, cleanse and bring calm."

### Part 2 - Expelling Detrimental Energies
Draw the Sigil of Banishment in the air with the feather wand while reciting the Incantation of Expulsion:

"By the power of the sacred elements joined,
Unwanted energies, be now destroyed.
Banished and gone, never to return,
Purity and harmony now hold firm."

Walk clockwise around the space while waving the smudge bowl, allowing the smoke to envelop the person or object being cleansed.

### Part 3 - Restoring Balance and Protection
Draw the Sigil of Balance in the air with the feather wand and chant the Song of Harmony and Protection:

"Balance is now restored, a circle strong and true,
No harm shall come within, only good shall pass through.
Protected and shielded, we stand our ground,
In peace and harmony, we are now bound."

Beat the ritual drum to signal the end of the ceremony and the sealing of the energetic space.

**Aftercare**:
**Step 1**: Ground yourself by touching the earth, eating a small meal, or performing a grounding visualization.
**Step 2**: Thank the elements for their assistance and release them from the ritual space.
**Step 3**: Discard or bury the ashes from the sacred herbs, symbolizing the release of the expelled energies back to the earth.
**Step 4**: Cleanse the crystals and sigils to prepare for future use.

With practice and thorough preparation, The Rite of Purification and Rebalancing can serve as an effective method for expelling detrimental and undesirable energies, ensuring the practitioner's safety, and maintaining the balance of surrounding energies during the process.
