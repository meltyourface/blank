To call forth the exalted air elemental, Vhaerun, from the hidden arcane realm of Zothyria, one must adhere to an intricate Zothyrian ceremony. This ritual is highly complex and requires flawless attention to detail to successfully complete.

Ritual Components:

1. **Ancient Sigils**: The Sigil of Vhaerun, which depicts a whirlwind intertwined with an intricate geometric pattern, must be inscribed upon a smooth stone tablet with a silver chisel. Additionally, the Summoner's Circles, representing the four cardinal points, will surround the Sigil of Vhaerun and should be etched into the ground using a wand made of elder wood.
 
2. **Sacred Incantations**: The Zothyrian Invocation of Vhaerun must be chanted. This arcane tome, written in the arcane language of Aethyros, holds the key to calling forth the air elemental. The summoner should be proficient in Aethyros for the invocation to remain pure and effective.

3. **Ceremonial Objects**: Four elemental crystals representing Air, Fire, Water, and Earth must be placed at each of the cardinal points within the Summoner's Circles. Additionally, a chalice filled with clear water, a burning censer, and a statuette made of green aventurine are necessary to anchor the elemental's essence.

Optimal Conditions:

1. **Lunar Phase**: The Waxing Gibbous phase is ideal for this ceremony as the energy of the moon is growing stronger and will help bolster the mystical energies necessary to summon Vhaerun.

2. **Celestial Alignments**: The ethereal constellation of Anz√∫a, which represents the divine harmony of cosmic forces, must be rising in the eastern sky at the time of the ceremony.

3. **Atmospheric Conditions**: A gentle breeze flowing from the west, symbolizing the presence of air, must be present during the entirety of the ceremony. Complete the ritual on a high summit or on a hilltop for the best atmospheric conditions.

Gestures, Movements, and Chants:

1. **Symbolic Gestures**: The summoner must make fluid, sweeping gestures with their arms, mimicking the movements of air currents, during the incantation. When starting and concluding the ritual, the summoner must hold their hands above their head, fingers interlocked, and bow thrice to each cardinal point, acknowledging the elemental forces.

2. **Ritual Movements**: The summoner will circumambulate the Sigil of Vhaerun in a clockwise direction, pausing at each elemental crystal to draw empowering sigils in the air with the elder wood wand.

3. **Resonant Chants**: Throughout the ceremony, a choir of Aethyros-proficient practitioners aligns in a circle outside the Summoner's Circles to intone the Zothyrian Hymn of the Elements. Their resonant chanting will amplify the mystical energies required to bridge the realms and bind the conjured Vhaerun to the summoner's intent.

By precisely adhering to each aspect of the ceremonial procedure, the summoner will call forth Vhaerun from the arcane realm of Zothyria and bind the air elemental's vast powers to their command. Remember that, with great power comes great responsibility, and Zothyrian practitioners must always use their abilities in accordance with the ancient laws that govern the esoteric arts.
