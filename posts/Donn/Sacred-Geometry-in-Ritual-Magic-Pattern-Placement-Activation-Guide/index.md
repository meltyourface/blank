You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Devise an in-depth procedure for incorporating specific sacred geometrical patterns, such as the Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube, or Sri Yantra, into ritualistic magic practices by outlining their placement, usage, and connection to particular intentions or energies.

Task: Incorporate specific sacred geometrical patterns (Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube, and Sri Yantra) into ritualistic magic practices by outlining their placement, usage, and connection to particular intentions or energies. Elaborate on the consecration process and the specific tools or materials needed for the configuration and amplification of these sacred geometries during invocation, evocation, or divination rituals.

1. Selection and Intention: Begin by selecting one of the sacred geometrical patterns to incorporate into your ritual. The pattern you choose should be resonant with the intention or magical working you wish to perform. For example:

   - Flower of Life: Associated with creation, unity, and the interconnectedness of all living things.
   - Metatron's Cube: Represents divine power, knowledge, and organization. 
   - Sri Yantra: Linked to the manifestation of desires, spiritual enlightenment, and inner transformation.

2. Preparation and Setup: Prepare your ritual space by cleansing it with purifying elements such as sage, incense, or saltwater. Obtain a representation of your chosen sacred geometrical pattern. This can be a physical representation like a wooden or crystal grid, or a drawn or printed image. You will also need:

   - A compass or ruler for proper placement and alignment.
   - A set of crystals, candles, or other ritualistic items associated with your intention.
   - An offering to the energies or deities you are working with.
   - Any additional ritualistic items specific to your practice, such as an athame, chalice, or wand.

3. Consecration: Consecrate your sacred geometrical pattern representation using a method appropriate to your practice or tradition. This might involve anointing it with sacred oils, sprinkling it with holy water, or imbuing it with intention through focused meditation and visualization.

4. Placement and Activation: Arrange your chosen sacred geometrical pattern within your ritual space to align with the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) as appropriate, using the compass or ruler for precise alignment. Place the crystals, candles, or other ritualistic items at strategic points on the pattern to amplify its power and connect with the specific energies or intentions you're working with.

5. Invocation, Evocation, or Divination: Perform your chosen ritual, whether it's invoking a particular energy or deity, evoking a magical entity, or conducting a divination to gain insight or guidance. As you work, visualize the energies flowing through the sacred geometry pattern, converging at the center and radiating outward to fulfill your intention.

6. Offering and Gratitude: Present your offering to the energies or deities you have worked with and express gratitude for their assistance in the ritual. This will help to solidify the connection and create a stronger bond for future magical workings.

7. Closing the Ritual: Once your ritual is complete, it is essential to close the sacred space and energetically release the pattern. This can be done through a simple visualization, grounding exercise, or spoken words of release. Take down the sacred geometrical pattern and store it properly, as well as any other ritual tools or materials used.

By following this in-depth procedure, you can effectively incorporate the power of sacred geometrical patterns into your magical practice, enhancing your intention, connection, and results.
