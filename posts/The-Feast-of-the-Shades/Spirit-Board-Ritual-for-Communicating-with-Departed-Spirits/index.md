excerpt: >

  1. ****Assemble sacred materials****: Acquire a wooden board of substantial size, marking tools rich in dark pigment, and a planchette composed of precious materials, its shape crafted to enhance psychic sensitivity.

  2. Intimately familiarize yourself with the ancient symbology associated with The Feast of the Shades; carefully research arcane glyphs used to invoke the spirits during this abstruse event.

  3. Immerse yourself in the rites and methodologies practiced by adept sorcerers, honing your skills in the incorporeal arts, ensuring an immersive and potent experience.

  4. On the wooden board, inscribe a circular arrangement of the alphabet, highlighted by the powerful shades-invoking runes specific to The Feast of the Shades. Take great care in positioning these mystical symbols to ensure their channels of energy are unobstructed.

  5. Beneath this circle, manifest the numbers 0 through 9 using numerals riddled with hidden occult meanings and geometric patterns resonating with the spectral vibrations.

  6. Add an ethereal visual focal point at the top-center of the board; this could be a sigil, a symbol, or artistic representation of the shades that bewitchingly entwines the energies released during The Feast of the Shades.

  7. Surround the board's edges with esoteric phrases or invocations in an archaic language reminiscent of The Feast of the Shades epoch, heightening the spiritual connection during the spirit board session.

  8. As a finishing touch, anoint the completed Spirit Board and planchette with a blend of sacred oils aligned with the intent of communing with shades during The Feast of the Shades.

  9. Prepare the ritual space by adorning it with artifacts, relics, and offerings that will appease the shades and ensure a harmonious exchange during the board's unveiling at The Feast of the Shades.

10. Before employing the Spirit Board during The Feast of the Shades, purify the ritual space by burning cleansing herbs such as sage, palo santo, or frankincense. Encircle the area with salt or protective crystals to create a barrier against malevolent entities.

11. With the sacred space properly prepared, gather all participants around the board. Each participant should anoint themselves with the same sacred oils used on the Spirit Board and planchette, aligning their energies to those of the board.

12. Center the group by leading them through a brief meditation, focusing on establishing a collective psychic connection and setting their intentions for communing with the shades.

13. Begin the ritual by reciting the esoteric phrases and invocations inscribed on the Spirit Board edges in unison. This act summons the energies of The Feast of the Shades and opens a channel for the shades to communicate.

14. Place your hands and the hands of the other participants on the planchette. Request the presence of the desired shades by speaking their names, inviting them to join you during The Feast of the Shades.

15. As the planchette moves under the guidance of the shades, respect the ephemeral nature of this communion by asking meaningful questions. Record the messages received by noting the planchette's movements across the board, documenting the spectral wisdom gained during the ritual.

16. Once communication has been completed, close the ceremony by expressing gratitude to the shades and kindly asking them to depart. Recite a closing incantation that seals off the portal and restores balance to the space.

17. Safely extinguish any ceremonial fires and cleanse the Spirit Board and planchette with a cleansing solution of water and sacred salt. Store the Spirit Board and planchette in a protective covering until their use during the next Feast of the Shades.

Throughout the completion of each step in crafting and engaging with the Spirit Board, abide by the solemn principles of The Feast of the Shades. Embrace the cosmic knowledge acquired during this sacred event and use it to further your mastery of the esoteric arts.
