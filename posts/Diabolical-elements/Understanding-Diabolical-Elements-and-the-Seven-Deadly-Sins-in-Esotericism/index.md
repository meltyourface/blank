Introduction:
In order to address this knowledge challenge, we need to first understand the concept of Diabolical elements, the seven deadly sins, and their origins and relevance in the context of occult symbolism. Then, we will delve into examples of how these connections manifest within esoteric practices and the psychological dimensions of human experience. Let's begin by understanding each concept separately, and then proceed to explore their connections.

Diabolical Elements:
Diabolical elements refer to those aspects or symbols in the esoteric and occult traditions that are associated with the darker, malevolent forces within the universe. These elements represent the dualistic nature of the cosmos, where good and evil continually interact and shape human existence. In this context, the Diabolical elements signify the contrasting forces, typically ones that lean towards chaos and disorder.

Seven Deadly Sins:
The seven deadly sins, also known as the cardinal sins, are a classification of vices in Christian teachings that are considered to be particularly dangerous to one's spiritual growth, as they lead to moral corruption and separation from God. The seven sins include Pride, Greed, Wrath, Envy, Lust, Gluttony, and Sloth. These sins are thought to arise from human weakness and corrupt the soul, ultimately leading to eternal damnation if left unchecked.

Occult Symbolism:
Occultism, as a practice and belief system, delves into the exploration of hidden knowledge and the pursuit of spiritual truths that go beyond the observable, material world. Occult symbolism involves utilizing various symbols, rituals, and practices to gain a deeper understanding of the metaphysical realm and the underlying principles that govern the cosmos.

**Connections**:
Now that we have a basic understanding of these concepts, let's explore the connections between the Diabolical elements and the seven deadly sins in the context of occult symbolism. **Several esoteric traditions maintain that the earthly manifestations of the seven deadly sins are directly associated with specific malevolent forces or entities**:

1. **Pride**: Associated with Lucifer or the Morning Star, Pride is often symbolized by a peacock or a lion, representing the ego and self-centeredness that come with this vice. In many occult practices, the overcoming of pride is seen as a crucial step in spiritual growth, as an inflated ego can hinder the realization of one's true self.

2. **Greed**: Mammon, the demon of wealth and accumulation, is linked to the sin of Greed, which often manifests as an insatiable desire for material possessions. In esoteric practices, practitioners work towards detaching themselves from worldly wants and cultivating a sense of contentment and gratitude.

3. **Wrath**: Depicted by the demon Amon or the deity Mars, Wrath is a symbol of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Esoteric teachings often encourage the practitioner to embrace forgiveness, compassion, and inner peace to counteract the destructive consequences of this vice.

4. **Envy**: Corresponding to the demon Leviathan, Envy signifies an overwhelming desire for what others possess and the resentment that ensues. Occult practices teach the importance of self-acceptance and discovering one's own talents and potential, rather than focusing on comparisons.

5. **Lust**: Asmodeus, the demon of lust, represents the excessive passion and carnal desires that obscure one's spiritual growth. Esoteric practices often emphasize chastity, mindfulness, and self-control as key aspects of overcoming this vice.

6. **Gluttony**: The demon Beelzebub, or the entity Belphegor, is associated with the sin of Gluttony, which stands for overindulgence and selfishness. In occult practices, moderation and balance are encouraged to counteract the negative effects of this vice.

7. **Sloth**: Belphegor, known for seducing people through laziness, is also connected to the sin of Sloth, embodying spiritual negligence and inertia. Esoteric teachings highlight the importance of discipline, commitment, and action as means to progress in one's spiritual journey.

**Conclusion**:
In summary, the connections between the Diabolical elements and the seven deadly sins in the context of occult symbolism lie within the understanding that these malevolent forces and vices are intertwined and shape human experience. By recognizing these detrimental tendencies and working towards overcoming them through esoteric practices, individuals can delve deeper into their spiritual growth and attain a higher state of self-awareness.
