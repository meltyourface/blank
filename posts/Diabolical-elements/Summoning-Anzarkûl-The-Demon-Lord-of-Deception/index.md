## Grimoire of Anzarkûl

Description:

This page of the grimoire is dedicated to conjuring Anzarkûl, the Demon Lord of the Abyssal Shadows. Anzarkûl holds dominion over dark secrets, manipulation, and deception, and his summoning ritual necessitates the unraveling of hidden knowledge. Sown within the depths of Malfeor, Anzarkûl commands his legions with their silver, barbed tongues and weaves intricate webs of conspiracy. Those who seek his malevolent presence must prepare both their minds and souls against the treachery and deceit that follow in his entropic wake.

Sigil:

Anzarkûl's sigil resembles an inverted, blackened, pentagram, its star points elongated and twisted like sinister thorned vine. Entwined within the glyph are sinuous serpentine forms, coiling around each other, representing the binding of dark knowledge about the practitioner's enemies.

Occult Correspondences:

- Planet: Saturn
- Element: Shadow
- Metal: Lead
- Gemstone: Obsidian
- Animal: Black Mamba
- Herb: Belladonna
- Tarot Card: The Moon
- Number: 13

Nefarious Intentions:

Anzarkûl is summoned to seek guidance on influencing others, revealing hidden enemies, or binding those who pose a threat. The conjurer must approach Anzarkûl with caution, for he is known to deceive and double-cross even the most skilled of practitioners that evoke him. Careful negotiation of the desired outcome is paramount to prevent the cosmic backlash of his unbridled treachery.

Summoning Ritual:

Tools required: 

- Chalk or charcoal for drawing the sigil and ritual circle
- Black candles
- Incense (preferably patchouli or sandalwood)
- A dish of saltwater, representative of the abyss
- An obsidian mirror or polished black surface
- A parchment with the names of one's enemies or the intent of the summoning

Procedure:

1. Choose a secluded location devoid of light or earthly distractions.
2. Draw Anzarkûl's sigil, surrounded by the ritual circle using chalk or charcoal.
3. Place an unlit black candle at each point of the inverted pentagram.
4. Light the incense and let the smoke permeate the ritual area.
5. Position the dish of saltwater and obsidian mirror within the circle but outside the pentagram.
6. Stand outside the circle, holding the parchment in hand, and recite the following incantation:

   "Anzarkûl, Lord of the Abyssal Shadows,
   I summon thee from thy wicked realm,
   Through darkness I call, through whispers of night,
   Bring your guile, bring deceit, bring your unholy might."

7. Ignite the parchment and cast it into the saltwater.
8. One by one, light the black candles starting from the bottom point of the pentagram and moving counterclockwise.
9. Gaze upon the obsidian mirror, focusing on Anzarkûl's sigil. Prepare for a vision, and wait for the demon lord's presence.
10. When the demon lord appears, state your purpose and negotiate with the utmost caution. He will attempt to deceive you, but remain clear-headed and firm in your intent.
11. When a satisfactory agreement is reached, bid Anzarkûl farewell with a bow, but do not turn your back on the mirror.

Entropic Consequences:

Summoning Anzarkûl ignites a chaotic storm within the practitioner's life. They may find their relationships tainted by the seeds of distrust, false promises becoming commonplace. Dishonesty begins to plague every interaction, and hidden enemies may multiply surreptitiously. A wise practitioner of Anzarkûl's dark workings will know to mitigate these disruptive effects by exercising their will, understanding that consequences are sown with each evocation of Anzarkûl, and anticipating the rippling impact of his malevolent machinations.
