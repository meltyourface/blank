## An Exploration of the Sublime Emerald Tablet within the Occult Context of Mary Anne Atwood

Introduction

Mary Anne Atwood (1817-1910) was a prominent figure in the esoteric and occult scene of the 19th century due to her influential work A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery. However, while A Suggestive Inquiry received wide recognition, several underexplored texts of Atwood's have yet to be given the attention they deserve. One such work is her analysis and interpretation of the Sublime Emerald Tablet. In this paper, we will conduct a comprehensive, annotated analysis of Atwood's take on this esoteric text and examine its occult significance, the connections to hermetic philosophy, the influence of her father's teachings, and compare it to her widely recognized literature.

Occult Significance

Mary Anne Atwood's interpretation of the Sublime Emerald Tablet revolves around the concept of spiritual alchemy. The Sublime Emerald Tablet, traditionally attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, is an essential text in the Hermetic tradition, which Atwood deeply connected with the process of inner transformation.

In her analysis, Atwood writes, "The Tablet is the blueprint of the secret fire, the divine spark hidden within each of us, awaiting to be unveiled, nurtured, and transmuted into a self-refulgent gem." This interpretation shows the occult significance of the text, as it outlines the spiritual process of awakening, purifying, and elevating the seeker's consciousness.

Hermetic Philosophy

Atwood's understanding of the Sublime Emerald Tablet is firmly rooted in hermetic philosophy, particularly its emphasis on the interconnectedness of all things and the microcosm-macrocosm relationship. In her commentary, she emphasizes the notion of "As above, so below," which states that the processes occurring in the universe are also reflected within the individual.

For instance, Atwood explores the alchemical process of turning base metals into gold, drawing parallels between it and the transformation of the human soul. She writes, "The transmutation of base metals into gold does not simply occur in the external realm; it represents a profound internal transformation, one in which we become aware of our divine nature and achieve enlightenment â€“ the true alchemical gold."

Influence of Her Father's Teachings

Atwood's father, Thomas South, was a significant influence on her work, particularly in his steadfast commitment to hermetic and alchemical traditions. ****In her interpretation of the Sublime Emerald Tablet, Atwood often refers to her father's ideas on the three principles of alchemy****: Salt, Mercury, and Sulfur. These principles relate to the body, mind, and spirit, respectively.

Atwood builds on her father's ideas by applying these principles to her analysis, writing that "The unity and synthesis of these three principles within the human being lead to the manifestation of the Divine, resulting in the attainment of the Philosopher's Stone."

Comparison to A Suggestive Inquiry

Although both A Suggestive Inquiry and the Sublime Emerald Tablet analysis share a core focus on hermeticism and spirituality, Atwood's treatment of the material in the latter text is far more in-depth and nuanced. While A Suggestive Inquiry serves as an introductory text on the hermetic mysteries, her analysis of the Sublime Emerald Tablet delves deeply into more esoteric aspects and offers a more targeted, context-specific exploration.

For example, in A Suggestive Inquiry, Atwood writes, "The true philosopher is the one who, leaving behind the dross and imperfections of the world, ascends by the steps of divine wisdom in pursuit of the eternal light." In comparison, her analysis of the Sublime Emerald Tablet states, "The ascent to divine wisdom is not a linear process but rather a spiral, in which one continually delves into the depths of one's being to remove the layers of ignorance and impurity, ultimately arriving at a purified state of divine revelation."

Conclusion

Through her annotated analysis of the Sublime Emerald Tablet, Mary Anne Atwood offers valuable insights into the intricacies of the hermetic and alchemical traditions. This text, though lesser-known compared to A Suggestive Inquiry, reveals a profound depth, nuance, and impact that significantly enriches our understanding of her esoteric knowledge and authority. Her exploration of the Tablet's occult significance, connections to hermetic philosophy, and the influence of her father's teachings demonstrate her exceptional understanding of the subject, which should not be overlooked.
