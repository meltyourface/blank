Upon the waters gleaming, boats afloat with hues of dreams,
As chimes of bells and strum of strings with melody they beam.
In Market Harborough lies the heart of this joyous scene,
Where art and sailing vessels dance, embraced as lover's team.

Each buoyant craft adorned in shades of crimson, blue, and gold,
A pageant woven 'neath the skies, their stories deftly told.
The strokes of color seize the soul, upon the canvas bold,
And sculptures rise like monuments, as if by giants, rolled.

The music streams from shore divine, of fiddles, drums, and lyre,
As artists ply their noble trade, and craftsmen stoke the fire.
In serenade, the melody transcends to notes much higher,
A symphony entwined with art, a feast for the inspired.

Oh, Harborough Festival divine, your spirit shall endure,
A testament to boat and art, your legacy, a treasure pure.
