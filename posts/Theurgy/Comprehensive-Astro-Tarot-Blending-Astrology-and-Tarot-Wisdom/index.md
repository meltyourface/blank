- Start the spread by shuffling the deck.
- Lay out the twelve cards clockwise, starting at the 9th house and moving towards the 8th, to mimic a horoscope wheel.
- Place the central card last, representing the querent's energy.
- Interpret each card and the overall energy through the lens of the associated astrological houses.

Choose a querent with a known horoscope to perform an Astro-Tarot reading. Draw their natal chart, analyzing planetary placements and aspects to have a deeper understanding of their celestial blueprint.

Perform a reading using the Astro-Tarot Spread, while considering the astrology elements discussed in steps 1 to 3. Offer insights into various areas of life through the combination of celestial influences and the Tarot's symbolism. Note any significant planetary indications (e.g., retrogrades, transits) that could inform the reading.
