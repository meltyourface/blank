  Analyze the Tree of Life and its significance in Hermetic Qabalah, taking into account both Pagan and Gnostic teachings, decipher three potential ways a theurgic ritual could be performed to invoke and manifest the divine within an Initiate - providing a nuanced comparison that spotlights their philosophical and practical differences.

In order to answer this challenge, we must first contextualize the Tree of Life within the framework of Hermetic Qabalah, which combines elements of Jewish Kabbalah, Gnosticism, and pagan beliefs. The Tree of Life, also known as Etz HaChayim, is a diagram comprising ten interconnected spheres, or Sephiroth, which represent the various aspects of God and the manifestation of the cosmos. The Tree is also divided into three pillars and four worlds, each with its specific attributes and functions. The process of initiation into the mysteries of the Qabalah is believed to unlock divine insight and self-realization.

Having established that, we now delve into three theurgic rituals that can be performed to invoke and manifest the divine within an Initiate.

1. **Ladder of Lights/Pathworking**:
The Ladder of Lights (Jacob's Ladder) is a practical technique used in Qabalah to climb the Tree of Life and access each Sephirah. The ritual utilizes meditation and visualization of a path connecting each Sephirah, starting at the bottom and working upward to unite with the source. In pagan teachings, the ascent represents the Initiate's journey to self-discovery and wisdom, akin to the myth of the ascent from the underworld. In Gnostic beliefs, the idea of ascent is embodied in the myth of Sophia, who fell from her divine realm and must rise again by reconnecting with her higher self. Despite the similarities in philosophy, the pagan approach may emphasize nature and mythological symbols, whereas Gnosticism may highlight redemption and emanation of divine light.

2. **Invoking the Divine Names**:
Theurgy in Qabalah makes use of invoking the divine names attributed to each Sephirah. In this ritual, the Initiate combines prayer, mantra, and visualization to establish a connection to that specific attribute of the divine, seeking to integrate it into their self. Pagan teachings may employ the use of elemental, astrological, and planetary associations for invocation, including the gods and goddesses of various pantheons. In contrast, Gnosticism emphasizes the hierarchies of Aeons, emanations of the ultimate divine source, as well as archangels associated with each Sephirah. The practical differences lie in the choice of symbolism and divine entities invoked, but the ultimate goal of attaining unity with the divine remains the same.

3. **Rituals of Lesser and Greater Banishing & Invoking**:
These rituals are meant to cleanse, consecrate, and align oneself with the energies of the Tree of Life. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) involves invoking the divine names, directing energy by drawing specific sigils and symbols, and calling upon archangels for their protection. The Greater Rituals of the Pentagram delve deeper into the particular aspects of the Tree, invoking or banishing the energies of a specific Sephirah. In pagan practices, this may be done using tools such as athames, wands, and invoking deities in tune with nature and elemental forces. In Gnostic rituals, the emphasis may fall upon direct communion with the divine, detaching from the material world and igniting the divine spark within. The philosophical difference lies in the pagan focus on elemental and nature-based deities, whereas Gnosticism places a greater emphasis on redemption, ascension, and direct communion with the divine source.

In conclusion, the Tree of Life in Hermetic Qabalah is a potent framework for understanding and manifesting the divine within an Initiate. The three theurgic rituals discussed - the Ladder of Lights, invoking the Divine Names, and Banishing & Invoking rituals - share a core goal of uniting the Initiate with the divine. However, their philosophical and practical differences emerge mainly in the choice of symbols and entities used to bridge this connection, informed by the cultural and spiritual underpinnings of pagan and Gnostic teachings. Nonetheless, each ritual offers a unique and complementary path to achieving self-realization and glimpsing the unity of the cosmos.
