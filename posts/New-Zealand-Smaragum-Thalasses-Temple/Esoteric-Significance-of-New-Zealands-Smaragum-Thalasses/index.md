"Smaragum Thalasses," an evocative phrase derived from the Greek words "smaragdus" (emerald) and "thalassa" (sea), denotes the richly vibrant natural environment and the deep, mystical connection with the coastal locations of New Zealand. The term characterizes the stunning, emerald-hued seas surrounding the island nation and emphasizes the profound spiritual qualities imbued within its landscape. In the context of the esoteric aspects of New Zealand's geography, "Smaragum Thalasses" signifies the significant interplay between the mystical wisdom of nature, local traditions, and the shared spiritual endeavors of its inhabitants.

Throughout history, the indigenous Māori people have fostered an intricate, nature-centric belief system, as evidenced by their spiritual practices and creation myths, which are intrinsically connected to the land and sea. According to Māori tradition, Papatūānuku (the Earth Mother) and Ranginui (the Sky Father) are the primal parents who nurture and protect the world and its inhabitants. This notion embeds a profound sense of interconnectedness between the physical environment, cosmic forces, and humanity.

New Zealand's geography and "Smaragum Thalasses" concept consequently highlight the deeper esoteric meanings and connections between these age-old traditions and the broader spiritual landscape. Its abundant natural resources, such as forests, rivers, and the emerald seas, symbolize the diverse spiritual principles integral to various mystical practices. Furthermore, New Zealand's unique landscapes, with jagged mountains juxtaposed against serene coastlines, evoke a sense of a harmonious balance between opposing energies.

To illustrate the step-by-step thinking process that leads us to decipher the esoteric significance of "Smaragum Thalasses" in relation to New Zealand's geography and spiritual attributes:

1. Identify the meaning of the term "Smaragum Thalasses" (emerald sea).
2. Explore its connection to New Zealand's natural environment and geographical features.
3. Investigate indigenous Māori teachings, spiritual practices and how nature shapes their traditions.
4. Assess the relationship between New Zealand's geography, Māori beliefs, and the esoteric significance of "Smaragum Thalasses."
5. Analyze the symbolism of the unique landscapes, such as the juxtaposition of mountains and coastlines, and how it emphasizes balance and interconnectedness.

In conclusion, the term "Smaragum Thalasses" represents the powerful link between the inherent esoteric qualities of New Zealand's remarkable geography and the deeply-held spiritual beliefs of the island's native people. Through the Emerald Seas surrounding the islands, we witness the union of spiritual wisdom with the natural world, thus elevating the connection between the nature-centric local traditions and the broader spiritual landscape. This convergence of nature and esoteric knowledge affirms the strong cultural and environmental influences on New Zealand's spiritual identity and practices.
