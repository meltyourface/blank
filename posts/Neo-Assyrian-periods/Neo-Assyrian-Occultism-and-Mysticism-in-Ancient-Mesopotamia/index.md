## Mysterium Babylon: Occultism and Esoteric Practices in the Neo-Assyrian Empire

### I. Introduction

The Neo-Assyrian period (911-612 BCE) was marked by the revitalization and expansion of the Assyrian Empire, which led to an unprecedented flourishing of culture, arts, and sciences. Among these achievements, the esoteric and occult practices that emerged during this period have left a lasting impact on the subsequent development of mysticism and esoteric knowledge. This chapter delves into the occult practices, religious beliefs, and mystical aspects of the Neo-Assyrian period. We will explore important figures, deities, and places of power within the empire, as well as examine the cultural significance and the influence of these practices on later civilizations and the modern world of occultism.

### II. The Pantheon and Religious Beliefs

The religious beliefs of the Neo-Assyrian period were polytheistic and centered around a pantheon of deities, each with their own responsibilities and powers. Key deities included the supreme god Ashur, who was viewed as the divine embodiment of the Assyrian state, and his consort Mullissu. These two gods occupied a critical position in the Neo-Assyrian pantheon, signifying the close relationship between religion and political power in this society.

Other significant gods and goddesses of this period included the storm god Adad, the sun god Shamash, the moon god Sin, the wisdom god Nabu, and the goddess of love and fertility, Ishtar. Each of these deities held sway over specific aspects of life and their combined efforts were believed to maintain the cosmic order and ensure the welfare of the people.

### III. Occult Practices

The Neo-Assyrians believed in the power of esoteric knowledge and magical rituals to manipulate the forces of nature and influence the divine. This belief was rooted in ancient Mesopotamian incantation practices and divination systems. The following are key occult practices from this period.

1. ****Divination****: Divination was a central part of the Neo-Assyrian quest for understanding the divine will and deciphering the future. Diviners, or baru-priests, employed a variety of techniques, such as interpreting animal entrails (extispicy) or examining celestial omens (astrology). These practices enabled the Assyrians to make informed decisions and provided a basis for governance.

2. ****Incantations****: Incantations, or magical spells, played a significant role in protecting individuals from harm or evil influence. The Neo-Assyrians used a variety of incantation texts, ranging from simple charms to complex rituals, in order to invoke the power and protection of divine forces.

3. ****Magical Rituals****: The Assyrians practiced an array of magical rituals seeking to heal physical and spiritual ailments, protect their kingdom, or secure the favor of the gods. One such practice involved the creation of magic bowls inscribed with incantations designed to ward off malicious spirits.

### IV. Important Figures, Deities, and Places of Power

1. ****Ashurbanipal****: Ashurbanipal, the last great king of the Assyrian Empire, was known for his patronage of learning and the arts, resulting in the expansion of occult practices during his reign. He was also a scholar of esoteric knowledge, having amassed a vast library filled with ancient texts on various subjects, including magic, astrology, and divination.

2. ****The Temple of Nabu****: The Temple of Nabu, located in the significant city of Borsippa, was a central center of occult learning and boasted an extensive library containing magical texts and incantations. The temple was dedicated to Nabu, the god of writing and wisdom.

3. ****Nusku****: Nusku, the god of fire, played a crucial role in esoteric practices as the purifying element in rituals and incantations. His association with light made him the perfect divine ally against the forces of darkness and evil.

### V. The Lasting Impact of Neo-Assyrian Occultism

The occult practices and esoteric knowledge of the Neo-Assyrian period left a profound and lasting imprint on the civilizations that followed. Institutions like the Temple of Nabu fostered the diffusion of occult knowledge to other regions, such as Greece and Egypt, contributing to the subsequent growth of Western occultism. Additionally, the immense library of Ashurbanipal directly inspired the famous Library of Alexandria in Egypt.

In the modern world of occultism, the esoteric practices, deities, and symbols of the Neo-Assyrian period have found new life. Contemporary occultists and mystics continue to study and explore these ancient teachings, discovering profound wisdom and insight within their timeless messages. Through their ongoing relevance, the mystical secrets of the Neo-Assyrian period have solidified their place as enduring cornerstones of occult knowledge.
