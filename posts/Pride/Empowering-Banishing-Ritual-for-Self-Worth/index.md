Upon extensive research and a deep dive into various esoteric traditions, I have crafted the following powerful multi-layered banishing ritual that utilizes the energy of Pride to eliminate negative self-talk, targeting its root causes. This ritual incorporates symbols, sigils, and incantations from diverse practices to provide lasting protection and foster self-worth.

Materials:
- A clean, quiet, and uncluttered space for the ritual
- A circle (drawn on the ground or a cloth) to represent the confines of your power and protection
- A black or white candle
- A length of red thread or string
- A sigil representing self-worth and positive self-talk (designed by you or found through research)
- A sheet of parchment or paper
- An ink pen
- A mirror
- A small cloth pouch or bag

The Ritual:
1. Begin by cleansing the space you have chosen for the ritual. This can be done through burning sage, reciting a prayer, or simply airing out the area. Envision negative energy being dispelled as you do this.

2. Place the circle where you wish to perform the ritual. Stand in the center and become aware of your energy and power expanding within its confines.

3. Light the black or white candle and place it before you. As it burns, focus on the essence of Pride as an energy source. Reflect upon the strength, courage, and accomplishments this resource can instill within you.

4. Hold the red thread in your hands, repeating the following incantation three times:

   "Empower me, thread of Pride
    With self-worth and strength inside
    Undo attachments that hold me down
    Lift me from the fear I've found."

5. Place your self-worth sigil on the parchment. With the red thread, create a symbolic knot, encapsulating the negative self-talk and binding it. Place the thread in the center of the sigil.

6. Facing the mirror, recite:

   "I am a being of immense power,
    No darkness shall wither my flower,
    Within this sigil, my strength confined,
    The chains of fear now unbind."

7. Extinguish the candle and fold the parchment with the sigil and thread inside it. Place it in the cloth pouch or bag, and seal it tightly.

8. As the final step, bury the bag in the earth, symbolizing the permanent removal of negative self-talk and implantation of Pride as a source of personal strength and transformation.

Remember that transformation takes time and repetition. Performing this ritual periodically, especially during times of self-doubt, will help solidify its efficacy and maintain your inner courage. May Pride accompany you in your journey to becoming your most empowered self.
