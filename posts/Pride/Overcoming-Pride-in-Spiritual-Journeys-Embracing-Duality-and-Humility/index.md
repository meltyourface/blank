Introduction:

The seven deadly sins are a prominent theme in Christian tradition as well as within the framework of esoteric and occult teachings. Pride, considered among the deadliest of these sins, is often viewed as a potential stumbling block on a practitioner's spiritual journey. Consequently, it is essential to examine the ways in which excessive Pride might manifest within a practitioner's spiritual journey, ultimately hindering their progress, and probe into the means by which the intertwining of the ego and spiritual pursuits can be dismantled through the understanding of the duality present within oneself and the world around them.

Manifestations of Excessive Pride in the Spiritual Journey:

1. **Spiritual arrogance**: Excessive Pride within the context of occultism and spirituality may manifest in the form of spiritual arrogance. That is, practitioners may believe that they are inherently more enlightened, superior, or deserving of spiritual advancement compared to other seekers. This belief can impede their spiritual progress by refracting their focus from the core objective of inner growth to external comparisons with others.

2. **Resistance to guidance**: A prideful practitioner may develop resistance to receiving guidance from mentors or other experienced spiritualists in the field. Instead, they may become entrenched in their own perspective and opinions, ignoring the potential for learning from different viewpoints and experiences.

3. **Inflated ego**: Overconfidence in one's own spiritual achievements can lead to an inflated ego, whereby a practitioner might mistakenly assume they have reached a higher level in their pursuits, only to find themselves far from attaining it. This distorted sense of accomplishment can also cause a spiritual plateau, bringing about complacency and stagnation.

Disentangling Ego and Spiritual Pursuits through Duality:

To dismantle the interlacing of ego and spiritual pursuits, practitioners need to embrace the concept of duality inherent within themselves and the world around them. **The following three approaches can be pivotal in this regard**:

1. **Humility**: Embracing humility allows individuals to recognize the limits of their knowledge and be open to the wisdom of others. By genuinely acknowledging that spiritual growth is a never-ending journey, practitioners can begin to see their accomplishments as stepping stones, not endpoints, dismantling the intertwining of ego and spiritual pursuits.

2. **Acceptance of the Shadow Self**: Carl Jung, the Swiss psychologist, introduced the concept of the Shadow Self, which refers to the aspects of oneself that are often ignored or suppressed. Recognizing, accepting, and integrating the darker aspects of self, such as feelings of inadequacy and unrecognized emotions, can help practitioners become more authentic and less prideful, making the understanding of duality intrinsically tied to personal growth.

3. **Comprehending interconnectedness and unity**: By realizing the interconnectedness of all beings and acknowledging that individual spiritual paths contribute to the collective growth, practitioners can learn the importance of cooperation and collaboration instead of resorting to spiritual one-upmanship. This understanding enables them to embrace the differences in various spiritual paths while respecting the integrity of others' journeys.

**Conclusion**:

Excessive Pride within a practitioner's spiritual journey can manifest in multiple ways, including spiritual arrogance, resistance to guidance, and an inflated ego, ultimately hindering their progress. To dismantle this intertwining of ego and spiritual pursuits, it is crucial for practitioners to understand the duality present within themselves and the world around them. Embracing humility, accepting the shadow self, and comprehending the interconnectedness and unity of all beings are pivotal aspects of this process. By recognizing and integrating these approaches, practitioners can embark on a journey of continuous spiritual growth and advancement.
