In shadows deep and ancient lore,
A tale unfolds from days of yore,
Of Wild Hunt's chase and phantom throng,
Their spectral hounds and thunder's song.

From corners of the realm they came,
These enigmatic gods of fame,
In varied forms and faces clear,
Bestow their presence, drawing near.

In frozen North, Allfather stands,
One eye beholding time-worn lands,
Odin, in cloak of deepest night,
Commands the Wild Hunt's stormy flight.

In verdant isles, amidst the boughs,
Herne the Hunter whispers vows,
His curl√®d horns of twisted oak,
His voice like wind in forests spoke.

And in the hollows, dark and cold,
The Fairy Queen, her tale retold,
Among the Fae their Queen revered,
She rides her steed, their spirits seared.

Through crashing skies and teeming rain,
These fearsome riders stake their claim,
Each somber figure leads the race,
Their quarry fleeing at a frantic pace.

These mortal souls, the stories say,
Encounter Wild Hunt in horrid fray,
And meet their doom or change their fate,
As hunters close, their verdicts weighed.

The harbingers from heavens borne,
Celestial signs that chaos warn,
To mortal men a portent dire,
Foretelling storm and flood and fire.

The horses fair and hounds afield,
These spectral beasts of spectral yield,
Their eyes aglow with ember's light,
A chilling sight this eerie night.

And with the tempest, wild and free,
Their voices howling through the trees,
The Wild Hunt's charge engulfs the land,
No mortal soul can hope to stand.

Yet in the heart of mortal woe,
A seed of reverence doth grow,
For we are humbled in their wake,
Acknowledge now the powers at stake.

This haunted tale of gods and chase,
Their mythic roots, we shall embrace,
For when the night is dark and still,
We shall remember Wild Hunt's thrill.
