1. **Animal Totems Selection**:

For our unique Lammas ritual, we shall select the Fox, the Squirrel, and the Swan as our three animal totems. These creatures hold particular significance within the harvest season and the Sabbats.

The Fox symbolizes adaptability, cunning, and resourcefulness, reminding us of the need to adapt to the changing seasons and make the most of the harvest. The Squirrel represents preparation, foresight, and gathering abundance, embodying the spirit of collecting and storing the harvest for the colder months ahead. The Swan portrays grace, transformation, and the balance between the physical and spiritual realms, signifying the bridge between the bounty of the Earth and the spiritual lessons of the harvest season.

2. **Altar Creation**:

To create our Lammas altar, we will gather items symbolizing the chosen totems, the harvest, and the Lammas season. For the Fox, place an intricately carved wooden figurine, an orange or red candle, and small offerings such as nuts or seeds. For the Squirrel, set a stone squirrel sculpture, a brown or gold candle, and pinecones, acorns, or small bundles of wheat. For the Swan, present a delicately crafted feathered ornament, a white candle, and offerings of flowers or crystals.

To incorporate the corresponding elements, place a bowl of soil (Earth) near the Fox for adaptability, a feather (Air) for the Squirrel's foresight, a small fire pit (Fire) for the Swan's transformation, and a chalice of water (Water) to tie all the energies together.

3. **Animal Totem Invocation Chants**:

**Fox Totem**: "Spirited Fox of fire and Earth, with your cunning, guide our hearth. Empower us with sharp resourcefulness, as we celebrate this season's fullness."

**Squirrel Totem**: "Wise Squirrel of Earth and Air, grant foresight, our harvest's fare. Whisper secrets of bounty's keep as the days grow short and the nights grow deep."

**Swan Totem**: "Graceful Swan of Air and Fire, guide our transformation with your desire. Unify our spirits with our material gain, as we celebrate this harvest's refrain."

4. **Rituals and Practices**:

**Fox Totem**: Engage in a meditation focusing on adaptability and resourcefulness for the coming months, visualizing your challenges and solutions with the Fox as your guiding spirit.

**Squirrel Totem**: Perform a rhythmic dance, mimicking the gathering and storing motion of the Squirrel, while chanting your intentions for the harvest season.

**Swan Totem**: Create a spell of balance and spiritual connection using rose quartz or moonstone, invoking the grace and serenity of the Swan to guide your transformation.

5. **Ceremonial Feast**:

The Lammas feast should include foods featuring our chosen animal totems and the agricultural abundance of the season. Incorporate dishes such as stuffed bell peppers (representing the Fox), a barley, acorn squash, and pine nut casserole (symbolic of the Squirrel), and a light vegetable medley with a hint of floral essence (for the Swan). Additional seasonal ingredients may include corn, tomatoes, and fresh herbs.

6. **Closing Ritual**:

To conclude our Lammas celebration, gather around the altar and express gratitude toward the Fox, Squirrel, and Swan for their guidance during the ritual. Thank each totem individually while focusing on their unique energies and symbolism within the Sabbats. Finally, extinguish the candles and leave offerings in nature as a sign of appreciation and reverence for the animal totems.
