The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) are two of the most advanced particle colliders designed to explore the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. While both colliders possess unique designs, each has its own merits and drawbacks when it comes to discovering and analyzing hypothetical particles, such as supersymmetric particles and dark matter candidates. 

1. **Collision Energies**:

LHC: One of the greatest merits of the LHC is its ability to achieve high collision energiesâ€”up to 14 Tera-electronvolts (TeV). This is crucial for discovering more massive particles, such as those in supersymmetry theories. However, it achieves energy by colliding protons, which are composite particles. This leads to more complex collision events with increased background noise, making it challenging to analyze the data and isolate new particles.

ILC: The ILC uses electron-positron collisions, providing cleaner collision events due to the fundamental nature of these particles. Nevertheless, the linear design limits its collision energy, with an initial plan for 500 Giga-electronvolts (GeV). While this energy is sufficient for specific searches such as Higgs boson properties, it might be insufficient to detect more massive hypothetical particles.

2. **Detection of Elusive Particles**:

LHC: The LHC has successfully detected the Higgs boson, giving it an advantage in searching for particles that might interact with the Higgs field. However, the complex collision events and the fact that certain hypothetical particles, such as dark matter, might leave no direct signature in the detectors make some detections challenging.

ILC: The ILC's cleaner collision events and its potential for precision measurements are definite merits. It is more sensitive to detecting rare processes such as the production of dark matter candidates and lighter supersymmetric particles. Nevertheless, it might lack the necessary energy for detecting more massive particles, limiting its discovery potential.

3. **Sustainable Operation Costs**:

LHC: Operating a large circular collider like the LHC requires significant energy and resources. The fact that the LHC has already been built and is operational provides a distinct advantage. Still, it may require upgrades and extensions to maintain its potential for discovering new particles in the long term.

ILC: The linear design of the ILC offers a more compact and potentially energy-efficient solution. However, the high construction costs and the need for international collaboration to finance the project are substantial challenges yet to be overcome.

Proposed Modifications/Improvements:

LHC: To enhance the LHC's performance, an upgrade known as the High-Luminosity LHC is planned. This aims to increase the collision rate by a factor of 10, improving its discovery potential. Another modification could be adapting or extending the LHC to collide heavier ions, allowing for further insight into the properties of dark matter candidates.

ILC: To address the limited collision energy of the ILC, researchers could consider developing high-gradient accelerator structures that allow for more significant energy boosts within the same space and constructing longer linear colliders. This would increase the potential for discovering more massive hypothetical particles while maintaining the advantage of cleaner collision events.

In conclusion, both the LHC and ILC have merits and drawbacks when it comes to discovering and analyzing hypothetical particles. While the LHC reaches high collision energies, it struggles with complex collision events. In contrast, the ILC provides cleaner events but might lack energy for detecting more massive particles. Combining the advantages of both designs and improving them, such as through high-luminosity upgrades for the LHC and higher energy potential for the ILC, could enhance their performance in achieving the research objective of discovering and studying new particles.
