## Chapter 5: The Red Sects - Bizango and Makaya

### 5.1 Introduction

Bizango and Makaya are two of the most notable branches of the Red Sects, a broad category of esoteric and occult practices stemming from the Afro-Caribbean religious traditions. These sects have their roots in West African spiritual systems, which were preserved and adapted by enslaved communities brought to the Caribbean, most notably Haiti. Bizango and Makaya, often associated with each other but existing as distinct practices, both incorporate elements of Vodou, Catholicism, and indigenous Taino spirituality, ultimately creating a unique and complex system of beliefs and rituals. In this chapter, we will delve into the key beliefs, rituals, and practices of Bizango and Makaya, providing a rich and contextual understanding for students seeking to deepen their knowledge of these esoteric traditions.

### 5.2 Key Beliefs

5.2.1 Bizango

Bizango, at its core, is a secret society that enforces societal order and protects the organization's members from external threats. It blends elements of Vodou with indigenous beliefs, focusing on ancestral spirits and Lwa (Vodou spirits or deities). Bizango's key beliefs center on the concept of "tsakapa," which refers to the transformative power of the spirits to defend against enemies and seek justice. This transformative power can manifest as both material and spiritual changes, encompassing the concept of "metamorphosis" in mind, body, and environment.

Another central belief is the existence of "djab" or "baka," supernatural entities that can be harnessed and controlled by Bizango practitioners. These spirits are generally associated with the spirits of deceased practitioners and may be called upon in rituals and ceremonies to provide guidance or assistance in achieving particular objectives. It should be noted that djab or baka are not inherently evil but rather ambivalent forces that can be employed for both positive and negative purposes.

5.2.2 Makaya

Makaya, although similar in roots to Bizango, focuses on the spiritual empowerment of the individual and the community's unity and well-being. In Makaya, practitioners, known as "makayaiz," acknowledge the existence of the Lwa and other spirits, seeking to forge relationships with these forces and channel their energies into personal and collective improvement. A core belief in Makaya is that the universe is governed by a divine equilibrium, facilitated by communication with the Lwa and ancestral spirits. By establishing and maintaining this equilibrium, Makaya practitioners can access a spiritual force known as "mají," which empowers and fortifies individuals and allows them to face life's challenges.

### 5.3 Rituals and Practices

5.3.1 Bizango

Bizango rituals and ceremonies often take place in hidden spaces, away from the eyes of non-initiates. The rituals serve multiple purposes, including communal bonding, decision-making, and collective protection from adversaries. Bizango rituals can be organized around the core elements of initiation, invocation of djab or baka, and transformation.

Initiation: Members of Bizango undergo an initiation process, serving as a rite of passage and a means of ensuring their commitment and loyalty. This initiation may involve periods of fasting, ritual bathing, and the creation and ingestion of powerful spiritual concoctions.

Invocation: Bizango practitioners call upon ancestral spirits and Lwa in their rituals through songs, dances, and drumming. These invocations help create a connection between the living and the spiritual realm, facilitating communication and assistance from divine entities.

Transformation: Bizango rituals incorporate the transformative power of tsakapa through ceremonies involving symbolic rebirth and renewal. This may include acts such as ritual scarification or the wearing of ceremonial garb, representing a connection to both spiritual and physical metamorphosis.

5.3.2 Makaya

Makaya rituals share similarities with Bizango regarding the involvement of songs, dances, and drumming to connect with the spiritual realm. However, Makaya rituals often focus on the goal of achieving divine equilibrium and accessing the empowering force of mají.

Ceremonies: Regular ceremonies involving the entire community strengthen connections between community members and the spiritual realm. These gatherings often involve feasts, offerings, and libations, with an emphasis on gratitude and respect for the Lwa and ancestral spirits.

Indigenous Elements: Makaya practitioners value the connection to indigenous spirituality and often incorporate Taino-derived elements such as sacred herbs, sacred spaces, and symbolic talismans in their rituals.

Divination: Divination is an important aspect of Makaya practice, utilized to gain guidance from the Lwa and confirm the maintenance of the cosmic balance. Divinatory tools such as cowrie shells or bones may be employed, with skilled diviners interpreting the messages received.

In conclusion, Bizango and Makaya represent two distinct branches of the Red Sects, each retaining a complex set of beliefs, rituals, and practices. While both traditions maintain their roots in Afro-Caribbean spirituality and touch on similar themes, they also possess unique qualities that embody their respective aims and values. By deepening our understanding of Bizango and Makaya, we can appreciate the richness and significance of these esoteric traditions within the broader context of Afro-Caribbean spiritual systems.
