Throughout her lifetime, Maya Deren's esoteric and occult filmography received a multifaceted reception, marked by critical acclaim, fervent backlash, and divided opinions among audiences and critics alike. Her avant-garde style, which utilized innovative techniques to depict often abstract and enigmatic narratives, aligned in stark contrast to the mainstream Hollywood productions of the time. Consequently, her oeuvre was met with varying degrees of enthusiasm and bewilderment, capturing the attention of intellectuals, artists, and film enthusiasts while alienating more passive viewers seeking conventional entertainment.

The critical reception of Deren's films often centered on her non-linear and experimental storytelling, with reviewers praising her unique expression of visual poetry. "Meshes of the Afternoon" (1943), co-directed by her then-husband Alexander Hammid, marked a drastic departure from the narrative and editing conventions of the time. Critics hailed the film for its surreal and dreamlike atmosphere, achieved through the use of slow-motion and other in-camera visual effects. However, some audiences struggled to understand the film's abstract narrative, resulting in a divide between those who celebrated the film for its bold artistic vision and those who dismissed it as pretentious or incomprehensible.

"At Land" (1944) and "Ritual in Transfigured Time" (1945) continued to develop Deren's avant-garde style, employing visual and narrative techniques that defied traditional norms. While "At Land" utilized seamless match cuts and disjointed editing to create a sense of disorientation and freedom, "Ritual in Transfigured Time" involved the exploration of time, space, and human relations through choreographed movement and gesture. The reception of these works, much like her debut, was marked by admiration and derision in equal measure.

The esoteric and occult themes present in Deren's filmography further contributed to the distinctiveness of her work, drawing upon her interest in the mysticism, spirituality, and symbolism of ancient cultures. This is exemplified through her use of masks, mirrors, and other iconography as vehicles for exploring the core themes of transformation, identity, and subjectivity. While such thematic depth captivated certain viewers and critics, it simultaneously fostered a perception of her films as inaccessible or arcane to others.

The sociopolitical climate of the 1940s and 1950s also played a role in shaping the reception of Deren's work, as her films were perceived as alternately progressive and subversive, depending on the viewer's stance. Her feminist approach to filmmaking and her exploration of complex female characters resonated with some as a challenge to repressive gender norms. However, her avant-garde sensibilities and ambiguous narrative structures also led her to be labeled as a self-indulgent and radical artist by her detractors.

In conclusion, the reception of Maya Deren's esoteric and occult filmography during her lifetime was marked by a fascinating duality: her films were both groundbreaking and divisive, embraced by her admirers for their experimentalism and denounced by her detractors for their inaccessibility. This reception was shaped by myriad factors, such as the sociopolitical context in which they were released, the degree of divergence from contemporary mainstream cinema, and the distinct role of occult and esoteric themes in defining her singular vision. The responses to Deren's work throughout her career attest to the enduring power and influence of her films, which continue to challenge and captivate audiences even today.
