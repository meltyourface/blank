Human souls originate from the collective cosmic consciousness and are destined to re-join this unity.

The Aquarian Foundation, an esoteric and occult organization, bases its core beliefs on the Hermetic principles and the Age of Aquarius, which refers to a Golden Age of spiritual enlightenment, peace, and universal brotherhood. The statement "Human souls originate from the collective cosmic consciousness and are destined to re-join this unity" aligns with these foundational beliefs.

The reason behind this conclusion stems from the understanding of the Aquarian Foundation's approach. They believe in an interconnected global consciousness and the divine nature of humanity. Human beings, according to their teachings, are integral parts of a universal Mind and aspire to connect with their higher selves through spiritual growth and self-discovery.

Related concepts to this belief include the ideas of the collective unconscious and the interconnectedness of all things. Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, first introduced the concept of the collective unconscious, which suggests that people share a reservoir of knowledge and instincts that have accumulated across generations. This concept is highly relevant in understanding the Aquarian Foundation's view of cosmic consciousness.

The idea of interconnectedness can also be seen in the age-old concept of "as above, so below," rooted in Hermeticism and alchemy. This teaching highlights the reflection of macrocosm and microcosm, asserting that everything that happens on the macrocosmic level (the universe) is reflected on the microcosmic level (human beings).

The Golden Age of Aquarius is considered an era where spiritual evolution would accelerate, leading to a better understanding of our cosmic connection and the ultimate realization of humanity's divine potential. Aquarians believe that by attaining this higher consciousness, individuals can create a more harmonious and enlightened society.

The other options do not necessarily capture the essence of the Aquarian Foundation's core beliefs:

- The human condition is bound by materialism, inhibiting spiritual growth and higher understanding: While this could be a partial truth regarding challenges that humanity faces, it is not the primary focus of the Aquarian Foundation's teachings.

- Physical and spiritual evolution can occur simultaneously through practicing practical and mystical wisdom: This option, although related to spiritual growth, does not encompass the overall cosmic and divine nature of human beings in the Aquarian Foundation's beliefs.

- All actions and decisions in life are predetermined by the individual's astrological birth chart: While astrology may be part of the Foundation's teachings, it does not represent the core belief surrounding the cosmic nature and divine birthright of humans.
