3. Service to Humanity: A significant emphasis on altruism, compassion, and a commitment to the betterment of society by sharing spiritual knowledge, wisdom, and healing energy.

4. The Importance of Personal Transformation: The notion that individuals must actively pursue their spiritual growth and transformation to attain higher levels of consciousness and awaken to their divinity.

5. The Unity of All: The acceptance and appreciation for all paths of spirituality, religions, and philosophical systems, embracing diversity and promoting tolerance, understanding, and love.
