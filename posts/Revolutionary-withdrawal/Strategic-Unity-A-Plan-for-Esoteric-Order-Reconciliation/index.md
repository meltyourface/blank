In order to devise a strategic resolution for the impending discord among rival sects within the clandestine order of Revolutionary withdrawal, I will take the following steps to employ diplomatic ingenuity, dissect intricate objectives, driving forces of each faction, and preserve the sanctity of the order's esoteric and occult knowledge:
**Step 1**: Gather Intel
Acquire extensive knowledge on each faction's objectives, motivations, strengths, weaknesses, and internal hierarchies through research, infiltration, and cooperation with key informants within the sects. Ensure communication channels are secure to minimize the risk of infiltration and leaks.
**Step 2**: Identity Common Ground
Identify shared concerns, goals, and aspirations among the sects that can provide a foundation for negotiations and consensus-building. Examine the core tenets of Revolutionary withdrawal, seeking alignment between the factions' intentions and the original teachings.
**Step 3**: Decipher Arcane Texts and Prophecies
Assess the guiding principles, prophecies, and hidden messages within the order's key texts and utilize them to help frame a new perspective and understanding that suits each faction's needs. Encourage a fresh interpretation, emphasizing complementarity and collaboration rather than discord.
**Step 4**: Develop a Unifying Ritual
Devise an intricate ritual to symbolize the reinvigoration of unity and harmony—drawing upon the order's mystical and occult practices. Utilize the aforementioned deciphered arcane texts and prophecies to imbue the ritual with a sense of historic significance and spiritual potency.
**Step 5**: Engage in Diplomatic Negotiations
Using gathered intel and common ground, begin the delicate process of diplomatic negotiations. Have representatives of each faction discuss their differences and seek mutually beneficial resolutions. Encourage empathy and a cooperative, non-adversarial approach to problem-solving.
**Step 6**: Invoke Spiritual Guidance
Channel the spiritual wisdom of the order's founding figures and mystics, invoking their guidance to break deadlocks and offer solace during challenging moments in the negotiations. Create an atmosphere of reverence and alignment with the core tenets of Revolutionary withdrawal.
**Step 7**: Create a Pact of Reconciliation
Draft a formal pact that outlines the agreed-upon resolutions to the conflict, binding each faction to their commitment to work cooperatively and maintain unified action in the pursuit of the order's goals and mystical experiences. Use symbols, language, and rituals specific to the order to underscore the importance of the pact.
**Step 8**: Monitor and Foster Unity
Establish a system for ongoing communication, conflict resolution, and growth among the factions. Encourage regular dialogue, shared rituals, and collaborative efforts to further the order's work in esoteric, occult, and Revolutionary withdrawal teachings, fostering an ongoing culture of unity, trust, and mutual support.

By following these steps, we can successfully navigate the complexities of the discord among rival sects and restore unity, balance, and harmony within the clandestine order dedicated to Revolutionary withdrawal—a unity that ensures the continued pursuit of mystical enlightenment and the safeguarding of the order's sacred knowledge.
