To answer this knowledge challenge and fully address the integration of Jungian archetypes, Tarot symbolism, and mindfulness principles, let us first break down the various components of the question and explore the underpinning ideas before weaving them into a wholistic understanding of the self that could transform psychotherapy from a mere therapeutic method into an all-encompassing way of being.

1. Jungian Archetypes: Carl Jung proposed the concept of archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images residing in the collective unconscious. These archetypes are essentially unconscious ideas or thought patterns shared by all humans across all cultures and time. Some common examples of Jungian archetypes include the Shadow (our darker, repressed self), the Anima/Animus (the feminine/masculine aspects of the self), and the Self (the unification of the conscious and unconscious aspects of our personality). 

2. Tarot Symbolism: The Tarot is a system of divination and self-development using a deck of cards, each adorned with symbols and images reflecting different aspects of the human experience. The 78-card Tarot deck is divided into the Major Arcana (22 cards representing significant life events and spiritual lessons) and the Minor Arcana (56 cards meant to provide insight into the daily situations and challenges). Some famous cards in the Tarot include The Fool (new beginnings, stepping into the unknown), The Lovers (union, integration of dualities), and The Tower (sudden change, disruption). 

3. Principles of Mindfulness: Mindfulness is a practice centered on cultivating a non-judgmental, present-focused awareness of the thoughts, emotions, and sensations occurring within our body and mind. By developing this awareness, one can learn to observe the workings of the mind without being overwhelmed, thus enhancing their overall well-being and self-understanding. Key principles within mindfulness include non-judgment, equanimity, and compassion for oneself and others.

Now that we have introduced these three elements, we can proceed to demonstrate how one may integrate them to develop a wholistic understanding of the self and transform psychotherapy into an all-encompassing way of being.
**Step 1**: Acknowledging the Archetypes within
The first step in this integrative process requires acquainting oneself with the core Jungian archetypes and examining how they manifest within their personality and unconscious. Individuals could engage in a deep exploration of their personas, shadows, and anima/animus, which aids in demystifying previously unrecognized aspects of the self. This self-reflection fosters awareness and encourages integration of disparate elements of one’s identity into a more cohesive whole.
**Step 2**: Utilizing Tarot as a Self-Reflective Tool
Tarot symbolism closely aligns with the Jungian archetypes and can serve as a powerful experiential tool for exploring the self. By engaging with Tarot in a mindful and intentional manner, individuals can harness the archetypal imagery within the cards to unveil and understand their own inner dynamics, psychological patterns, and relationships. This integration and understanding empowers individuals to cultivate self-awareness and embrace personal growth.
**Step 3**: Cultivating Mindfulness
The practice of mindfulness helps one observe their thoughts, emotions, and sensations without judgment or attachment, thus promoting mental clarity, resilience, and self-compassion. Mindfulness allows for an objective and compassionate approach toward examining aspects of oneself revealed through the exploration of Jungian archetypes and Tarot symbolism, leading to the transformative integration of conflicting aspects of the self.

In summary, transforming psychotherapy into an all-encompassing way of being involves:

1. Exploring and embracing Jungian archetypes as universal patterns present within the self.
2. Utilizing Tarot symbolism as a powerful, experiential tool to uncover the inner workings of the psyche and engage with the collective unconscious.
3. Employing mindfulness principles to cultivate equanimity, non-judgment, and compassionate self-awareness in every aspect of one's life, promoting personal growth and self-understanding.

Through the integration of these elements, one can develop a wholistic understanding of the self that extends beyond traditional psychotherapy – ultimately transforming it into a more comprehensive, transformative, and genuinely authentic way of being.
