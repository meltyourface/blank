## Ancestral Web of Empathy (AWE) - A Family Therapy Intervention

Theoretical Framework:

The Ancestral Web of Empathy (AWE) intervention is a holistic, innovative family therapy approach grounded in the principles of Psychotherapy as a way of being. It incorporates a range of therapeutic modalities, such as Systemic Family Therapy, Narrative Therapy, Emotion Focused Therapy, and Transgenerational Trauma Healing. It is designed to address and resolve deeply-rooted generational patterns of conflict within a client's family system.

Proposed Session Structure:

1. Intake and assessment: The therapist meets with each family member individually to gather information about their perspective on the family's history, relationships, and conflict patterns. This thorough assessment will inform the therapist's understanding of the family's unique dynamics and needs.

2. Family mapping: In a joint session, the therapist guides the family in creating a visual representation of the family system and its interconnected relationships. This family map serves as a tool to explore historical, emotional, and relational patterns.

3. Ancestral Interviews: The therapist conducts in-depth, semi-structured interviews with each family member, using open-ended questions to elicit insights about the roots of family conflicts. These interviews tap into the intersubjective and transgenerational nature of the family's narrative.

4. Emotional Sculpting: In a transformative group exercise, family members are asked to physically position themselves in a manner that represents the emotional dynamics in the family system. The therapist then guides them through a process of re-sculpting their physical positions to create a more empathic and harmonious family structure.

5. Generational Healing Circles: The family participates in a series of circle-based discussions, designed to facilitate empathic listening, validation, and understanding among family members. The circles bring together different generations and provide space for truth-telling and healing from collective traumas.

6. Therapeutic Letters: Each family member writes a letter to one or more ancestors, addressing unresolved conflicts and expressing gratitude for positive contributions. The letters are then read aloud in a joint session, symbolically releasing family burdens and healing generational rifts.

7. Empathy Training and Skill-Building: The therapist provides psychoeducation on empathy and its role in conflict resolution. Family members engage in role-plays and interactive activities to practice empathic listening and communication skills.

8. Reauthoring Family Narratives: With the therapist's guidance, family members work together to create a new shared narrative that incorporates healing and empathy, and fosters resilience and growth for future generations.

9. Closure and Follow-Up: The therapist reviews progress made during the intervention and discusses plans for maintaining the positive changes. Follow-up sessions may be scheduled to support the family's ongoing growth and healing.

By integrating diverse therapeutic modalities and techniques tailored to the unique dynamics and needs of the family members involved, the Ancestral Web of Empathy (AWE) intervention aims to facilitate transformative change and healing in the given family context. Through active participation in AWE, family members can break free from generational patterns of conflict and build stronger, more empathic relationships for a healthier future.
