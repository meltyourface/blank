  1. A comprehensive evaluation of the client's body image perception, self-esteem level, and psychological factors influencing their experiences.

To design and implement a multi-faceted psychotherapeutic intervention for fostering self-esteem enhancement in a client experiencing body dysmorphic disorder, follow these steps:
**Step 1**: Comprehensive Evaluation

Begin with a thorough evaluation of the client's body image perception, self-esteem level, and psychological factors influencing their experiences. Utilize standardized questionnaires such as the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) to gather relevant information. Explore the client's personal history and family dynamics to uncover potential contributory factors to their disorder.
**Step 2**: Integrative Approach

Develop an integrative approach combining the therapeutic elements from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and humanistic therapy. Use CBT interventions to identify and challenge the client's irrational beliefs and thought patterns. In psychodynamic therapy, help them to resolve emotional conflicts and uncover unconscious motivations. With humanistic therapy, guide the client towards authentic self-expression and self-actualization. 
**Step 3**: Practical Exercises

Tailor a series of practical exercises, such as mirror exposures, body scans, and cognitive restructuring techniques to help the client confront their body-related fears. Encourage them to challenge negative thoughts and cultivate a more compassionate view of their physical appearance through these exercises.
**Step 4**: Creative Arts Therapies

Integrate creative arts therapies, such as expressive writing, painting, or movement into the psychotherapeutic intervention. These artistic modes encourage self-exploration and nurture the client's connection with their body in a non-threatening manner.
**Step 5**: Support System

Design a support system that includes validating the client's emotions, fostering a sense of autonomy, and creating a therapeutic alliance. Establish regular checkpoints to assess progress and adapt the intervention as needed. Encourage the client to seek additional support from friends, family, and support groups, facilitating a sense of connection and belonging.
**Step 6**: Relapse Prevention Plan

Develop a relapse prevention plan, highlighting the potential triggers and teaching the client how to employ self-compassion and self-affirmation strategies to counter these. Implement realistic goal-setting methods that emphasize small, attainable milestones, which can maintain long-term self-esteem and positive body image post-therapy.

By following these six steps, a comprehensive, adaptive, and effective psychotherapeutic intervention can be implemented, which will foster self-esteem enhancement and facilitate the client's journey towards a healthier relationship with their body and self-image.
