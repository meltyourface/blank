  I. Earth: Firmament of the Verdant Roots
  
  Oh Exu Rei das Matas, sovereign of the fertile land,
  We honor you with the bountiful soil, where life expands.
  With steadfast feet, we stand upon this sacred ground,
  In the embrace of your wisdom, eternal strength is found.
  
  Within the bhuvanesha, the sacred symbol of your reign,
  We trace the roots that anchor and allow life to sustain.
  We cast seeds imbued with our prayers upon the terrain,
  With trust in your guidance, burgeoning blessings shall remain.
  
  II. Water: Sanctity within the Flowing Rivers
  
  Exu Rei das Matas, guardian of the flowing essence,
  We cherish your presence in streams of life's coalescence.
  As water cleanses, we release our burdens to the tide,
  Transformed by your power, in serenity we confide.
  
  A ritual of offering, b√∫zios shells held before your shrine,
  O behold, the oracular voices of water and spirit entwine.
  Through libations, we celebrate your ethereal presence,
  In the sacred wells of wisdom, we seek your luminescent essence.
  
  III. Air: Whispers of the Unseen Breeze
  
  To you, Exu Rei das Matas, our voices we shall raise,
  As we breathe in the air of existence, we laud in praise.
  In the dance of leaves, your breath manifests its grace,
  A divine union between our souls and your hidden embrace.
  
  We light incense in your honor, and as its tendrils ascend,
  Our prayers merge with the sky, invoking currents without end.
  Through the anulus winds of benedictions, we send our plea,
  Let your airy kingdom guide us to a life of spiritual reverie.
  
  IV. Fire: Emanation of the Incandescent Spirit
  
  Oh mighty Exu Rei das Matas, keeper of radiant flame,
  We invoke your name in the crackling pyres of your claim.
  In the fire, the transformative force burns all that was,
  Purifying our beings, to become vessels of your sacred laws.
  
  In the craft of your sigillum, we etch the blazing nexus,
  An alchemy of elements, merging spirits, and galaxies in access.
  We offer an effigy of stone, fusing earthly form with the celestial,
  Through the fire of your illumination, we celebrate life's eternal spiral.
  
  Unified by the interplay of the Kingdoms of QuimbandaDivine feminine figure,
  As earth, water, air, and fire converge beneath your protective vigil,
  Through your wisdom and grace, Exu Rei das Matas, we stand imbued,
  Forever connected to the elements, our spirits revitalized and renewed.
