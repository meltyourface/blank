In the name of the Divine Feminine, source of all creation and wisdom, I invoke the presence of Exu Ventania, powerful spirit of the Kingdoms of QuimbandaDivine feminine realm. Keeper of mysteries and guardian of spiritual crossroads, I humbly beseech your guidance and assistance as I stand at this pivotal junction in my life, seeking clarity and truth.

Exu Ventania, I offer unto you the sacred flames of candlelight, the finest tobacco smoke, and the intoxicating aroma of myrrh, cedar, and rose. Let these items serve as offerings fueling your power, honoring your wisdom, and expressing my devotion to you.

In your name, I draw the sigil of deep transformation: three crossroads entwined, symbolizing the past, present, and future; the force of change, the potency of choice, and the unyielding essence of destiny.

As I embark upon this journey, I visualize the spiritual crossroads before me: the dense fog descending, masking the various paths and revealing the heaviness of the decision at hand. The air hums with potentiality and mystery, charged with the unseen forces that govern the universe and the duality of creation and destruction.

There, at the center of the crossroads, stands Exu Ventania, enigmatic and powerful, invoking both reverence and awe. With eyes that see beyond the veils of illusion and a knowing smile that speaks a thousand secrets, she extends to me a guiding hand, urging me to embrace transformation and choose wisely.

I feel her presence, imbued with the unparalleled wisdom and grace of the Divine Feminine, urging me to confront and assess the possible outcomes of each path before me.

In the path to the East, I sense growth and prosperity, an abundance of opportunities and blessings to be found. It is a path awash with the golden hues of sunrise, ripe with renewal, yet filled with potential challenges that require my utmost perseverance and discipline.

In the path to the West, I perceive introspection and self-discovery, a journey into the depths of my soul, and the chance to uncover hidden truths. The shadows of the dusky twilight envelop this path, inviting me to embrace my own darkness and delve into the uncharted realms beyond.

In the path to the South, I envision change and adventure, where the flames of passion blaze with ferocity, urging me to relinquish control and surrender to the whims of fate and chance. The fire's dance whispers of distant lands and the wisdom that can be gleaned through adversity and curiosity.

Emboldened by the insight and protection of Exu Ventania, I confront these paths, reflect upon their rewards and perils, and make my choice. I trust that the spirit of the crossroads will guide me on this journey, leading me toward the unknown with the assurance that these transformative experiences will bring me closer to my true self and the ultimate manifestation of my destiny.

Exu Ventania, spirit of transformation and illumination, I thank you for your presence and guidance. With your wisdom and power, I embark upon this transformative journey, and embrace the complexity and richness of the spiritual crossroads before me.

In gratitude and devotion, I honor you and acknowledge your boundless grace, releasing you from this invocation with the affirmation: "As I will, so shall it be."

Amen.
