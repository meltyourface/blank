  Answer: To fully respond to the knowledge challenge, we must first understand the historical and theological foundations of Antinomianism, its relationship to Gnosticism, and the individualistic approach to spiritual growth. We will then analyze the paradoxical balance between the rejection of moral law and the cultivation of one's inner ethical compass, which ultimately leads to personal transcendence and freedom from religious dogma.
  
  Antinomianism is a theological term derived from the Greek words "anti," meaning against, and "nomos," meaning law. It refers to the belief that adherents are not bound by moral law, particularly as outlined in religious teachings. Historically, Antinomianism dates back to the early Christian era and has appeared in various forms throughout history, often as a response to institutionalized legalism and moralism. Antinomian ideas have been associated with religious movements, sects, and figures such as the Gnostics, the radical Reformers and the Anabaptists, as well as more contemporary spiritual movements.
  
  Gnosticism is a broad category encompassing various religious beliefs and spiritual practices rooted in a dualistic view of the cosmos. Gnostics believe that knowledge (gnosis) is the key to salvation, and this knowledge is acquired through direct revelation or personal experience rather than through adherence to an external set of rules or teachings. Many Gnostic beliefs and practices emphasize the search for inner truth and self-discovery, often placing more importance on the individual's inner experience over external authorities such as religious institutions.
  
  The relationship between Antinomianism and Gnosticism lies primarily in their shared emphasis on individual spiritual growth and direct connection to the divine, often bypassing or even challenging traditional religious orthodoxy and dogmas. Both traditions express a distrust of institutionalized law and argue that strict adherence to rules and teachings can lead to spiritual stagnation or even bondage.
  
  In light of these historical and theological contexts, we can now analyze the paradoxical balance between the rejection of moral law and the cultivation of one's inner ethical compass. Although Antinomianism is often criticized for promoting lawlessness and immorality, a more nuanced understanding suggests that it instead emphasizes the cultivation of an inner sense of moral guidance. 
  
  By rejecting external moral law as the ultimate source of ethical guidance, Antinomianism encourages the individual to develop an internal, direct connection to the divine. This connection, shaped by personal experience and self-reflection, allows the individual to cultivate their own inner ethical compass better aligned with their unique spiritual path.
  
  In this context, the paradoxical balance between the rejection of moral law and the cultivation of one's inner ethical compass can be seen as a necessary and purposeful tension. It allows the individual to explore the boundaries of their own moral and ethical framework, challenging preconceived notions and embracing a deeper, more authentic understanding of themselves and their relationship to the divine. This, in turn, fosters personal transcendence, embracing the transformative power of the divine within, and ultimately leads to freedom from restrictive religious dogmas and institutionalized barriers.
  
  In conclusion, the paradoxical balance between rejecting moral law and cultivating one's inner ethical compass in Antinomianism, as informed by its historical and theological context and relationship to Gnosticism, serves as a provocative and empowering approach to spiritual growth. It pushes individuals to engage in critical self-reflection and pursue a more authentic, direct connection with the divine. This path allows for personal transcendence and freedom from the confines of religious dogma, thus enriching the spiritual journey of those who embrace such perspectives.
