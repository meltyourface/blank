The assertion that individual morality can be disregarded or even subverted in order to transcend conventional limitations, leading to spiritual growth and understanding through opposition to societal mores.

Antinomianism, from the Greek "anti-" (against) and "nomos" (law), is a broad term that generally refers to a belief that moral laws and conventional standards do not apply, or can even be disregarded, in the pursuit of spiritual growth, understanding, and personal transcendence. This idea has been particularly controversial throughout history as it often challenges the established moral and behavioral norms of religious and social institutions.

The second option touches upon some aspects of Antinomianism, specifically the emphasis on personal insight and experiences. However, it doesn't delve into the rejection or subversion of moral norms, which is the core belief and primary controversy of Antinomianism.

The first and fourth options, while related to spiritual practices and the pursuit of knowledge, do not directly address the antinomian perspective. The first option speaks to strict adherence to moral codes, which is the opposite of Antinomianism, while the fourth option refers to the pursuit of esoteric teachings but does not mention the core belief of Antinomianism.

In the context of occult practices, Antinomianism has often been viewed as a radical approach that enables individuals to break free from the constraints imposed by religious and societal institutions. It is considered as enabling access to hidden or forbidden knowledge, and as a means to challenge and transcend one's own limitations.

Historically, Antinomianism has been associated with various religious and spiritual movements, such as Gnosticism, which sought to transcend conventional dogma in pursuit of personal spiritual enlightenment. Alchemy and various left-hand path traditions have also incorporated Antinomian themes as they often involve the exploration of taboo subjects and experimentation that defies social norms.

In summary, the core belief of Antinomianism lies in the assertion that individual morality can be disregarded or even subverted in order to transcend conventional limitations, leading to spiritual growth and understanding through opposition to societal mores. This belief has been controversial as it often challenges the established moral and behavioral norms of religious and social institutions and has been associated with various radical spiritual movements throughout history.
