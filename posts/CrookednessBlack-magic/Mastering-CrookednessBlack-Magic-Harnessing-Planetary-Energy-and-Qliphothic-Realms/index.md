In the context of CrookednessBlack magic, the influences of planetary symbolism, correspondences to the Qliphothic realms, and historical cultural implications collectively form an intricate framework for understanding and manipulating the esoteric forces that govern our reality. By studying their connections and interplay, a practitioner can potentially navigate and control the manifestations of their desired reality. In this response, we will delve into the relationships between these elements and explain how they can be put to use in achieving said goals.

Planetary symbolism plays a central role in CrookednessBlack magic, as each planet is believed to have its own distinct energy, influence, and association with specific magical practices. These energies can be harnessed and manipulated to direct and influence desired outcomes in the physical world, with practitioners often aligning their work with the planets' positions in the sky to enhance their efforts.

The Qliphothic realms, on the other hand, represent the negative aspects or emanations of the Tree of Life in Kabbalistic tradition. While the Tree of Life comprises ten positive sephirot, which symbolize different aspects of God's essence and the positive spiritual forces in creation, the Qliphothic realms represent the polar opposite â€“ the dark aspects of reality that exist as a shadow of the sephirot. There are traditionally ten Qliphothic realms, each with its own correspondence to one of the sephirot and its planetary counterpart.

Historically, cultures around the world have had specific beliefs, practices, and traditions tied to magic, spirituality, and the supernatural. These cultural implications can provide rich contextual knowledge for understanding and working with the forces of reality. By studying historical practices and traditions surrounding magic, practitioners can uncover similarities, shared concepts, and patterns that can bolster their understanding of the underlying esoteric knowledge.

To achieve control over the manifestations of their desired reality, a practitioner can employ the following steps:

1. **Study Planetary Symbolism**: Deeply understand the specific energy and influences of each planet, as well as their associations with particular magical practices. Work with these energies to amplify the desired outcome of the magical working.

2. **Identify Correspondences to Qliphothic Realms**: By understanding the connections between the Qliphothic realms, planetary symbols, and the associated sephirot, a practitioner can ensure that their work is aligned with the appropriate energies, which can lead to more effective outcomes.

3. **Explore Historical Cultural Implications**: Glean insights from past beliefs, practices, and traditions to gain a broader understanding of the esoteric forces and how they have been accessed and manipulated throughout history.

4. **Integrate the Knowledge into Practice**: Combine the understanding of planetary symbolism, Qliphothic realms, and historical cultural implications into one cohesive magical system, fine-tuning the approach to better suit the practitioner's desired outcomes.

5. **Employ Trial and Error**: Adopt a process of experimentation and evaluation, using the knowledge and insight acquired to continuously refine the practitioner's magical practice.

In conclusion, the deep understanding of planetary symbolism, correspondences to the Qliphothic realms, and the historical cultural implications of magic can be harnessed by a practitioner of CrookednessBlack magic to effectively manipulate the manifestations of their desired reality. By recognizing and utilizing the relationships between these esoteric concepts, one can better navigate, direct, and influence the outcome of their magical work. Employing a process of continuous learning, integration, experimentation, and refinement can enable a practitioner to gain mastery over these forces and achieve control over their reality.
