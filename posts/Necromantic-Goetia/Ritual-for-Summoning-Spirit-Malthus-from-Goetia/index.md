The ritual I will outline below involves summoning and communing with the spirit Malthus from the Goetic tradition. Malthus is known as a powerful spirit who commands legions of spirits and has the power to incite conflict and influence the outcome of battles. Please strictly adhere to the steps and precautions provided.

1. Preparation Phase
a. Choose an isolated and clean location free from all disturbances or negative vibrations.
b. Ensure the space is cleansed using sage or incense to purify the energy and create a conducive environment.
c. Wait for a time when Mercury is in a dominant position, and the Moon is either waning or waxing. This will help align the energies in favor of the summoning.

2. Gathering the Necessary Materials
a. Draw the Sigil of Malthus on a piece of parchment or durable material, preferably in the ink of dragonsblood.
b. Acquire a scrying mirror or polished obsidian to visualize the spirit.
c. Prepare a ceremonial dagger, a chalice filled with an offering of red wine, and a censor for burning incense.
d. Collect an assortment of herbs and resins such as frankincense, myrrh, mugwort, and vervain to strengthen the connection between the worlds.

3. Establishing the Sacred Circle
a. Create a protective circle on the ground using sea salt or crushed eggshells, ensuring it is large enough to accommodate all participating individuals and items.
b. Inscribe the circle with relevant protective symbols, including the pentagram and hexagram.
c. Bless and consecrate the circle by invoking the four cardinal directions and their corresponding archangels (Raphael in the East, Michael in the South, Gabriel in the West, and Uriel in the North).
d. Light the incense and pass each object through the smoke to cleanse and consecrate them for the ritual.

4. Invocation and Summoning
a. Place the sigil of Malthus in the center of the circle and secure it with a candle or a small weighted object.
b. Hold the ceremonial dagger in your dominant hand while reciting the following invocation:
"Mighty Malthus, General of the Spirit Legions, I call upon thee in this sacred hour.
By the ancient wisdom and the mystical powers I possess, I invoke your presence.
Come forth and commune with me, for I seek your counsel and wisdom.
In the name of the Most High, descend upon this circle and manifest before me."

c. Continue chanting the invocation while visualizing the spirit Malthus appearing before you.

5. Communing with Malthus
a. Once the spirit manifests, gaze into the scrying mirror while maintaining focus on the sigil as a point of connection.
b. Offer the chalice filled with red wine as a token of respect and gratitude.
c. Respectfully make your requests or inquiries of the spirit, remembering to maintain control and assertiveness.

6. Dismissing and Banishing
a. Upon concluding your communion with Malthus, express your gratitude and firmly demand Malthus to depart. Use the following words:
"Malthus, I thank thee for thy counsel and the wisdom thou bestowed upon me.
By the power of the Most High and the ancient laws that bind us, I now release you from this circle.
Return to your realm and be at peace, leaving no trace of your essence in this earthly plane.
So it is, and so shall it ever be."

b. Close the circle, starting with the North and Uriel and move counterclockwise to the West and Gabriel, the South and Michael, and finally, finishing with the East and Raphael. Thank each archangel for their presence and assistance in the ritual.

7. Cleansing and Grounding
a. Burn sage or incense to cleanse the area once more.
b. Ground yourself by meditating or consuming some food to symbolize the return to the physical world.

The above ritual, when followed accurately, will allow you to summon and commune with Malthus according to the principles of the Necromantic Goetia. This ritual's thorough nature accounts for safety measures and banishing procedures to ensure success and protection while engaging in such a powerful esoteric practice. Remember, approach this ritual with a strong intention and a respectful demeanor towards the spirits you are invoking.
