For this exercise, I will reinterpret the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) within the lens of urban shamanism. The LBRP is a prominent ritual from the Equinox texts, which serves as a foundational practice in Western occultism.

1. **Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)**: The LBRP is used to banish unwanted energies and establish a sacred space for magical workings. This ritual involves invoking elemental, planetary, and divine energies, as well as drawing pentagrams in the four cardinal directions to create a protective barrier.

2. Symbolic meanings, associations, and principles: The LBRP is a symbol of the magician's mastery over the forces of nature and the elements. The four pentagrams represent the elements of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, while the invocation of the divine names and planetary forces links the practitioner's consciousness to the macrocosm. The LBRP helps to maintain spiritual balance and encourages a state of focused awareness.

3. **Urban shamanism**: Urban shamanism is a contemporary magical system that adapts traditional shamanic practices for an urban environment and modern lifestyle. Urban shamans work with animal spirits, elemental energies, and ancestral wisdom to create change in their lives and communities.

4. **Modifications to the LBRP**: In reinterpreting the LBRP through the lens of urban shamanism, the framework, techniques, and symbols can be modified as follows:
 a. Replace the traditional pentagrams with elemental sigils derived from contemporary urban shamanic symbols. b. Invoke the power of animal spirits and urban deities in place of the traditional divine names. c. Incorporate urban sounds, such as car horns, sirens, or music, into the ritual's vibratory invocations. d. Utilize the modern cityscape as a backdrop for the cardinal direction points, associating each direction with a specific urban manifestation (e.g., skyscrapers, parks, highways).
  
5. **Integration of modern technology**: The reinterpreted LBRP can harness the power of modern communication tools to amplify the impact of the ritual. For instance, practitioners can record and share their performances, creating a virtual network of urban shamans simultaneously participating in the ritual.

6. **Impact of reinterpretation**: By reinterpreting the LBRP in the context of urban shamanism, the original purpose of banishing unwanted energies and establishing a sacred space remains intact. However, the ritual is now adapted to resonate with contemporary practitioners, forging new connections with the modern environment.

Potential new applications for the urban shamanic LBRP may include:
 a. Purifying and protecting an urban environment from negative influences, such as crime or pollution. b. Connecting with and channeling the wisdom of urban spirits to address social and ecological challenges faced by communities. c. Strengthening personal connections to the city by aligning the practitioner's consciousness with the urban vibrancy and zeitgeist.

In conclusion, the reinterpretation of the LBRP within the framework of urban shamanism entails a process of creative syncretism. By incorporating contemporary symbols, techniques, and technology, the reinterpreted ritual maintains the core purpose of the LBRP, while offering new possibilities for modern practitioners seeking to engage with the hidden forces of the cityscape.
