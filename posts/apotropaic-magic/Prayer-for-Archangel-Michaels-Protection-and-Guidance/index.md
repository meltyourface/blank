description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, apotropaic magic, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Draft an intricate apotropaic incantation to summon the Archangel Michael, the guardian of humanity, focusing on warding off malevolent forces and bolstering spiritual defenses. Incorporate precise references to ancient holy texts and sacred symbols, such as the crescent of St. John and the sign of the cross, for enhanced potency. In addition, craft the incantation in a rhythmic and evocative manner, incorporating rhyming verses and alliteration to evoke a heightened sense of spiritual connection and secure divine protection.

In the sacred name of He who reigns above,
Through the empyreal choir, with love I call,
To thee, Archangel Michael, guardian true,
To shield us from dark forces and defend the weak.

By the crescent of St. John, that lunar light,
And by the cross which bore our Savior's weight,
Reveal thyself, O Michael, and heed this plea,
Unfurl thy wings, and let thy power embrace me.

In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti,
In this sacred space, o'er which holy words weave,
I stand against the shadows that slither far and wide,
To guard the sanctity of all who breathe and smile.

As Solomon's seal entwines within the ancient scrolls,
And hexagrams align within those age-old tomes,
Unleash the might that vanquished Lucifer,
Sword aflame, tempered by the love of Heaven's King.

De mondo profano, ascendam tuam sanctam virtutem,
Blessed protector, leader of celestial hosts,
As Moses' staff birthed forth the cleansing waters,
Bring forth thy light and wash away the night.

Through resplendent fire, and righteous air of clarity,
Encompass me in thy vigilance, Michael the Archangel,
To ward off the infernal, within earth and ether,
As I stand encircled by the hallowed blood of the Lamb.

Upon this ground, I inscribe angelic sigils,
And in my voice, the ancient psalms of saints,
Bear arms, O Michael, against the wicked prowling shadows,
From now unto eternity, In Amicitia Dei, Amen.
