To understand the effectiveness of the given protection spell, we must first explore the chosen apotropaic symbols and rituals from various ancient civilizations which the initiate has selected, evaluating their cultural relevance and the strength they hold when combined. Then, we will analyze the connections between these symbols and rituals, examining their combined influence, and the possibility of amplifying the power of apotropaic magic. In doing so, we'll be able to conclude whether this transcultural protection spell would effectively fend off malevolent supernatural forces.

First, let's discuss the chosen apotropaic symbols and rituals from various ancient civilizations:

1. The ancient Egyptians utilized the Eye of Horus, often known as the 'Wedjat,' as a powerful protective symbol. The god Horus was revered as the embodiment of protection and healing. Sacred rituals involving the use of the Eye of Horus were conducted to keep evil forces at bay.

2. In ancient Greek culture, the Gorgoneion was a symbol of apotropaic significance. Depicting the head of the snake-haired Gorgon, Medusa, it was believed to ward off evil spirits and possess a powerful protective influence. The Greeks would often paint or carve the Gorgoneion on their shields, buildings, and everyday objects.

3. The ancient Romans employed the cornicello, a horned amulet, as an apotropaic tool. This horn-like charm was believed to possess the ability to protect against the evil eye and bring good fortune to its wearer.

4. The Hamsa, a hand-shaped symbol, is a potent apotropaic symbol in the Middle Eastern and North African cultures. The Hamsa is said to represent the Hand of God. It is believed to deflect the evil eye and offer protection from malevolent forces. 

As we can see, each of these symbols and rituals has its cultural significance, representing the protective powers ascribed to certain deities or forces in their respective cultures. This makes them crucial elements in crafting a transcultural protection spell.

Now let's analyze the connections between these symbols and rituals and how their collective influence might amplify the power of apotropaic magic. By combining these ancient symbols and rituals, they work synergistically to create an even more potent force of protection. The mutual power derived from the Eye of Horus, Gorgoneion, Cornicello, and Hamsa is enriched through the shared cultural significance of these symbols.

Furthermore, these symbols and rituals have survived for thousands of years, passing through various civilizations and historical periods, proving the strength of their protective powers. By bringing these symbols together, their long-entrenched protective powers might be amplified to create one powerful and continuous shield against malevolent supernatural forces.

In conclusion, the initiate's decision to select apotropaic symbols and rituals from diverse ancient civilizations to create a transcultural protection spell is effective. The combined strength of the Eye of Horus, Gorgoneion, Cornicello, and Hamsa enables an amplified defense against malevolent supernatural forces. The shared cultural significance of these symbols aids in reinforcing the apotropaic power of this protection spell. By using these symbols and rituals in a transcultural context, their power is strengthened, ensuring the protection spell effectively wards off harmful supernatural forces.
