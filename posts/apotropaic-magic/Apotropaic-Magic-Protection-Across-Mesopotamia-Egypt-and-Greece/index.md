Answering this knowledge challenge requires a comprehensive analysis of apotropaic magic within Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Greek civilizations. To do this, we will assess the elements and efficacy of apotropaic magic, explore the fundamental differences and similarities, and consider the cultural, religious, and societal influences in each civilization. Finally, we will examine the broader understanding and essence of apotropaic magic as a whole, taking into account various factors.

1. Key Aspects of Apotropaic Magic in Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Greek Civilizations
First, let's define apotropaic magic. Apotropaic magic is a form of protective magic designed to ward off evil or harmful influences, often through the use of rituals, talismans, and symbols.

In Mesopotamia, apotropaic magic was essential in daily life and played a significant role in religion, protection, and medicine. The ancient Sumerians and Babylonians believed that demons, evil spirits, and angered gods could cause harm, and apotropaic rituals were used to dispel these potential threats. These rituals commonly involved creating clay figurines, incantations, and the use of amulets.

Egyptian apotropaic magic focused on the protection of people, especially the Pharaoh, tombs, and sacred places. The Egyptians used various symbols, like the Eye of Horus, for protection, and they often conducted rituals to protect different deities and temples. Another essential apotropaic practice was the writing of spells and protective texts on objects or walls, such as the famous Book of the Dead.

In ancient Greece, apotropaic magic relied on the belief in the power of gods, divine protection, and the malign influence of the evil eye. Greeks often used apotropaic symbols and rituals, such as the use of amulets, votive offerings for the gods, and the Gorgoneion (a representation of the Gorgon Medusa) to protect themselves from harm. Gorgoneions were thought to repel evil by turning into stone any malevolent presence that looked upon it.

2. **Fundamental Differences and Similarities**
The primary differences among Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Greek apotropaic practices lie in the symbols, rituals, and specific beliefs associated with each culture. For instance, Mesopotamians often created specific clay figurines to combat malicious spirits, while Egyptians relied more on their written spells and protective texts. Greeks, on the other hand, had a strong focus on protection from the evil eye, using various protective symbols like the Gorgoneion.

Despite these differences, some similarities exist among the three civilizations. They all believed in the existence of malicious supernatural entities and the need for protection. Additionally, talismans, amulets, and protective symbols were common tools employed in all three cultures.

3. Cultural, Religious, and Societal Influences
Each civilization's approach to apotropaic magic was shaped by its unique religious beliefs, societal norms, and cultural practices. In Mesopotamia, the belief system revolved around the gods, who needed to be appeased to maintain harmony. This reliance on divine protection is mirrored in their apotropaic practices.

Egyptians placed a strong emphasis on the afterlife, which is apparent in their elaborate burial rituals and protective spells. The role of Pharaohs as semi-divine beings, as well as the importance of preserving their tombs, played a significant role in Egyptian apotropaic practices.

Greek theology centered around powerful gods who could protect or harm people based on their actions. The belief in the evil eye and the use of Gorgoneions reflects their faith in divine protection and their attempts to ward off malign forces.

4. **Broader Understanding and Essence of Apotropaic Magic**
Taking into account all these factors, the ancient cultures of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece showcase the diverse yet fundamentally interconnected nature of apotropaic magic. While specific practices differed, they shared a common belief in supernatural forces, the use of protective symbols and rituals, and the power of divine protection.

In conclusion, the essence of apotropaic magic lies in its core human belief in the existence of harmful supernatural influences and the need for protection. Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Greek civilizations all employed unique symbols, rituals, and beliefs to practice apotropaic magic, but their underlying goals were fundamentally the same. Furthermore, these systems of protection reflect the cultural, religious, and societal norms of each civilization, providing a broader understanding of the omnipresent nature of apotropaic magic throughout history.
