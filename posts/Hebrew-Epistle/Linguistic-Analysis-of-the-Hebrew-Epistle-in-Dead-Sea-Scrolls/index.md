The Hebrew Epistle within the Dead Sea Scrolls is a fascinating source for studying both the language's evolution and the cultural context of its time. This analysis will focus on the linguistic structure of the Hebrew Epistle, comparing it to other contemporaneous texts, and considering the sociolinguistic implications of scribal practices and transmission processes. 

**Syntax**:
The syntax of the Hebrew Epistle is characterized by its reliance on the VSO (verb-subject-object) word order, typical of Biblical Hebrew. However, some sentences demonstrate a slight deviation, adopting an SVO (subject-verb-object) order, which is indicative of an evolving language. The usage of the definite article "ה" (ha) is also worth noting, as its function differs slightly from other texts of the same period. In some cases, the Hebrew Epistle appears to rely less on the definite article, potentially indicating a shift in syntactic preferences.

**Morphology**:
Morphologically, the Hebrew Epistle exhibits standard Biblical Hebrew patterns, including the use of triconsonantal roots and verbal inflection forms (such as qal, niph'al, and piel). **However, there are instances where the text diverges from the norm**: some verb forms appear to be closer to those found in later Mishnaic Hebrew, and there is evidence of phonological shifts, such as the transformation of the Proto-Semitic /θ/ into /ʃ/.

Semantic properties:
The vocabulary of the Hebrew Epistle is relatively standard, incorporating words and expressions typical of contemporaneous Hebrew texts. However, certain idiomatic uses and expressions appear to be unique to this particular text, possibly reflecting regional or cultural differences. For example, the use of the word "שמע" (shema) is noteworthy, in that it is employed not only in its typical meaning of "listen" or "hear," but also metaphorically to represent understanding or accepting a message.

Comparison to contemporaneous Hebrew texts:
When comparing the Hebrew Epistle to other texts of the same period, it becomes evident that certain deviations are present. Although many features are shared across different texts, the Hebrew Epistle displays some unique linguistic elements, as mentioned in the discussion of syntax, morphology, and semantic properties. These differences may be attributed to regional or cultural factors, or various authorial tendencies.

Sociolinguistic context:
The sociolinguistic context of the Hebrew Epistle's composition is crucial in understanding its linguistic peculiarities. **The Dead Sea Scrolls were written by members of the Essene community, who sought to maintain their distinct identity from mainstream Judaism. Consequently, the Hebrew Epistle reflects specific scribal practices particular to this group, including the use of a unique calendrical system and specialized terminology with esoteric meanings. Additionally, the transmission process of the text implies that oral and written traditions likely influenced linguistic features**: as scribes copied and recopied texts, introducing their stylistic idiosyncrasies or local dialectical influences, a diverse range of linguistic phenomenon would emerge.

In conclusion, an in-depth analysis of the linguistic structure of the Hebrew Epistle within the Dead Sea Scrolls reveals a complex interplay between syntax, morphology, and semantics. While the text shares many similarities with other contemporaneous Hebrew texts, it also exhibits unique linguistic features that set it apart. The sociolinguistic context of its time, shaped by scribal practices and transmission processes, helps account for these distinctive characteristics.
