excerpt: > 
  Compose a hauntingly eerie poem in iambic pentameter, invoking the ancient and malevolent power of the Dark Goddess Hecate. The poem should include sinister incantations, frightening creatures of the night, and vivid imagery of your descent into the underworld to call upon her evil might. Be sure to incorporate specific symbols and artifacts associated with Hecate, such as the torch, the key, and the serpent. Additionally, emphasize her domain over crossroads, necromancy, and forbidden knowledge as you craft a chilling ode to her unholy reign.

In darkened woods, where shadows twist and twine,
'Neath blood-red moon, I tread the path arcane
To call upon the mistress of the night,
The key, the snake, the torch that lights the way.

In mournful tones and sinister incant,
I weave the spell that echoes through the gloom,
And from the depths of blackest night, they crawl,
The spectral hounds and monstrous, haunting shapes.

Emerge, oh ancient one of countless names,
Dark Hecate, the Queen of witches' bane,
From crossroads dread, the liminal and veiled,
Reveal thy visage, grant me thine embrace.

Like serpents' hiss, thy secrets coil and wind,
The dead have whispered of thy fearsome might,
To thee, with key and torch, the paths unfold,
The realm of shades obeys thy dread command.

Forsaken knowledge, dark and terrible,
Forlorn illusions, banished truths, untold,
In dread defiance of the sunlit realm,
I supplicate thy wisdom, oh fell Queen.

I stand before thy portal to the grave,
Beseech the key to open wide the gate,
Bring forth the spectres of unholy birth,
To rend the veil of life and taste the dark.

Thy triple-headed gaze, it pierces me,
Enshrouds my form in mysteries unknown,
I feel thy coiled embrace, the serpent's grip,
And in my blood surges thy wicked force.

Hail Hecate, the sovereign of the night,
The conjured spirits kneel; the shadows bow,
By thy malefic power, my fell decree,
Let chaos reign in thy infernal name.
