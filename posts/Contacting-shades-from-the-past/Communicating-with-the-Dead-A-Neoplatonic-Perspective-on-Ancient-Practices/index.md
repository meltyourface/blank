To answer this knowledge challenge, let us begin by examining the various methods and techniques that have historically been employed to summon and communicate with shades from the past. We will then explore the Neoplatonic concept of the World Soul and demonstrate how intertwining this perspective with these time-honored practices can lead to a deeper understanding of their spiritual and psychological implications.

Throughout history, various cultures and traditions have developed unique methods and practices to communicate with the shades from the past. **Here are some of the most compelling examples**:

1. **Necromancy**: This ancient practice involves summoning the spirits of the dead for divination or knowledge-gathering purposes. It has been practiced across different cultures, including the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Methods of necromancy often include the use of rituals, prayers, and offerings to establish contact with the deceased.

2. **Mediumship**: This practice involves a person, known as the medium, who serves as a conduit for communication between the living and the dead. Spirit mediums have appeared in cultures worldwide, from ancient shamanic traditions to Victorian-era spiritualism. Techniques often involve entering into a trance-like state, in which the medium allows the spirit to speak or act through them.

3. **Ancestral worship and veneration**: In various cultures, venerating one's ancestors is a deeply-rooted spiritual practice. Offerings, prayers, and rituals are often conducted to honor the deceased and seek their guidance or protection. These practices can be seen in traditions such as Chinese ancestor worship and the African concept of the 'communion of saints.'

Now, let us turn to the Neoplatonic concept of the World Soul. The World Soul, or Anima Mundi, is a cosmic principle introduced by Plato and further elaborated by Neoplatonist philosophers such as Plotinus and Proclus. According to this philosophy, the World Soul is a universal, unifying force that interconnects the entire cosmos and all living beings within it. It serves as the intermediary between the transcendent realm of the divine and the manifest world of physical forms.

By interweaving the concept of the World Soul with the aforementioned summoning and communication practices, we can derive several spiritual and psychological insights:

a) Unity and interconnectedness: The World Soul suggests that all living beings, including shades from the past, are interconnected through a web of spiritual and energetic relations. This perspective deepens our understanding of why connecting with the deceased might be valuable, as it reinforces the sense of unity and continuity between the living and the non-living.
 
b) The transformative power of knowledge: When summoning shades from the past, the primary aim is often to acquire knowledge or insights that can help people progress on their spiritual journey or address personal challenges. This aligns with the Neoplatonic emphasis on the importance of acquiring wisdom and using it as a catalyst for spiritual transformation and self-realization.

c) The role of the individual in the cosmic order: The Neoplatonic understanding of the World Soul underscores each individual's responsibility to actively engage with and contribute to the spiritual cosmos. Summoning and communicating with shades from the past can help individuals refine their spiritual practice and understand their distinct, interconnected role within the grand design of the cosmos.

In summary, historically, there are numerous methods, like necromancy, mediumship, and ancestral worship, that have been employed to summon and communicate with shades from the past. Integrating these practices with the Neoplatonic concept of the World Soul allows for a profound comprehension of their spiritual and psychological implications, highlighting themes such as unity, interconnectedness, the transformative power of knowledge, and the individual's role within the cosmic order.
