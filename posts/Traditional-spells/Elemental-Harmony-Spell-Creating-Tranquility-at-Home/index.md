In order to design a spell that combines the principles of sympathetic magic, correspondence, elemental association, and adheres to the ethical considerations of the Threefold Law, we must first understand the foundational concepts of each of these aspects and their role in traditional witchcraft.

1. Sympathetic Magic: This principle is based on the idea that like attracts like. By using objects that symbolically represent the desired outcome, the practitioner can draw the desired energies or changes toward themselves or the intended target. 

2. Correspondence: This involves the understanding and use of the relationships between different objects, symbols, and materials. In spellwork, certain elements are believed to share a connection or correspondence with specific energies, powers or intentions.

3. Elemental Association: This principle works with the classical elements (earth, air, fire, and water) and their connections to specific energies, emotions, or other aspects within the natural world. By incorporating elements into a spell, practitioners can call upon the innate powers they hold in order to achieve the desired outcome.

4. Threefold Law: This ethical guideline states that whatever energy or intention a practitioner sends out into the universe will come back to them three times stronger. It serves as a reminder to always be mindful of the consequences of one's actions, particularly in a magical context.

With these definitions in mind, let's craft a spell that effectively combines all the components and adheres to the ethical considerations. This spell aims to invoke harmony, balance, and tranquility within a living space by working with each of the four elements.

Spell: Harmonious Home Elemental Blessing

Ingredients and tools:
- Earth: A small dish containing soil or salt
- Air: A feather or incense
- Fire: A candle (preferably white or violet)
- Water: A small bowl of water
- A pentacle or other symbol representing the harmonious integration of the elements

Step-by-step process:

1. Choose a central, quiet location within the living space where the spell will be performed. This location should symbolically represent the heart of the space and should be relatively free from clutter and distractions.

2. As a representation of the earth element, place the dish containing the soil or salt in the center of the chosen location.

3. Light the candle (fire element) and set it on the east side of the earth dish, signifying the energy of beginnings and inspiration.

4. Place the bowl of water (water element) on the west side of the earth dish, symbolizing the energy of emotional depth and intuition.

5. Set the feather or incense (air element) on the north side of the earth dish to represent intellect, communication, and clarity.

6. Draw or place the pentacle or elemental symbol in the south, to signify the harmonious connection and balance between the elements.

7. Stand in the center and focus on the intention to bring harmony, balance, and tranquility into the living space. Visualize the energies of the four elements converging and swirling together in a spiral of light.

8. Recite a simple incantation or affirmation that resonates with the intention of harmony, balance, and tranquility.

9. Close the spell by expressing gratitude to the elements and any energies or powers that have been called upon.

10. Leave the elemental representations in place for at least a full day and night, allowing time for their energies to permeate the space.

To summarize, this Harmonious Home Elemental Blessing spell effectively integrates the principles of sympathetic magic, correspondence, and elemental association, while following the ethical guidelines of the Threefold Law. By invoking harmony and balance within a living space, this spell encourages practical and positive outcomes that benefit all inhabitants, and by extension, the practitioner. By adhering to ethical considerations, the practitioner ensures that the energies set forth are benevolent, making the spell both effective and responsible.
