Introducing the "Vortex Cipher"
=========================

The Vortex Cipher is a unique and innovative cipher code that utilizes a distinct set of symbols combined with a combination rotation system to create an intriguing and secure method for encoding and decoding messages.

The Symbol Set
-----------------
The Vortex Cipher employs a set of 64 distinct symbols, consisting of the following:

1. The 26 lowercase letters of the modern English alphabet (a-z)
2. The 10 digits (0-9)
3. The following 28 special characters:
   ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) - _ = + [ ] { } ; : ' " , . < > / ? |

Encoding and Decoding Mechanisms
--------------------------------------
The Vortex Cipher utilizes an encoding and decoding method based on a combination rotation system. The key to this cipher is a "vortex map," a unique grid composed of 8 rows and 8 columns, each cell containing one of the 64 symbols in a random arrangement. Each symbol in the map should appear only once.

1. To encode a message, locate the corresponding symbol for each character in the vortex map. Note down the row and column number for each character.
   Example: If the symbol 'a' is found in row 2 and column 3, note it down as (2, 3).

2. For each pair of coordinates, rotate the numbers based on the following rules:
   - The first number (row) is rotated left by N positions, where N is the second number (column) of the pair.
   - The second number (column) is rotated left by N positions, where N is the first number (row) of the pair.

3. Use the newly obtained row and column numbers to locate the encoded symbols in the vortex map.

4. To decode a message, simply reverse the rotation process.

The Example Message
----------------------
Let's use the phrase "Hello, world!" to demonstrate the Vortex Cipher encoding and decoding process. We will use the following randomly generated vortex map for demonstration purposes:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   ________________
1 |J 2 , K f # n 7|
2 |6 d 1 9 b p ^ Y|
3 |( j I 8 l A L 0|
4 |- i m s U y _ B|
5 |5 V P h r z C c|
6 |u a e W ? G 4 :]
7 |v w Q ! M Z T 3|
8 |F E R k H x ; N|

**Encoding**:
---------
1. Locate the characters in the vortex map:
   H (8, 5), e (6, 3), l (3, 5), l (3, 5), o (3, 2), , (1, 3),   (1, 1), w (7,
   2), o (3, 2), r (5, 5), l (3, 5), d (2, 2), ! (7, 4)

2. Rotate the coordinate pairs:
   E1 (3, 8), 6EQ (9, 3), (8, 2), (8, 2), %> (5, 3), 1E3 (4, 1), 11 (2, 1), 7
   !2 (9, 7), %> (5, 3), 555 (10, 5), (8, 2), 22 (4, 2), VB4 (11, 7)

3. Locate the corresponding encoded symbols in the vortex map:
   The encoded message is: "%c6Y2>5<5)<93<J9QZ"

**Decoding**:
---------
1. Reverse the rotation process for each coordinate pair:
   E1 (3, 8) -> H (8, 5)
   6EQ (9, 3) -> e (6, 3)
   (8, 2) -> l (3, 5)
   (8, 2) -> l (3, 5)
   %> (5, 3) -> o (3, 2)
   1E3 (4, 1) -> , (1, 3)
   11 (2, 1) ->   (1, 1)
   7!2 (9, 7) -> w (7, 2)
   %> (5, 3) -> o (3, 2)
   555 (10, 5) -> r (5, 5)
   (8, 2) -> l (3, 5)
   22 (4, 2) -> d (2, 2)
   VB4 (11, 7) -> ! (7, 4)

2. Retrieve the original message:
   The decoded message is: "Hello, world!"
