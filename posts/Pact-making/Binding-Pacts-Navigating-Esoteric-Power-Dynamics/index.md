To fully respond to this knowledge challenge, we must first examine the context of history's most renowned pact-makers, delve into the complexities of sigil crafting, explore the influence of astral realms, and address the notion of personal accountability in creating a binding pact with a non-human entity. The far-reaching implications of intertwining these elements will be analyzed from both micro and macro perspectives.

The history of pact-making has been shaped by various renowned practitioners like King Solomon, Johann Faust, and even fictional characters like Goethe's Faust. These pact-makers sought knowledge, power, or material wealth, often at a steep cost. Their stories often serve as cautionary tales of hubris, ambition, and unintended consequences.

Sigil crafting is a vital component of pact-making. It involves the creation of symbols or images that carry power and intent, serving as anchors between the practitioner and the non-human entity. These sigils encapsulate the terms of the pact, outlining the responsibilities and obligations of the involved parties. As a form of esoteric language, sigils operate beyond the limitations of spoken or written words, transcending cultural, and linguistic barriers.

Astral realms, on the other hand, refer to metaphysical dimensions beyond the physical plane. These realms are inhabited by a diverse range of non-human entities that practitioners can tap into for a variety of purposes, such as acquiring supernatural abilities, guidance, or protection. Engaging with the astral plane requires skill, understanding, and caution, as one must navigate the complexities of connecting with these powerful and often unpredictable forces.

Personal accountability is an essential aspect of pact-making. In entering a binding agreement with a non-human entity, the practitioner willingly takes on the consequences of their actions, whether positive or negative. This accountability is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the pact and ensuring adherence to its terms.

When intertwining the complexities of sigil crafting, astral realms, and personal accountability, several far-reaching implications arise. 

Firstly, the act of creating a binding pact with a non-human entity necessitates a deep understanding of esoteric concepts and methodologies. An intricately crafted sigil, as well as adept astral navigation, demonstrates mastery in the occult art of pact-making and displays the practitioner's commitment and respect for the process.

Secondly, the inherently symbolic nature of sigil crafting and the abstract quality of astral realms blur the boundaries of reality and perception for the practitioner. This ambiguity may lead to unforeseen or unintended consequences, demanding a high degree of self-reflection and personal responsibility from the practitioner. The narrative of Goethe's Faust demonstrates the protagonist's lack of foresight and misjudgment, which culminate in catastrophic outcomes.

Finally, the intertwining of these elements gives rise to an overarching theme of power dynamics. The practitioner's desires may conflict with the intentions or preferences of the non-human entity, creating a delicate negotiation process. The outcomes of these pacts often reveal the strengths, weaknesses, and morality of the human practitioners, as well as the limits of humanity when faced with otherworldly powers.

In conclusion, the far-reaching implications of intertwining sigil crafting, astral realms, and personal accountability when establishing a binding pact with a non-human entity include a deeper understanding and mastery of esoteric concepts, navigating the blurred boundaries of reality and perception, and negotiating power dynamics between human and non-human entities. These complexities demonstrate the immense responsibility and potential consequences pact-makers must bear in engaging with these powerful and often enigmatic forces, ultimately serving as both a cautionary tale and an invitation to explore the limits of human potential.
