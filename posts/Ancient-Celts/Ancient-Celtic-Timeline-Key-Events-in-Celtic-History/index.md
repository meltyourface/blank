  Create an intricate, annotated timeline detailing the various movements and territorial expansions of the Ancient Celtic tribes, including key migrations, conflicts, and conquests during their early and later periods, while also unraveling their influence on neighboring cultures. Incorporate primary and secondary sources, as well as archaeological findings, to provide a comprehensive and rich understanding of the Ancient Celts' societal development and shifting power dynamics.

While condensing such a vast and varied history into a small space is a challenge, I shall do my utmost to provide an annotated timeline outlining key moments in Ancient Celtic history.

**1200 BCE** - Hallstatt Culture emerges, associated with the early Celts.

**900 BCE** - The Iron Age begins, leading to a widespread adoption of iron tools and weapons by Celtic tribes.

**800 BCE** - La Tène Culture develops, marking the Late Celtic Iron Age and the spread of more advanced art, weaponry, and technology.

**600 BCE** - Early Greek sources, such as Hecataeus of Miletus, begin documenting the Celts throughout Europe by referring to them as "Keltoi."

**450 BCE** - Herodotus, the Greek historian, writes about the Celts living beyond the Pillars of Hercules (the Strait of Gibraltar).

**390 BCE** - Celts sack Rome, marking the first significant migration and conflict evidenced in historical records.

**336 BCE** - Alexander the Great encounters Celtic mercenaries in the Balkans, demonstrating the importance of their warrior class and their involvement in conflicts outside their native territories.

**279 BCE** - Celts led by Brennus invade Greece and sack Delphi, expanding their influence into southeastern Europe.

**250 BCE** – Galatian Celts migrate to Asia Minor under the invitation of Nicomedes I of Bithynia, establishing a Celtic presence in Asia.

**225 BCE** - The Celts are defeated by the Romans at the Battle of Telamon, a major conflict determining the balance of power in the region.

**58-50 BCE** - Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul, culminating in the Battle of Alesia in 52 BCE, results in the subjugation of most Celtic tribes within the region.

**43 CE** - The Roman invasion of Britain begins, leading to the eventual incorporation of the majority of the British Isles into the Roman Empire.

**100 CE** - Christianity begins to spread among Celtic populations across Europe.

**400 CE** - Collapse of the Western Roman Empire forces Celtic Britons to repel Germanic invaders, leading to the legends surrounding King Arthur.

**500–800 CE** - "The Age of Saints" in Ireland, as Christian monks and missionaries work to preserve and spread knowledge, transmitting Celtic language, law, history, and culture.

**795 CE** - Viking raids begin in the British Isles, leading to a long period of conflict and cultural exchange between Celts and Norse.

**800 CE** - The Book of Kells is created, combining Celtic and Christian art motifs in a highly ornate illuminated manuscript of the Gospels.

For primary sources, consult works such as "The Commentaries" by Julius Caesar and "The Histories" by Tacitus, which give first-hand accounts of Celtic history. Secondary sources encompass a wide range of modern historical texts, while archaeological sources include items and artifacts from Hallstatt, La Tène, and other essential Celtic sites.

Remember, this is a highly condensed version of Ancient Celtic history, and there are many more stories and events to explore.
