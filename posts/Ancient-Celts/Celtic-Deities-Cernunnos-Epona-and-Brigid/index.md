In this response, we will analyze and compare three prominent Celtic deities - Cernunnos, Epona, and Brigid - in terms of the symbolism, mythology, connections with other ancient cultures, and their impact on the spiritual practices of the Ancient Celts. 

1. ****Cernunnos****: The Horned God 

Cernunnos is a horned god, also known as the Lord of the Animals or the God of Nature in Celtic mythology. He is depicted with antlers, usually sitting in a meditative pose surrounded by animals. Cernunnos represents the natural world and its cycle of life, death, and rebirth. His characteristic horns symbolize fertility and masculine virility. 

Cernunnos is often associated with the Green Man, a vegetative deity found in many mythologies. The antlers that adorn his head are reminiscent of the Greco-Roman god Pan or the Indian deity Pashupati. His portrayal as a horned god initiates a connection to the shamanic traditions of prehistoric Europe and the Indo-European cultures, with shamanic figures often wearing horns or antlers as part of their ceremonial attire. 

The worship of Cernunnos as the god of nature reflects the ancient Celts' respect for the natural environment, highlighting their dependency on the land for sustenance, guidance, and spiritual sustenance. In the modern-day, Cernunnos has been embraced by neo-pagans and Wiccans, who consider him a representative of the masculine divine.

2. ****Epona****: The Horse Goddess

Epona is the Celtic goddess of horses, fertility, and sovereignty. In Celtic art, she is portrayed as riding a horse, either side-saddle or on a mare with accompanying foals. Epona displays her intimate connection to the animal world, particularly horses, which were vital for Celtic societies' transportation, warfare, and agricultural practices. Her association with fertility makes her a nurturer and a life-giver, while her link to sovereignty establishes her as a protector of the tribes and their rulers.

Epona shares similarities with several deities from other Indo-European cultures. The Rigveda, an ancient Indian collection of hymns, describes the horse goddess Ushas, often associated with dawn or fertility. In Greco-Roman mythology, Rhea, the mother of the gods, is sometimes depicted riding a chariot pulled by lions, an image parallel to Epona's equine associations. The emphasis on Epona's horse symbolism reveals the Celtic people's admiration for equine prowess, which was practically and symbolically significant in their lives.

Epona's worship had a profound influence on the spiritual practices of the Celts. They honored her by maintaining and adorning horses and incorporating them in various rituals and ceremonies. The cult of Epona persisted in regions that were part of the Roman Empire, emphasizing her enduring impact on Celtic spirituality.

3. ****Brigid****: The Triple Goddess

Brigid is a Celtic goddess of many facets, including healing, poetry, and smithcraft, symbolizing the divine feminine and the essence of creativity. She is often depicted as a triple goddess, representing the maiden, mother, and crone aspects or the three stages of a woman's life.

Her varied roles connect her to other goddesses of wisdom and inspiration across Indo-European mythologies, such as the Greek Athena, Roman Minerva, or the Hindu Saraswati. She is a conduit of divine knowledge, and her mastery of various arts underscores her association with skill and craftsmanship. 

Brigid's presence in the Celtic pantheon showcases the high esteem attributed to arts and human creativity, in addition to emphasizing the nurturing aspects of femininity. Her association with fire, as seen in her role as the goddess of the hearth or the forge, underlines the transformational aspects of her nature and the purifying qualities associated with her worship.

In conclusion, Cernunnos, Epona, and Brigid are three prominent Celtic deities that embody different aspects of the ancient Celtic worldview. Cernunnos, the horned god, exemplifies the reverence for the natural world and the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. Epona, the horse goddess, highlights the importance of horses and the symbolic power of fertility and sovereignty. Brigid, the triple goddess, encapsulates the divine feminine, creativity, and the transformative energy of fire. Their connections with deities from other ancient cultures showcase the shared human experience in those times, illustrating commonalities in the reverence for life, nature, fertility, and creativity that transcend regional boundaries. Finally, their lasting impact on modern spirituality and the continued practice of various contemporary pagan or neo-pagan traditions emphasizes their profound influence on the spiritual development of the Ancient Celts and beyond.
