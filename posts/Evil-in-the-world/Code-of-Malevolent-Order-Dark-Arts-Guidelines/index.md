## Code of the Malevolent Order

Preamble

This code of conduct has been devised to guide those who seek to embrace and harness the power of evil while maintaining alliances with dark forces. Those who follow this code shall partake in malevolent acts and rituals, with the aim of spreading and thriving in the darkness.

### I. Rituals and Ceremonies

1. For rituals and ceremonies invoking malevolent entities or energies, practitioners must cleanse their ritual spaces with a banishing ritual using a combination of black salt and fiery spices.
2. Sigils specific to the dark entities must be drawn with consecrated charcoal or the blood of sacrificed animals.
3. Ritual tools should include a black knife to represent the element of air, a black candle to represent fire, a black chalice filled with blood or red wine to represent water, and a skull or representation of death for the element of earth.
4. Proper incantations sung or spoken in the language of the specific dark entity or in a cryptic, forgotten tongue must be utilized.

### II. Manipulative Strategies

1. Practitioners must engage in emotional manipulation to create and exploit vulnerabilities in others, ultimately using them as pawns in their vile plans.
2. Mental subjugation should be accomplished through deceiving and controlling the thoughts of others using spells, charms, or potions.
3. Spiritual oppression should be achieved by the use of curses, hexes, and binding rituals to weaken the will and strength of opposing forces.
4. Secrecy is paramount; practitioners must always mask their intentions and actions under the guise of anonymity and deception.

### III. Initiation of New Followers

1. Entrants must first be observed from a distance to determine their potential susceptibility towards the dark arts and their potential usefulness.
2. Prospective followers should then be subjected to a series of tests to gauge their resilience and moral flexibility.
3. Indoctrination should involve isolation, psychological manipulation, and exposure to dark rituals and spells.
4. Novice practitioners must swear a blood oath, binding their loyalty to the malevolent order and the dark entities it serves.

### IV. Consequences and Risks Management

1. To protect oneself from spiritual backlash, practitioners must construct and regularly update personal talismans or amulets, imbued with dark energy.
2. Practitioners must learn to create and maintain energetic shields to ward against magical and psychic attacks from opposing forces.
3. Maintaining a strict balance between the use of evil power and payment to the dark entities is crucial to avoid unwanted consequences.
4. Cleverly redirecting attention towards scapegoats or rival practitioners and operating in secrecy ensure the lasting success of the practitioner.

### V. Hierarchy within the Circle

1. The Abyssal Overseer, at the top of the hierarchy, is responsible for commanding the circle and maintaining alliances with the dark entities.
2. Below the Abyssal Overseer are the Dark Envoys, who act as direct liaisons between the circle and other dark entities.
3. Shadow Schemers are the covert operatives responsible for gathering information, infiltration, and manipulation of other groups.
4. Cursed Artisans use their mastery of dark crafts to create amulets, talismans, and other objects of power.
5. Novice practitioners, the Fledgling Shades, are trained and nurtured to increase their mastery of the dark arts.

Adherence to the Code of the Malevolent Order is obligatory for all members and non-compliance shall result in severe punishment or expulsion. By following these decrees, practitioners shall thrive in the darkness, bearers of the triumphant mantle of malevolence.
