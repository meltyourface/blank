H.R. Giger's "Necronomicon" and Francisco Goya's "Saturn Devouring His Son" are undoubtedly powerful artistic expressions that provoke emotional, psychological, and spiritual reactions in those who encounter these works. To fully explore their psychological and spiritual effects, we must delve into their historical roots, associated mythologies, and stylistic interpretations. 

**Historical Roots**: 
H.R. Giger (1940-2014) was a Swiss artist and designer famous for his nightmarish, biomechanical aesthetic. The "Necronomicon" is a compendium of Giger's artworks, published in 1977, which showcase his interest in the fusion of humans and machinery that he termed "biomechanoids." Throughout his career, Giger explored themes of death, sexuality, and technology â€“ all of which are evident in the "Necronomicon." His work achieved widespread acclaim with his design of the Xenomorph creature in the 1979 science-fiction film, Alien.

Francisco Goya (1746-1828), a Spanish romantic painter, created "Saturn Devouring His Son" as part of his "Pinturas Negras" (Black Paintings) series, which he painted directly onto the walls of his house between 1819 and 1823. Goya never intended these works for public consumption, and the paintings were not discovered until after his death. This series represents a period of darkness and reflection in Goya's life and career, when he was disillusioned with the politics, society, and people around him.

**Associated Mythologies**: 
"Necronomicon" takes its name from the fictional grimoire of the same name, a tome of dark magic and forbidden knowledge in the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Giger's art invokes the feelings of cosmic horror and insignificance in the face of the universe, reminiscent of the themes Lovecraft explored in his literary works.

"Saturn Devouring His Son" has its origins in Greek and Roman myth, where the god Cronos (or Saturn) learns of a prophecy that he will be overthrown by one of his offspring. To prevent this, he devours each of his children as they are born. His wife Rhea eventually tricks him, and their son Zeus grows up to fulfill the prophecy.

**Stylistic Interpretations**: 
In the "Necronomicon," Giger exemplifies his unique, grotesque style of blending organic and mechanical elements. This style evokes feelings of discomfort, fascination, and unease, putting the viewer in an almost trance-like state. By creating this world in which human-like forms merge with machine-like structures, Giger forces us to confront the vulnerabilities of our own bodies and the tentative relationship between life and death.

"Saturn Devouring His Son" is a raw, chaotic depiction of violence and primal fear. Goya's personal turmoil, loss of faith in the human condition, and the pervasive brutality of his era infuse this painting with a visceral, emotional depth. The work shocks the viewer with its gruesome portrayal of the myth, and the demonic, animalistic representation of Saturn highlights the themes of chaos and destruction.

Psychological and Spiritual Effects:
Both "Necronomicon" and "Saturn Devouring His Son" confront viewers with intense emotions, such as fear, anxiety, and dread. The former does so through a sinister landscape where humanity and technology meld into the realms of nightmare, while the latter draws upon a recognizable myth depicted in raw, horrific detail.

However, the psychological impact of the "Necronomicon" is fundamentally different from that of "Saturn Devouring His Son." Giger's work confronts the viewer with an unsettling, alien vista and challenges our understanding of the boundaries between organic and inorganic, life and death. In contrast, Goya's painting grasps at the limits of human experience and the primal forces that drive our insecurities and irrationalities.

Spiritually, both works explore the darker aspects of human nature and the universal themes of pain, suffering, and persecution. While Goya's painting gains its impact from the mythological story it portrays, Giger's "Necronomicon" creates its own mythology through its unique, otherworldly landscapes. 

In conclusion, although H.R. Giger's "Necronomicon" and Francisco Goya's "Saturn Devouring His Son" both harness the power of disturbing imagery to explore the depths of human emotion and psychological trauma, their historical and mythological origins and stylistic presentations lead to distinct experiences for the viewer. Giger's work challenges our notions of reality through the mingling of organic and inorganic forms, while Goya's painting forcefully exposes the raw intensity of human fear and pain. Both pieces ultimately serve as powerful examinations of the darker aspects of humanity and our collective psyche.
