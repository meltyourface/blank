To answer this challenge, we must first understand the nature of the various elements we are discussing, establish their respective contexts, and explore relationships between them. **The three main elements to consider are**:

1. Symbolic interpretations of oracles, prophecies, and ancient mythological beings.
2. The concept of time travel.
3. The concept of interdimensional visitors.

To explore the correlations between these elements, we will examine the following three distinct historical, cultural, or esoteric traditions:

A. Greek and Roman mythology
B. Hindu mythology and religious texts
C. Native American myths and legends

A. Greek and Roman mythology

Greek and Roman mythology features numerous instances of prophecies and oracles that suggest a connection to time travel and interdimensional visitors. One prominent example is the Oracle of Delphi, considered the most powerful oracle in the ancient world. The Oracle's priestess, known as the Pythia, showcased the ability to access divine knowledge and insights about the past and future events. The source of this knowledge was believed to be Apollo, the god of prophecy and truth. The connection between divine beings and humans was displayed in a way that could suggest the involvement of interdimensional visitors. The stories of time manipulation are also present, as seen in the myth of Cronus, the god of time.

B. Hindu mythology and religious texts

The Hindu religious texts, particularly the Vedas and the Puranas, contain multiple references to time travel and interdimensional beings. The concept of 'Kala' or time is inherent in various Hindu myths, and it's linked with cosmic cycles and the creation and destruction of the universe. 

One of the most famous examples is the myth of King Kakudmi and his daughter Revati from the Bhagavata Purana. The story illustrates the concept of time dilation, where Kakudmi and Revati travel to Brahmaloka (realm of the creator god, Brahma) to find a suitable husband for Revati. When they return to Earth, they realize that many ages have passed even though only a short time passed for them in Brahmaloka.

Another example is the narrative of the Vimanas, which are flying vehicles or chariots described in ancient Sanskrit texts. These mythical aircraft suggest an advanced level of technology and are sometimes linked to extraterrestrial beings or interdimensional visitors.

C. Native American myths and legends

Native American traditions feature numerous stories involving time travel and interdimensional beings. The concept of time is often non-linear, with past, present, and future becoming intertwined. One example is the Hopi legend of the kachinas, spirit beings who visit the tribe as messengers and teachers. They represent ancestral spirits and natural forces and are believed to travel between the spiritual and physical realms. This connection between spiritual and physical worlds points towards the possibility of interdimensional visitors.

Connecting the themes

The correlation between the symbolic interpretations of oracles, prophecies, and ancient mythological beings with concepts of time travel and interdimensional visitors can be seen across these distinct historical, cultural, and esoteric traditions. **In each case, we observe that**:

1. Oracles and prophecies in these mythologies are often bestowed upon humankind by divine or supernatural figures, suggesting a transfer of knowledge between different realms or dimensions.
2. Time manipulation and journeys through time are closely linked with the divine, cosmic cycles, and higher beings positing that such events are outcomes of interaction with otherworldly or interdimensional entities.
3. The presence of mythical vehicles, beings, or artifacts that defy the understanding of ancient civilizations may point to advanced technology or the intervention of extraterrestrial or interdimensional visitors.

In summary, the correlation between the elements of symbolic interpretations of oracles, prophecies, and ancient mythological beings and the concepts of time travel and interdimensional visitors can be found across Greek and Roman mythology, Hindu mythology and religious texts, and Native American myths and legends. These connections imply that such mythologies might have encoded genuine encounters with otherworldly beings or advanced knowledge of the universe, which is reflected in their narrative structures and symbolic representations.
