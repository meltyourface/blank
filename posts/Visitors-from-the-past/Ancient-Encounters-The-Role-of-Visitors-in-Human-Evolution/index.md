After delving into the ancient texts and meticulously cataloguing and cross-referencing the various occurrences of Visitors from the past throughout history, I have uncovered some intriguing insights. Here, I present those findings and their potential connections to support an in-depth understanding of the complex relationship between humanity and these otherworldly beings. 

1. **Sumerians (Mesopotamia, circa 4500–1900 BCE)**: Among the earliest known references to Visitors from the past can be found in the ancient Sumerian texts. They spoke of the Anunnaki, a group of deities, often attributed with supernatural abilities and considered as gods by ancient humans. Their influences included technology, agriculture, and governance. Some scholars have suggested that their close resemblance to humans might indicate a potential extraterrestrial origin, guiding humanity throughout its early development.

2. **Ancient Egypt (circa 3150–30 BCE)**: The Egyptian civilization also had extensive accounts of Visitors from the past, particularly with the mention of their gods possessing advanced capabilities. For instance, Ra, the sun god, was believed to have given humans the knowledge of complex geometry and celestial navigation necessary to build the pyramids. Additionally, ancient texts describe flying entities and ships, indicating advanced technological knowledge and potential interaction with otherworldly beings.

3. **The Greek and Roman period (circa 1100 BCE–476 CE)**: Ancient Greeks and Romans documented the presence of Visitors in their mythology, referring to the gods as entities with supernatural abilities. Greeks believed that their gods resided on Mount Olympus, where they would occasionally visit humans to provide guidance, wisdom, and occasionally, punishment. Among them, Hermes, known as the messenger of the gods, is intriguing, given his seemingly effortless capability to travel between realms. Some have postulated that such mentions might indicate contact with Visitors from the past.

4. **Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica (circa 2000 BCE–1519 CE)**: Across various Mesoamerican civilizations, legends abound of the Feathered Serpent deity, Quetzalcoatl, who was known as Kukulkan among the Maya. Often depicted as a benevolent figure, the deity brought knowledge and innovation, such as the Mayan calendar system and advancements in agriculture. The description of the Feathered Serpent is strikingly similar to other cultures across the world, hinting at a worldwide interaction with unearthly beings in the past.

Comparative analysis of these ancient accounts indicates the presence of immensely powerful and technologically advanced beings who influenced humanity's evolution. While interpretations of these Visitors from the past varied among the different societies, commonalities among them reveal potential connections.

1. **Transformation of human progress**: The Visitors consistently uplifted societies by offering advanced technologies, skills, and knowledge that propelled human civilizations forward. Among all accounts, their influence on agriculture and architecture is among the most noteworthy.

2. **Divine reverence**: The entities were uniformly worshipped as divine figures with extraordinary abilities, superior knowledge, and possibly extraterrestrial origins.

3. **Art and iconography**: Throughout history, cave paintings, sculptures, and texts that reference these Visitors show common physical traits and descriptions of abilities that transcend cultural boundaries.

The analysis of these examples reinforces the notion that human history is heavily influenced by Visitors, whether through direct contact or their enduring legacy. Understanding the nature of their interactions with humanity provides valuable insights into the long-evolving relationship between humanity and these otherworldly beings.
