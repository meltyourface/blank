4. The Descent - Denotes the trials, lessons, or inner work the individual must undergo to grow spiritually and evolve.
5. The Abyss - Symbolizes the dark night of the soul, a point where the individual faces their deepest fears or insecurities.
6. The Revelation - Represents the insights or spiritual truths the individual discovers after facing their fears and emerging stronger.
7. The Integration - Signifies the synthesis of newfound wisdom and experiences into the individual's daily life and spiritual practice.
8. The Ascension - Denotes the individual's progress toward self-mastery, spiritual awakening, and growth.
9. The Transcendence - Represents the individual's achievement of a higher state of consciousness and spiritual fulfillment.
