The intricately designed Crystal Grid of Redemption consists of carefully selected crystals, each possessing unique properties to create powerful energetic purification and a profound experience of Redemption. **To set up this grid and perform the corresponding rituals and affirmations, follow these detailed steps**:

1. ****Choose Your Space****: Select a quiet, undisturbed space for your grid. Clean and cleanse the area both physically and energetically. You can diffuse sage, palo santo, or any cleansing essential oil.

2. ****Gather Your Crystals****: Obtain the following crystals for this grid:
- Clear Quartz (Central Stone): This master amplifier and cleanser will magnify the energy of the grid and enhance the properties of other stones.
- Selenite: A powerful purification crystal that cleanses and charges other stones, selenite also promotes a clear, calm mind.
- Amethyst: Offers spiritual protection, enhances forgiveness and divine connection.
- Black Obsidian: A grounding stone that absorbs negative energy and provides protection.
- Smoky Quartz: A grounding stone as well, which transforms negativity into positivity.
- Rose Quartz: Attracts love and promotes inner healing, self-compassion, and forgiveness.
- Lepidolite: Helps release trauma and supports emotional healing.

3. ****Choose a Sacred Geometry Pattern****: Select the Flower of Life or the Seed of Life as the pattern for your grid. This will serve as the template for crystal placement.

4. ****Cleanse Your Crystals****: Before using your crystals, cleanse them using smudging, sunlight, moonlight, or sound therapy.

5. ****Set Your Intention****: Before arranging the crystals, take a moment to meditate and set a clear intention for your grid.

6. **Set Up the Grid**:
- Place the Clear Quartz at the center of the grid pattern.
- Next, arrange six Amethyst crystals around the Clear Quartz in a hexagonal shape.
- Surround the Amethyst ring with a larger ring of six Selenite pieces and six Black Obsidian pieces (alternating between the two).
- Add another hexagonal ring made up of six Smoky Quartz crystals.
- Position Rose Quartz crystals between each Smoky Quartz, bringing the total of Rose Quartz crystals to six.
- Finally, surround the entire grid with a ring of twelve Lepidolite crystals.

7. ****Activation****: Connect and activate the grid using a clear quartz wand, selenite wand, or your index finger. Start from the central Clear Quartz and move in a spiral pattern, connecting each crystal ring until you reach the outer Lepidolite ring.

8. **Perform the Ritual**:
- Light a white candle to symbolize purity and spiritual cleansing.
- Begin a meditation and imagine a bright white light entering through the crown chakra, cleansing your entire being.
- Visualize any negative energies or old traumas being released and replaced with pure, vibrant light.

9. ****Recite the Affirmation****: Repeat this affirmation three times while maintaining the visualization: "I accept the divine guidance to cleanse my spirit. I release all past traumas, hurt, and pain. I welcome forgiveness, love, and light into my heart. I embrace the profound experience of Redemption."

10. ****Close the Ritual****: Thank the crystals and the divine for their guidance and assistance. Extinguish the white candle.

11. ****Maintenance****: Revisit the grid regularly, meditating on your intention and repeating the affirmation. Cleanse and reactivate the grid once a week or as needed.

By following these steps, you will create an intricate crystal grid layout for energetic purification and achieving the profound experience of Redemption. The corresponding rituals and affirmations will work to amplify the intended effects of this sacred arrangement.
