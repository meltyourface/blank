excerpt: > 
  Compose an intricate poetic invocation in the style of Redemption, dedicated to the higher self and arcane energies, seeking wisdom and support from the enigmatic forces. Incorporate symbolism of the esoteric arts, and explore the deep connection between the hidden realms and human consciousness. Additionally, ensure that the invocation contains at least five verses, each unveiling a unique aspect of the higher self's power and influence.

Verse 1 - The Serpent's Chant
In the shadow of the serpent's coil, I beckon,
Redemption's rhythm resonates within my soul,
Eternal wisdom, ye serpentine mysteries unfold,
As above, so below, the arcane cosmos unspoken,
Higher self, whisper thy secrets, by thee be woken.

Verse 2 - The Alchemist's Resonance
Transmutations deep, within the alchemist's lair,
Astral palettes fuse, elements dance in cosmic flare,
Bridging realms unseen, as the hidden shadows stir,
Seek me in the depths, O spirit, where paradoxes blur,
Guided by thy lantern, may I wield redemption's might and wear.

Verse 3 - The Divine Geometer's Pulse
Solace in sacred geometry, symphony of divine measure,
Within the nucleus of balance, the higher selfâ€™s treasure,
Celestial architect, guide me through the cosmic gates,
In numbers and shapes, unveil the blueprint of fate,
Unraveling esoteric lines, pursue redemption's pleasure.

Verse 4 - The Enchantress' Charm
From the abyss, arise O mistress of enchantment,
Bound to the flow of Aurora's ethereal ligament,
In dreams and whispers, serenade my soul's ascension,
Bathe my essence in astral rivers of redemption,
O higher self, be my compass, in this world of bewilderment.

Verse 5 - The Hierophant's Grimoire
Traverse the maze of the ancient keeper's tomes,
Humble disciple of the esoteric, sanguine roams,
Plead wisdom from the higher self, the hierophant waits,
Through symbols and sigils, sagacity emanates,
Unravel redemption's veil, fuse spirit with mortal homes.
