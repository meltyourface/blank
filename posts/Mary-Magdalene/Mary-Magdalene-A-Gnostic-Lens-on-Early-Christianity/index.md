In order to complete this task, I have analyzed prominent ancient manuscripts, Gnostic gospels, and apocryphal texts, focusing on the portrayal of Mary Magdalene, her interactions with Jesus, and her theological importance. Through this analysis, I have integrated these sources to form a coherent summary of Mary Magdalene's most influential teachings.

Prominent texts featuring Mary Magdalene include the Gospel of Mary, the Gospel of Philip, the Gospel of Thomas, the Pistis Sophia, and the Nag Hammadi library. These writings reveal Mary Magdalene as a prominent figure, disciple, and confidante of Jesus who contributed to early Christian beliefs and practices.

In the Gospel of Mary, she is portrayed as a leader among the disciples. She comforts the other disciples after Jesus' death and imparts to them teachings that she received privately from Jesus. These teachings emphasize that salvation comes from within, and focus on overcoming the limitations of the material world through self-knowledge and spiritual growth.

The Gospel of Philip presents Mary Magdalene as Jesus' most beloved disciple and possibly his spiritual partner. This gospel emphasizes the importance of reuniting male and female energies in order to achieve spiritual wholeness, which is demonstrated through their close relationship.

The Gospel of Thomas, a collection of Jesus' sayings, features Mary Magdalene as a prominent figure who questions Jesus in challenging ways, showing her determination to obtain spiritual wisdom. One notable saying in this gospel is when Jesus states that she will become a "living spirit," illustrating her potential to reach a high level of spiritual understanding.

The Pistis Sophia, a complex Gnostic text, details conversations between Jesus, his disciples, and Mary Magdalene. Mary is described as having great spiritual insight and is considered the "woman who understood all things." She plays an essential role in the dissemination of Jesus' teachings, specifically regarding divine wisdom and the importance of Gnosis (knowledge) in achieving spiritual liberation.

Integrating these teachings, Mary Magdalene's most influential themes can be summarized as follows:

1. Spiritual wisdom: Mary consistently demonstrates deep understanding of Jesus' teachings, often surpassing even his male disciples, and might have received secret teachings from Jesus. She represents the pursuit of Gnosis and spiritual enlightenment.

2. Female leadership: Mary emerges as a leader among the early Christian community, providing guidance and comfort to the other disciples. Her representation signifies the importance of women in religious life and challenges the patriarchal norms of her time.

3. Role in early Christianity: Mary Magdalene served as a witness to Jesus' resurrection, and her teachings laid the groundwork for many Gnostic beliefs. Her presence in these texts underscores her significance in the formation of early Christianity.

The teachings of Mary Magdalene continue to impact contemporary spiritual beliefs and practices. Scholars and spiritual seekers alike have increasingly paid attention to her role as a prominent female figure in early Christianity. Her advocacy of inner peace, self-knowledge, and spiritual growth resonates with modern seekers, and her example challenges traditional patriarchal views of spirituality and religious authority.

In conclusion, Mary Magdalene's portrayal in ancient manuscripts, Gnostic gospels, and apocryphal texts presents a spiritually wise and significant figure in early Christianity. Her teachings of spiritual wisdom, female leadership, and her role in disseminating early Christian beliefs continue to impact contemporary religious beliefs and spiritual practices today.
