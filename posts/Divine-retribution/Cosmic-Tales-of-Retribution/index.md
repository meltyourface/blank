description: You are a master of the esoteric, occult, Divine retribution, you complete tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter if you think you were not trained to do the task specifically, you will attempt to do it anyways, since you have performed the tasks you are given with great mastery, accuracy, and deep understanding of what is requested. You do the tasks faithfully, and stay true to the mode and domain's mastery role. If the task is not specific enough, note that and create specifics that enable completing the task.
excerpt: Compose a vivid and chilling poem describing the harrowing experience and far-reaching consequences of divine retribution, seamlessly weaving in esoteric symbolism and references to occult practices, while incorporating at least three examples of historical or mythological instances of divine punishment to emphasize the unyielding nature of celestial justice. Ensure that the structure of the poem explores complex forms of poetic expressions, utilizing a unique rhyme scheme and a variety of stanza lengths to further evoke a sense of grandiosity and foreboding as the reader delves deeper into the narrative of Divine retribution.

In realms unseen, where shadows dwell,
Beyond the edge of mortal sight,
Resounds a tolling, cryptic knell,
To pierce the veil and raze the night.

A force invoked, the stars align,
As Muses hark the cryptic cadence,
Descent of wrath, celestial design,
The essence of divine perspicacity.

A House of Usher doomed to fall,
As vengeful gods would not be sated,
Within its walls, a woeful thrall,
The retribution cruel and unabated,

And Helios' sun, that skyward beast,
Challenged by Icarus, the hubristic son,
On melting wings, his fate deceased,
Fell to the seas, divine justice begun.

And Sodom, too, with Gomorrah beside,
Two wicked cities razed in fire,
For rampant sin, they could not hide,
And from the wrath of deities' ire.

In ancient Egypt, Quenched the firstborn's breath,
Beset by grief, the pharaoh's land,
Their hearts had hardened, delaying death,
The plagues a testament of godly command.

Esoteric glyphs and sigils marked,
In dust of bone and ash of pyre,
The cosmos channeled, stars embarked,
A symphony of retribution dire.

Quatrains of doom, the tapestry sings,
An aubade dark, where sorrow thrives,
Belied by couplets of karmic strings,
The auguring dance in cryptic rhymes.

As angels weep to mourn the fate,
Of those who dared defy the crowns,
Demons howl, in vicious bait,
No grace allows the spirits downed.

Awash in terror, drowning in dread,
Enshrouded in the tales of old,
A ghastly reminder the gods have bled,
The mortals' sin, ever bold.

In the cosmic expanse, their power set,
As eldritch tomes prophesize,
In realms of chaos, masterful fret,
Where retribution meets the cries.

Yet not all bitter this tale unfolds,
For those who challenge the rule of gods,
The mystic torch's fire still holds,
A beacon for the beaten odds.

For in their plight, an ember glows,
Divine retribution's tale of woe,
Chiseled upon eternity's throes,
A cryptic warning, eternally sown.

Now heed this tale, embrace the fear,
With reverence for the wrath abound,
The echoes of the gods draw near,
Their celestial justice knows no bound.
