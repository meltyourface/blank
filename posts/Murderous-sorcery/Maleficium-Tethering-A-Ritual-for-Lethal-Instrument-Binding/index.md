Ritual Name: Maleficium Tethering

Objective: To tether a lethal instrument to its predestined target using Murderous sorcery, ensuring an infallible connection between the weapon and the victim.
**Step 1**: Prepare the Sacred Space
- Choose a remote location where you won't be interrupted, preferably during a new moon when the veil between the worlds is thinnest.
- Clear the area and draw a large pentagram using a mixture of grave dirt and crushed hematite.
- Surround the pentagram with five black candles to represent the instruments of chaos.
- Burn a mixture of myrrh, henbane, and wormwood to create the scent of death.
**Step 2**: Gather Necessary Materials
- The chosen lethal instrument (e.g., a dagger, sword, or firearm).
- A small personal belonging of the designated victim (e.g., a lock of hair, article of clothing, or photograph).
- The blood of the sorcerer conducting the ritual to form a bond with the weapon.
- A ritual chalice filled with a mixture of red wine, lethal nightshade, and the blood of a venomous snake as an offering to the gods of death.
**Step 3**: Invoke the Obscure Deities
- Recite this incantation to invoke the deities governing murder and death:
  "Hear me, deities of the void, masters of deceit and demise.
   Accept my offering, bind the weapon to the victim's life.
   Silens Mortem, Tenebris Imperium, Nox Aeterna - grant me your unholy alliance as I tether their fate."
**Step 4**: Tether the Weapon to the Victim
- Carve the name of the victim in reverse onto the lethal instrument using a needle dipped in your blood.
- Place the personal belonging of the victim in the center of the pentagram.
- Hold the weapon above the belonging and recite this incantation:
  "As above, so below, this weapon I bestow
   As the moon rises and the seas flow
   Engulf this tool with your wrath and woe
   To the victim's heart, it shall be bestowed"
**Step 5**: Complete the Ritual and Consequences
- Pour the chalice mixture over the weapon and belonging, repeating the deities' names.
- Allow the fire from the black candles to extinguish naturally.
- Bury the weapon and belonging together at a crossroads to solidify the connection.
- The weapon will now be spiritually tethered to the predestined target, making it a lethal instrument guided by murderous forces.

Potential Countermeasures and Consequences:
- A skilled practitioner of the occult may sense the tether and attempt a reversal incantation.
- The ritual may result in unforeseen consequences for the sorcerer, such as the awakening of dormant spirits or the creation of a stronger opposition.
- An improper offering, mispronounced incantation, or unclean space may anger the invoked deities, yielding undesirable outcomes for the sorcerer.

As with all potent magical rituals, the Maleficium Tethering should be enacted with caution. Mastery of murderous sorcery is required to prevent unintended effects and to ensure the efficient tethering of the lethal instrument to the designated victim.
