To accomplish this task, we must examine the individual's natal chart, which is a snapshot of the sky at the exact moment of their birth. This chart depicts the position of the planets, zodiac signs, and astrological houses, which helps us to understand their life path and karma. Let us consider a hypothetical individual for this analysis.

1. Planetary rulerships and zodiac signs across the twelve astrological houses:
Each house represents specific aspects of life, and the zodiac signs and planetary rulerships provide information about these aspects.

For our hypothetical individual, their natal chart has:
- Sun in Aries (1st house): Represents a strong sense of self, assertiveness, and leadership qualities.
- Moon in Cancer (4th house): Indicates nurturing, emotional sensitivity, and family orientation.
- Mercury in Taurus (2nd house): Suggests a practical and steady communication style and a focus on materialistic values.
- Venus in Gemini (3rd house): Implies versatile, intellectual, and playful relationships and social interactions.
- Mars in Capricorn (10th house): Shows determined pursuit of career goals, responsible actions, and structure.
- Jupiter in Libra (7th house): Reveals opportunities for relationships, balance, and harmony.
- Saturn in Aquarius (11th house): Signifies discipline in friendships and social groups, with unconventional ideals.
- Uranus in Leo (5th house): Unpredictable and innovative creative expression, sometimes rebellious.
- Neptune in Scorpio (8th house): Deeply intuitive, and a heightened sense of spiritual transformation.
- Pluto in Virgo (6th house): Indicates a powerful drive for self-improvement and meticulous analysis of daily routines.

2. Transition of planets through ruling houses:
Each planet has a unique set of attributes and lessons associated with it. As it transitions through its ruling house, it brings growth and challenges tailored to the individual.

- Saturn return (occurring every 29.5 years) - In our hypothetical individual's case, it occurs in their 11th house of social connections and friendships. This may signify a period of reevaluating friendships, taking on more social responsibility, and reassessing their long-term goals.

3. Major progressions:
Astrologers use progressions to identify significant shifts in the individual's life, focusing mainly on aspects between planets.

In our hypothetical individual's case, let's consider a progressed Sun conjunct natal Venus. This aspect represents a highly transformative period, highlighting the person's social life, relationships, and self-image. 

4. Opportunities for self-reflection, personal development, and decision-making guidance:
Through this comprehensive understanding of the individual's astrological blueprint, the following opportunities can be derived:

- Focusing on personal growth through leadership and asserting themselves given their strong Aries Sun (1st house)
- Balancing emotional sensitivity and nurturing instincts from their Cancer Moon (4th house)
- Developing practical and steady communication and value-based decision-making influenced by their Taurus Mercury (2nd house)
- Embracing versatility in relationships during the progression of Sun conjunct natal Venus
- Reassessing friendships and long-term goals during their Saturn return in Aquarius (11th house)

By examining the individual's natal chart, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of their life path and karma. Through this exploration, we have unveiled opportunities for self-reflection, personal development, and decision-making guidance in their astrological blueprint.
