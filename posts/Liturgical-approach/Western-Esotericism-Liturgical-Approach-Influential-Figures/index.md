excerpt: >
  Design an all-encompassing syllabus for a course exploring the Liturgical approach within Western esoteric traditions. The curriculum should delve into primary texts, prominent figures, and their philosophies, as well as the historical context and development of esoteric practices. Incorporate multi-disciplinary methodologies such as textual analysis, sacred geometry, and alchemical symbolism. Encourage students to engage in critical thinking and experiential learning through group discussions, comparative studies, and creative projects that re-contextualize esoteric concepts within contemporary spiritual practices. Include at least three key periods—Renaissance Hermeticism, Theosophy, and the Golden Dawn—alongside analyses of influential individuals like Agrippa, Eliphas L\xE9vi, Madame Blavatsky, and Aleister Crowley.
