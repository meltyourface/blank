To design and construct an intricate walking meditation labyrinth devoted to the exploration and understanding of Choronzon's enigmatic nature, the following elements and features will be incorporated to highlight the entity's esoteric and occult aspects:

1. **Shape and Size**: The labyrinth will take the shape of an irregular, chaotic fractal pattern, reflecting Choronzon's connection to chaos and unpredictability. The overall size of the labyrinth will be large enough to accommodate a challenging walking meditation experience, spanning approximately 333 meters in diameter to incorporate the significant numeral of 333.

2. **Pathways**: The pathways within the labyrinth will consist of a series of interconnected corridors, spirals, and dead ends, encouraging introspection and self-discovery in the process of navigating the complex layout. These pathways will be bordered by tall, imposing hedges that obscure the view of the labyrinth's entirety, further adding to the challenge of navigation and providing a feeling of disorientation and humility.

3. **Symbols and Sigils**: Choronzon's key symbols, such as the numerals 333 and sigils associated with the entity, will be etched and inscribed into the stone paths and walls of the labyrinth. These symbols will be placed strategically throughout the labyrinth, serving both as revealing guides and deceptive distractions.

4. **Altars and Ritual Points**: Throughout the labyrinth, several altars and ritual points will be strategically placed for focused rituals and contemplations. These could include a central altar with a sigil of Choronzon engraved upon it, as well as smaller peripheral altars placed at the end of long, winding paths or hidden alcoves that may serve as thresholds to access Choronzon's wisdom and insights.

5. **Hidden Messages**: Scattered throughout the labyrinth, hidden messages and cryptic riddles will be carved or written on parchment scrolls, enticing the seeker to delve deeper into the enigmatic nature of Choronzon. These messages will be placed in concealed locations, such as underneath loose stones or behind secret levers, encouraging the seeker to be observant, persistent, and determined in their quest for knowledge.

6. **Ambiance**: The labyrinth will integrate subtle elements that elicit an atmosphere of mystery, awe, and apprehension. These may include dimly lit torches that cast shadows along the paths, the scent of incense representing Choronzon's presence, and distant, ominous sounds of chanting or whispering carried by the wind.

7. **Exit and Revelation**: Upon successfully navigating the labyrinth, seekers will arrive at a final chamber that symbolizes the culmination of their journey and the revelation of Choronzon's insights. This chamber may feature a large, ornate mirror reflecting the seeker's_changed_personacircling the numeral 333, as well as a final, hidden message offering a profound understanding of Choronzon's nature.

In constructing this labyrinth, the challenge of Choronzon's tests and the potential revelation of its insights will be embodied, providing the seeker an immersive and transformative walking meditation experience.
