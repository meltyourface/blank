Banishing Ritual for Choronzon: Cleansing Lingering Energies and Protecting Living Environments

Phase 1: Initial Preparations (Days 1-3, leading up to the New Moon)
- Cleanse and purify the entire living environment thoroughly, ensuring all unwanted debris, clutter, and negative energy are removed.
- Meditate on intentions daily, focusing on the eradication of lingering energy and protection of the space in question.
- Begin collecting necessary tools, ingredients, and sacred items for the ritual.

Phase 2: Consecration and Charging (Day 4 - New Moon)
- On the eve of the New Moon, consecrate and charge all tools, ingredients, and items, invoking the power of Choronzon by using associated sigils and symbols (notably the chaos-enhancing sigil of Choronzon: a spiraling, three-armed vortex).
- Store the items in a designated sacred space until the commencement of the ritual.

Phase 3: The Ritual (Day 5 - Waxing Crescent Moon)
1. Prepare the designated ritual area by drawing a protective circle around it. Within this circle, place a central altar adorned with associated symbols and sigils of Choronzon.

2. Gather the essential tools, ingredients, and sacred items:
- Incense: Dragon's blood to align and connect with Choronzon's domain
- Crystals: Jet and black tourmaline for grounding and protection
- Chalices: A dual-sided chalice to represent the formless, chaotic nature of Choronzon
- Candles: Black and white candles to signify balance and duality; a single red candle for summoning Choronzon's energies

3. Perform the incantation, invoking Choronzon's presence:
"Choronzon of the Void, Master of Chaos and Change,
By the secret paths, I summon thee,
As I speak the ancient language, (intonate in Enochian)
Join me now, shape this plane and strengthen my domain."

4. **Engage in guided visualization techniques to deepen your connection with Choronzon**:
- Stand in the center of the circle, assume the "Chaos Star" position: legs spread, arms outstretched, head tilted back, and eyes closed.
- Visualize yourself protected and grounded within the energy of the Earth.
- Engage in rhythmic breathwork, allowing your breath to ebb and flow effortlessly, mimicking Choronzon's formlessness.
- Envision Choronzon's energies entering your living environment, sweeping away lingering energies and providing potent protection.

5. After the visualization, extinguish the red candle, symbolizing the completion of Choronzon's task, and thank the entity for its assistance.

Phase 4: Post-Ritual Grounding and Cleansing (Day 6)
- Engage in grounding techniques, such as walking barefoot outdoors or practicing deep-breathing exercises.
- Use a smudge stick or incense to perform a cleansing ritual for yourself, ensuring any residual energies are banished.

Phase 5: Maintenance and Preservation (Ongoing)
- Periodically cleanse and purify the space, incorporating elements such as natural sunlight and fresh air.
- Utilize charged crystals and sacred symbols throughout the space to maintain the cleared atmosphere.

Safety Measures:
- Work solely within the protective circle.
- Invoke the guidance and protection of benevolent guardian spirits or ancestors when necessary.
- Remain focused and confident throughout the ritual.
- Approach each step with respect and awareness of the profound powers of Choronzon and the esoteric domain.
