To begin answering this knowledge challenge, it is crucial to first understand the fundamental principles of Lucifuge Rofocale Necromancy and the Tree of Life, including the concepts of Sephiroth and Qliphoth. After establishing these foundations, we can then delve into the various ways to combine them for a deeper understanding of and connection with the spirits of the deceased.

Lucifuge Rofocale Necromancy is a form of necromancy that focuses primarily on connecting with and invoking the power of Lucifuge Rofocale, a figure from Christian demonology. Lucifuge Rofocale is often associated with the darker side of occultism and is seen as one of the gatekeepers to the infernal realm.

The Tree of Life is a key symbol in various mystical traditions, particularly in Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism. It represents the structure of the universe, the path to spiritual ascension, and the divine blueprint of creation. The tree is comprised of ten emanations, or Sephiroth, which symbolize different aspects of God and the cosmos, connected by 22 paths.

The Qliphoth, on the other hand, is often seen as the "shadow side" of the Tree of Life. It represents the unbalanced, impure, and chaotic aspects of the universe. The Qliphoth consists of ten "shells," each corresponding to one of the Sephiroth but representing its adverse qualities.

Now that we have established a foundational understanding of Lucifuge Rofocale Necromancy, the Tree of Life, and their corresponding concepts, we can explore how they can be combined to enhance a necromancer's understanding of and connection with the deceased spirits.

1. **Balancing the forces**: The Tree of Life encapsulates the idea of balancing different energies, while Lucifuge Rofocale Necromancy taps into the darker aspects of the spirit realm. By learning to strike a balance between the energies represented by the Sephiroth and Qliphoth, a necromancer can achieve a stronger and more harmonious connection with the spirits of the deceased.

2. **Understanding the complexities of existence**: Both the Tree of Life and Lucifuge Rofocale Necromancy offer insights into the complexities of existence and the different aspects of the universe. By delving deeper into these realms, a necromancer can gain a better understanding of the afterlife and the spiritual planes that spirits inhabit, allowing for more effective communication and guidance.

3. **Enhancing evocation techniques**: Through a thorough study of the Sephiroth and Qliphoth, a necromancer can augment their evocation techniques and establish a more profound connection with the spirits of the deceased. By invoking the powers of Lucifuge Rofocale and incorporating the understanding of the Sephiroth and Qliphoth, the necromancer can pierce through the veils that separate the living from the dead.

4. **Pathworking the Tree of Life**: By engaging in pathworking, wherein a practitioner meditates upon and explores the paths connecting the Sephiroth, a necromancer can strengthen their own spiritual foundation. As they progress through the various paths, they can develop a more potent connection with the spirits of the deceased, ultimately enhancing their necromantic abilities.

In conclusion, by combining the principles of Lucifuge Rofocale Necromancy with the Tree of Life and the concepts of Sephiroth and Qliphoth, a necromancer can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of existence and the afterlife. This syncretic approach enables the necromancer to strike a balance between the energies of the universe, enhance their evocation techniques, and engage in transformative pathworking, which ultimately strengthens their connection with the spirits of the deceased.
