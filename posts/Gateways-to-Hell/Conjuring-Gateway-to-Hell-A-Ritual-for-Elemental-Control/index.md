Initium Portae Inferni

Materials required:
- A circle of protection, drawn with consecrated powdered hematite
- Four elemental sigils, drawn on parchment with ink made from dragon's blood resin
- An obsidian dagger, sterilized and consecrated
- A chalice filled with sacred water
**Step 1**: Prepare the ritual space
Choose a location hidden from unwanted attention. Ensure that enough space exists to draw a circle of protection large enough for the practitioner to stand within.
**Step 2**: Draw the circle of protection
Using your consecrated powdered hematite, draw a perfect circle on the ground. This will act as the barrier between the mundane world and the otherworldly forces that you are about to summon.
**Step 3**: Place the elemental sigils
At the four cardinal directions around the circle, place the parchment with elemental sigils as follows:
- North: Earth sigil
- East: Air sigil
- South: Fire sigil
- West: Water sigil
**Step 4**: Consecrate the circle
With the obsidian dagger in hand, cut a small incision on your left palm. Allow three drops of blood to fall into the chalice filled with sacred water, then extinguish the blade within the chalice.
**Step 5**: The Elemental Invocation
Stand within the circle and chant the following invocation in a strong and clear voice:

"Ex elementis primordialis, ego invoco potentiam vestram.
Ignis, aqua, terra, et aer, venite ad me et serviatis mihi!
Abyssum aperto, portam inferni revelabo!"

(Fire, water, earth, and air, I call upon your primal power.
Descend upon me, heed my command!
Open the abyss, reveal the Gateway to Hell!)
**Step 6**: The Consecration Rite of Control
After chanting the invocation, visualize the energies of the four elements flowing through you. Once you feel the energy surround you, recite the Consecration Rite of Control:

"Ego, magister elementorum, iubeo vos stabilire portam.
In nomine inferni antiqui textus, ego consecro.
Hoc signum dominandi, ego inscribo:
Śakra-d'agzulun mordra estathinul."

(I, master of the elements, command you to stabilize the gateway.
In the name of ancient infernal texts, I consecrate thee.
With this sigil of control, I inscribe:
Śakra-d'agzulun mordra estathinul.)
**Step 7**: Imprint the Sigils of Control
As you recite the final words of the consecration rite, use the blood-soaked obsidian dagger to draw the Sigil of Control on the ground, overtop each elemental sigil:

- Śakra: Swirling vortex, representing the union of all elements
- D'agzulun: Intricate key, to bind and lock the gateway
- Mordra: Shield, providing protection and warding
- Estathinul: Serpent, intertwining the essence of the infernal realm and the material world

Upon completing the ritual, the Gateway to Hell will open, and the elemental energies will ensure its stability. The infernal forces will be bound to the Sigils of Control, allowing you to maintain authority over the portal.

Remember to respect the realm that you have entered and ensure to always use your powers and command over the portal responsibly. The consequences of reckless action may attract undesired attention from ancient and malevolent beings.
