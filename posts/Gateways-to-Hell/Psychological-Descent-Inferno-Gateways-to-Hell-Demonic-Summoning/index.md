To provide a comprehensive response to the knowledge challenge, we first need to understand the three main components presented: Dante Alighieri's "Inferno," real-life geographical locations associated with alleged "Gateways to Hell," and the Lesser Key of Solomon. Then, we'll explore their historical and symbolic connections to illustrate how they represent humanity's psychological descent into darkness and self-destructive behaviors leading to spiritual enlightenment.

1. **Dante Alighieri's "Inferno"**:
Dante Alighieri's "Inferno" is the first part of his magnum opus, "The Divine Comedy," written in the early 14th century. In it, the protagonist Dante, guided by the Roman poet Virgil, journeys through the nine circles of Hell, each representing a progressively worse sin and its corresponding punishment. The circles are Limbo, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Heresy, Violence, Fraud, and Treachery. 

2. **Real-life geographical locations associated with alleged "Gateways to Hell"**:
Several locations around the world are purported to be "Gateways to Hell" based on local folklore, geological features, or historical events. Examples include Houska Castle (Czech Republic), Stull Cemetery (Kansas, USA), and the Cave of Seven Sleepers (Turkey). Often, these locations are associated with paranormal activity or evil entities, adding to their fearsome reputations.

3. **The Lesser Key of Solomon**:
"The Lesser Key of Solomon" is a grimoire (a book of magical knowledge) dating back to the 17th century, primarily focusing on demonic summoning and the control of spirits. **It is divided into five books**: Ars Goetia, Ars Theurgia Goetia, Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel, and Ars Notoria. The most well-known part, Ars Goetia, contains descriptions of seventy-two demons, many with connections to biblical and mythological figures.

Now, let's explore the historical and symbolic connections between these three components.

A. **Dante's Inferno and Real-life Gateways to Hell**:

In Dante's Inferno, Hell is portrayed as an underground realm with a gradually tightening spiral pathway through its nine circles. This configuration may have been influenced by, or might have influenced, the idea and legends surrounding real-life Gateways to Hell. Geographical locations that seem to possess features resembling Dante's Hell, such as caves, underground chambers, or ominous landscapes, have often been imbued with spiritual significance (positive or negative) throughout human history.

B. **Dante's Inferno and the Lesser Key of Solomon**:

The Inferno presents a hierarchical organization of sins and punishments, reflecting the morality of Medieval Christianity. Likewise, the Lesser Key of Solomon organizes the demonic hierarchy in a meticulous order, assigning them specific qualities, ranks, and even subservient hordes. This orderliness in both works suggests that they share the idea that even the chaotic and dark aspects of human existence can be classified and comprehended rationally.

C. **Real-life Gateways to Hell and the Lesser Key of Solomon**:

Locations associated with Gateways to Hell often involve stories of demonic presence or influence, which correlates with the focus of the Lesser Key of Solomon. This grimoire, by providing a system for summoning and controlling spirits, offers a potential link between these locations and the forces believed to reside within them.

These connections represent an intricate understanding of humanity's psychological descent into darkness and self-destructive behaviors. Dante's Inferno exposes the various sins and failings that can lead individuals astray, with the journey through Hell itself mirroring the psychological and spiritual descent one might undergo when engaging in sinful actions. Real-life Gateways to Hell, on the other hand, externalize this concept, serving as a reminder of the darker elements lurking in the world and within ourselves. The Lesser Key of Solomon also explores themes of power, knowledge, and control, revealing the ever-present human temptation to manipulate the unseen forces of the universe, which may bring about self-destruction.

Ultimately, however, these works also offer a path to spiritual enlightenment. Dante's journey, for instance, continues through Purgatory and Paradise, representing the human potential for redemption and ascension. Similarly, the Lesser Key of Solomon suggests that, while interacting with the demonic forces can be dangerous, acquiring knowledge and mastery of them might grant an individual a deeper understanding of the cosmos and oneself.

In summary, Dante Alighieri's Inferno, real-life Gateways to Hell, and the Lesser Key of Solomon are interconnected through historical and symbolic connections rooted in the exploration of the darker aspects of human nature, order within chaos, and moral failings. By observing and understanding these concepts, one can potentially use this knowledge to achieve heightened self-awareness and spiritual enlightenment.
