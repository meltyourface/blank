In order to analyze the impact that Apollonius of Tyana's core philosophy and chosen spiritual practices had on the development of Neoplatonism and early occultism, we must first understand who Apollonius was and the basics of his teachings. Apollonius of Tyana was a 1st-century AD philosopher and mystic who gained a reputation for his supernatural abilities and extensive knowledge of the esoteric. His teachings were influenced by the Greek philosophical school of the Pythagoreans and Eastern mystery religions.

Now, let's delve into the key aspects of his philosophy, spiritual practices, and the development of Neoplatonism and early occultism.

Core Philosophy:

The key tenets of Apollonius' philosophy revolve around the concepts of virtue, asceticism, and the search for divine wisdom. He believed that a virtuous life is the means by which humans can attain a higher state of being and come closer to the divine. Ascetic practices, such as vegetarianism, celibacy, and meditation, were essential tools for achieving this lofty goal.

Influence on Neoplatonism:

Neoplatonism emerged around 200 years after Apollonius' time as a resurgence and reinterpretation of Plato's teachings. Neoplatonism posits that there is a hierarchy of being, with the One (or the Good) at the top, followed by the Intellect (or Nous) representing the realm of Platonic Forms, and finally, the Material World where humans reside.

Although Apollonius was not a direct initiator of Neoplatonism, his teachings shared a connection with the budding movement. Apollonius' emphasis on asceticism and the pursuit of divine wisdom undoubtedly influenced the Neoplatonist approach to achieving a closer connection to the One. Neoplatonists regarded ascetic practices as a means to purify and elevate the soul, aligning with Apollonius' teachings.

Furthermore, Apollonius contributed significantly to the notion of theurgy, which became a central element in Neoplatonism. Theurgy, the practice of spiritual rituals intended to invoke divine powers, appeared congruous with Apollonius’ reputed supernatural abilities and aligned with his spiritual practices.

Influence on Early Occultism:

By the time Apollonius lived, belief in magic and the supernatural was already widespread in the Hellenistic world. As his teachings disseminated, they contributed to the expanding repertoire of magical and occult knowledge across the Greco-Roman world. Apollonius' reputed supernatural abilities—as a healer, clairvoyant, and miracle-worker—further established his influence on early occultism.

Apollonius' syncretic worldview, which drew on Greek philosophy, Eastern mysticism, and Gnostic beliefs, created a fertile ground for the development of Hermeticism, a spiritual tradition closely linked to early occultism. Key themes in Hermeticism, such as the pursuit of wisdom and the notion that humans can transcend their material existence, can be traced back to Apollonius' teachings.

Cross-Cultural Influences:

Apollonius was deeply influenced by Greek philosophical traditions (particularly Pythagoreanism and Platonism) and Eastern religious practices from Persia, India, and Egypt. His teachings often presented aspects of Greek and Eastern spirituality, which appealed to a diverse audience in the highly multicultural Hellenistic period.

In particular, his emphasis on asceticism, the quest for spiritual wisdom, and his reputed supernatural abilities resonate with various Eastern religious traditions. Apollonius' syncretic approach created a kind of spiritual cross-pollination, facilitating the spread of ideas and practices across cultures and possibly setting the foundations for later developments in Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and Hermeticism.

To summarize, Apollonius of Tyana's core philosophy and spiritual practices had a profound impact on the development of Neoplatonism and early occultism. His ideas, which drew from a range of cross-cultural sources, provided a basis for both Neoplatonist philosophy and Hermeticism. Furthermore, his reputed supernatural abilities and the practice of ascetic disciplines contributed to the ever-evolving world of occultism as it sought to understand and harness the hidden forces of the cosmos.
