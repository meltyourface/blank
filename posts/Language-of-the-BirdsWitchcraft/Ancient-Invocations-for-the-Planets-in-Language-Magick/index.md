## I. Invocation of the Moon – Monday

Lunar sway, Diana's might,
Silver whispers fill the night,
Tides that ebb and sometimes flow,
Guide my art in twilight's glow.

As trilled owls through the branches soar,
Their hidden tongues the secrets bore,
In lunar light, a truth revealed,
The Language born, its power sealed.

Cycles of growth and wane above,
In my craft, I call thy love,
Powers of water and dreams profound,
Lend me wisdom, let insight resound.

### II. Invocation of Mars – Tuesday

Mars aflame, the warrior's pride,
Red-tinged spark, the heavens wide,
In iron grasp, protect my stand,
Please guide my will with martial hand.

An Eagle crowned, the Language soars,
The battle won through whispered roars,
In strength I speak, the courage untold,
Mysterious words in ancient mold.

By crimson flame and sword's swift thrust,
In divine ire, I place my trust,
Warrior's might, the fearless mind,
To conjure change, the path to find.


### III. Invocation of Mercury – Wednesday

Hermes fleet, in swift traverse,
Thy elusive grace, my mind immerse,
Words that dance and twist in air,
Grant Your gift, my wit declare.

Language of Birds, in feather's guise,
A clever tongue, to hide, disguise,
Thus, scribe of gods, I seek your aid,
To strengthen bonds that words have laid.

Wisely, keenly, may I see,
Intricacies that murmur free,
In silvered steps, the path unveil,
Riddles' keys for truth to hale.


### IV. Invocation of Jupiter – Thursday

Zeus almighty, thunder's roar,
Guide my way to wisdom's door,
Royal mantle, lofty mind,
By Your hand, let fate unwind.

Iambic cries dance through the trees,
In Birds' sweet tune, reigned harmonies,
With sovereign power, my voice resounds,
Jupiter's grace, my will surrounds.

Expand my reach, bestow success,
In regal counsel, let me bless,
Lead me to the treasure's core,
In light of splendor, forevermore.


### V. Invocation of Venus – Friday

Venus, queen of love's delight,
Enchant my art with softest light,
Adorn with grace each whispered word,
Seen, unheard, in beauty stirred.

Hearten whispers, the Birds each sing,
In magic, truth, adornments bring,
Through evening's splendor, passion's glean,
True wisdom lies beneath the sheen.

Entwined are hearts, entwined are tongues,
Our secrets bound in lover's songs,
I call on thee, beguile Divine,
To weave my words and fortune shine.


### VI. Invocation of Saturn – Saturday

Saturn's reign, time's slow embrace,
In wisdom's march, my mind encase,
To tame the chaos, bind and free,
Let my voice Your power decree.

As hooded crows, in omens seen,
The Language carves a space between,
In cosmic tether, create and break,
Saturn's path, I undertake.

Rewards await the patient heart,
In shadow long, a brilliant start,
With master's hand, in whispered word,
I summon now the truths once heard.


### VII. Invocation of the Sun – Sunday

Sol Invictus, radiant King,
Empower my voice, let Your light spring,
In golden beams, with life imbue,
My chant of fire and purpose true.

Phoenix arise, the Birds released,
Resplendent Language in the East,
The solar fire in my heart,
To create anew, to make a start.

In tides of fortune, joyful might,
Courage and glory, my birthright,
An emblem bright, my power burn,
The path of mastery, I discern.
