## Astral Traveler's Soothing Salve

Ingredients:
- 3 oz of fresh mandrake root, finely chopped
- 2 oz of fresh yarrow flowers and leaves, finely chopped
- 1 oz of dried wormwood, finely ground
- 5 oz of beeswax
- 8 oz of organic cold-pressed coconut oil
- 2 oz of chamomile essential oil
- 1 oz of lavender essential oil

Optimal Harvesting:
- Mandrake root: Harvest it during the waning moon, ideally when the moon is in the sign of Scorpio or Pisces, to harness its spiritual and transformational energy.
- Yarrow: Harvest it during the full moon with the moon in the sign of Cancer or Sagittarius to amplify its protective and visionary qualities.
- Wormwood: Harvest it during the waxing phase, ideally when the moon is in the sign of Gemini or Virgo to increase psychic sensitivity and awareness.

Instructions:

1. Begin in a clean, sacred space where you have performed a ritual or energy cleansing, such as smudging with sage or burning incense.

2. ****Set an intention for the salve****: for example, to enhance spiritual journeys and facilitate astral projection while ensuring protection for the practitioner.

3. Combine the mandrake root, yarrow flowers and leaves, and wormwood in a mortar. Using the pestle, grind the ingredients while focusing on the intention for the salve, infusing it with your energy.

4. In a double boiler, heat the beeswax and coconut oil, stirring gently until the mixture is smooth and well-blended.

5. Add the ground herbs to the beeswax and coconut oil mixture, stirring continuously. Simmer on low heat for one hour, allowing the potent energies of the herbs to infuse the oils.

6. Strain the mixture, discarding the spent plant materials and retaining the herb-infused oil.

7. Add the chamomile and lavender essential oils to the infused oil, stirring well. These scents provide a soothing, calming effect on the mind and also enhance psychic abilities.

8. Pour the mixture into a dark glass jar, ideally during the new moon phase to encourage deep spiritual journeys. Seal the jar with a lid and allow the salve to cool and solidify.

9. Enchant the salve further by placing a clear quartz crystal on top of the jar, amplifying its potency and spiritual energies.

Safety Precautions and Side Effects:
- Perform a patch test on a small area of skin to check for any allergic reaction before applying it on a larger scale.
- Avoid using the salve on broken or irritated skin.
- Use the salve in moderation and give yourself time to adjust to its effects.
- Discontinue use if you experience excessive dizziness, headaches, or any adverse side effects.
- Keep the salve out of reach from children and pets.

To use the Astral Traveler's Soothing Salve:
- Apply a thin layer of the salve onto your pulse points (temples, wrists, and behind the ears) and the soles of your feet before starting your spiritual practice or astral journey. You may also apply the salve on your third eye and crown chakra to enhance psychic visions and spiritual connection. Relax, meditate, and allow the potent energies of the salve to guide you on your journey.
