In order to establish connections between esoteric symbols associated with Superpowers in various cultural systems, we will delve into ancient Egyptian, Norse, and Aztec mythologies to study each symbol's meaning, usage, and their relation to the manifestation or amplification of Superpowers.

Ancient Egyptian Symbols and Superpowers:

1. The Eye of Horus: This ancient Egyptian symbol represents protection, royal power, and good health. It is believed to grant its possessor extraordinary healing and protective powers. 
2. The Ankh: Often called the "key of life," the Ankh symbolizes eternal life, and is associated with the idea of resurrection and divine wisdom, which could translate to supernatural abilities like immortality and a deep understanding of cosmic knowledge.

Norse Symbols and Superpowers:

1. The Valknut: This symbol, often connected with the god Odin, represents the power of life and death, and could be interpreted as a conduit for supernatural control over life forces.
2. The Helm of Awe: A symbol of protection, it can be used to instill great fear in enemies and could be harnessed as a form of telepathic power or a way to amplify the mental strength of its possessor.

Aztec Symbols and Superpowers:

1. The Ollin: A symbol of movement and transformation, the Ollin represents the ability to change and adapt, possibly granting the possessor shapeshifting or transformation powers.
2. The Nahui Ollin: Representing the five suns of the Aztec cosmology, this symbol is tied to the idea of recreating the world or resetting the balance of nature, leading to powers relating to elemental control and creation.

Hypothetical Scenarios of Interaction and Conflict:

1. A battle between an individual wielding the Eye of Horus from ancient Egyptian mythology and another using the Helm of Awe from Norse mythology could involve a struggle between the forces of divine protection and warrior-like fear, with each participant aiming to break through each otherâ€™s defenses.
2. A collaboration between someone possessing the Ankh and another with the Nahui Ollin could result in the joining of forces to maintain balance and harmony in the world, utilizing their powers of eternal life, divine wisdom, and elemental creation to reshape and heal the world.
3. A potential conflict between the users of the Ollin from Aztec mythology and the Valknut from Norse mythology could emerge from a clash of ideals around transformation and life forces, with the shape-shifting Ollin fighter attempting to utilize transformative abilities to infiltrate and disrupt the order maintained by the life-and-death weaver of the Valknut.

The complexities of these esoteric symbols and their connections to Superpowers within their respective cultural systems show how deeply rooted and varied the concepts of extraordinary abilities are in human history. By investigating the meanings, usage, and implications of these symbols, we can gain a better understanding of how ancient cultures viewed and potentially wielded Superpowers, as well as how they might have interacted or conflicted with one another in hypothetical scenarios.
