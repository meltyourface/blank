Within the illuminated manuscripts of medieval European medicine lies a rich and fascinating amalgamation of esoteric symbolism, influenced by the layered wisdom of alchemical, hermetic, and mystical teachings. At the very core of these labyrinthine scrolls lies the intricate interconnections of the four humors, comprising Sanguine, Choleric, Melancholic, and Phlegmatic natures. 

The humoral theory posits that the balance and imbalance of these vital fluids, each related to fundamental elements and cosmic forces, are pivotal to the state of human health and temperament. To fully grasp the layered meaning and symbolism within these sacred texts, one must delve into the multi-faceted tapestry of the humors and their allegorical significance.

Sanguine, associated with blood and the element of air, is symbolized by the eagle in the manuscript's margins. It represents the optimistic, passionate, and social nature within the cosmic domain. As a manifestation of the active and growth-oriented aspect of life, the Sanguine temperament evokes the symbolic association with the planetary influences of Jupiter—growth, expansion, and abundance.

Choleric, linked to yellow bile and the element of fire, finds its esoteric symbol in the lion, emblematic of courage, leadership, and force. Hermetic philosophy holds the fiery nature of the Choleric temperament as the embodiment of transformative energies. Its connection to the planet Mars—energy, assertiveness, and strife—reveals a relationship to the alchemical principle of Calcination, the purging of impurities through fire.

Melancholic, stemming from black bile and the element of earth, is allegorically depicted by the bull, representing endurance, stability, and introspection. The stoic nature of the Melancholic temperament is related to the planet Saturn—constraints, discipline, and introspection. Its role in the cosmic scheme highlights the need for balance and grounding, exemplified by the alchemical process of Coagulation, the materialization and solidification of spiritual insights into tangible form.

Phlegmatic, represented by phlegm and the element of water, is symbolized by the ethereal swan. Its traits of adaptability, sensitivity, and calm, find a parallel in the planetary influence of the Moon—emotion, intuition, and responsiveness. The transformative power of the Phlegmatic humor is observed in the alchemical stage of Dissolution, the purification of separating and distilling base matter into its pure essence.

The interrelationships between the humors can be extrapolated not only within the context of physical health but also in a cosmological and spiritual sense. These allegorical associations highlight the need for balance and harmony between all aspects of life, from our physical composition to the underlying forces that govern existence. It is through understanding the complex web of the humoral doctrine and the esoteric symbolism that surrounds it that one may begin to grasp the hidden wisdom embedded within those mystical medieval manuscripts.
