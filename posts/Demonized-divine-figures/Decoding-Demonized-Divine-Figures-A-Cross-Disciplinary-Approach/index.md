To construct a comprehensive, multi-step interpretative method or system for uncovering and analyzing the veiled symbolism, esoteric messages, and obscured allegories present within the myths, legends, and folklore surrounding Demonized divine figures, we need to carry out the following steps:
**Step 1**: Thorough Research and Compilation
Begin by conducting an extensive research and gathering primary resources, such as occult writings (the Lesser Key of Solomon, the Goetia), religious texts (the Bible, the Quran, the Book of Enoch), and philosophical texts (works by Plato, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell). Also, collect secondary literature on comparative mythology, cultural anthropology, and the psychological interpretations of these figures (such as in the works of Jung and his "Collective Unconscious" theory). 
**Step 2**: Deconstructing Myths and Legends
Break down the gathered myths and legends into their core components or narrative structures, stripping away the surface level plot elements to uncover the underlying patterns. You may use the "monomyth" or "Hero's Journey" framework pioneered by Joseph Campbell or the archetypal analysis of Jungian psychology.
**Step 3**: Identifying Symbolism and Themes
Examine the core components and symbols within the myths (e.g., serpents, inverted pentagrams, dark colors) and connect these back to their cultural, religious, or historical origins. Note recurring motifs, such as the motif of the "fall from grace," present in stories of the Fallen Angels, Lilith or Baphomet. Explore the sociocultural backdrop that influenced the emergence of these symbols and themes.
**Step 4**: Comparative Analysis
Perform a cross-cultural analysis of the myths and legends surrounding Demonized divine figures, comparing them to similar myths and stories in other traditions. Analyze the similarities and differences between these figures and explore their shared roots or influences. Utilize the insights from comparative mythology to find hidden meanings and cultural exchanges.
**Step 5**: Psychological Interpretation
Incorporate principles of Jungian psychology, such as the concept of the "Shadow" and archetypes to analyze the psychological significance of the Demonized divine figures. Examine how these figures could represent repressed or taboo aspects of consciousness and how they manifest in our psyche as symbols and archetypes.
**Step 6**: Historical Context
Analyze the evolution of Demonized divine figures through history, from their origins to their modern reinterpretations, considering how sociopolitical factors, cultural changes, and historical events have shaped the perception and development of these figures.
**Step 7**: Synthesis and Insights
Integrate the findings from the previous steps into a cohesive interpretative framework that provides a deep and nuanced understanding of the meaning and significance of Demonized divine figures. Draw connections between the psychological, historical, and cultural aspects of these figures to reveal patterns and insights into their symbolism and allegories.

By following these steps, we can produce a richly layered and innovative framework for dissecting myths and legends surrounding Demonized divine figures and uncovering the hidden layers of meaning within their stories and symbolism. This comprehensive method will combine elements of occult studies, religious texts, philosophy, and psychology to provide a wide-ranging analysis of these enigmatic figures from various perspectives, revealing the complex web of meanings and associations that inform and shape their myths and legends.
