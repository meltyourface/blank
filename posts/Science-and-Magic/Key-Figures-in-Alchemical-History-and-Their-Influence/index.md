1. Thoth: Thoth is an ancient Egyptian god of wisdom, writing, and alchemy associated with the Emerald Tablet. He is believed to have been a great alchemist who wrote several important texts. His integration of spiritual concepts and magical practices in alchemy heavily influenced the Hermetic tradition.

2. Hermes Trismegistus: Sometimes identified as a syncretism of Thoth, Hermes Trismegistus is considered the founder of Hermeticism. His supposed works include the Corpus Hermeticum and the Emerald Tablet, which introduced the concept of "As above, so below," a major tenet in alchemy.

3. Zosimos of Panopolis: A Greek alchemist from the 3rd-4th century, Zosimos documented the principles of using allegory and symbolism in alchemical texts. He contributed important theoretical and practical advancements, paving the way for the complex relationship between alchemy, religion, and philosophy.

4. Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber): An 8th-century Persian alchemist, Jabir established experimental methods and pioneered the field of chemical investigation. He developed the theory of the four elements and conducted experiments in mineralogy, leading to the discovery of many essential acids and compounds.

5. Avicenna (Ibn Sina): A renowned Persian polymath, Avicenna contributed to alchemy's intellectual foundation in the Islamic Golden Age. Integrating Islamic theology and Aristotelian philosophy within his alchemical framework, he explored essential ideas about the structure of the cosmos, prefiguring modern chemistry.

6. Albertus Magnus: A 13th-century German philosopher and alchemist, Albertus Magnus conducted extensive research on minerals and alchemical processes. He is often credited with the discovery of arsenic and the first systematic exploration of the philosopher's stone concept, blending Christian theology with alchemical practices.

7. Ramon Llull: A 13th-century Spanish alchemist, Llull developed intricate systems of logic and symbolism to create a unified method for understanding both science and spirituality. He played a critical role in European alchemy by disseminating the concept of the philosopher's stone throughout Latin Christendom.

8. Nicholas Flamel: A 14th-century French scribe and alchemist reputed to have successfully created the philosopher's stone. While the historical evidence for his achievements is scant, Flamel has left a lasting impact on alchemical lore and is often mentioned in alchemy-related works of fiction.

9. Paracelsus: A 16th-century Swiss-German alchemist and physician, Paracelsus revolutionized the use of minerals and chemicals in medicine. His holistic approach, which saw connections between alchemy, medicine, and spirituality, ultimately inspired future developments in chemistry and modern pharmacology.

10. Sir Isaac Newton: Although primarily known for his groundbreaking work in physics and mathematics, Newton was a devoted alchemist. His alchemical texts and experiments demonstrate a unique understanding of matter and its principles. His theories on gravity, motion, and the nature of light had a profound impact on the evolution of modern scientific thought and contributed to the separation of alchemy and chemistry.

These ten alchemists have shaped the evolution of both science and magic, leaving a lasting legacy in the fields of chemistry, medicine, and philosophy. By blending natural philosophy with mystical and spiritual elements, they have contributed to the development of modern scientific thought and magical practices. Contemporary practitioners continue to look to these intellectual giants for inspiration and guidance.
