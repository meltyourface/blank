The Essence of "As Above, So Below"

The phrase "As above, so below" finds its origin in the Emerald Tablet, a foundation text in the hermetic and alchemical tradition, attributed to the syncretic deity Hermes Trismegistus. This phrase is considered to encapsulate the hermetic principle of Correspondence, one of the foundational axioms that underpin much of esoteric knowledge. 

To understand this phrase's significance, we need to delve into the concept of hermeticism, its implications in alchemy and quantum physics, as well as how both disciplines interrelate concerning energy manipulation and manifestation practices.

Hermeticism and its Principles

Hermeticism is an ancient philosophical and spiritual tradition that emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge, divine wisdom, and personal transformation. It's a syncretic belief system drawing from several practices such as Egyptian, Greek, and Roman philosophies. The seven Hermetic Principles are:

1. Mentalism: The Universe is a mental construct, and reality is shaped by consciousness.
2. Correspondence: "As above, so below" reflects the connections and relationships between different levels of existence.
3. Vibration: Everything is in constant motion and oscillation.
4. Polarity: Dualities exist everywhere, with one extreme balancing the other.
5. Rhythm: There's a steady flow and pattern in events, governed by cycles.
6. Cause and Effect: The Law of Karma, suggesting every action has consequences.
7. Gender: The principle of duality extends to masculine and feminine energies, present in all things.

Alchemy and Quantum Physics

Alchemical Transmutation

Alchemy is a predecessor to chemistry, rooted in the pursuit of turning base metals into gold, known as the Magnum Opus or Great Work. Beyond material transformations, alchemists also sought spiritual transformation and enlightenment. The phrase "As above, so below" in alchemy implies that processes taking place on the macrocosmic level also occur on a microcosmic level, thereby mirroring the cosmic relationship between the known universe and the atomic world. 

One of the essential ideas in alchemy is that every substance is composed of different proportions of four basic elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These elements can be transmuted or transformed through the control and manipulation of "ether" or the prima materia, which is considered to be the source and substrate of all elements.

Quantum Physics

Quantum physics is a branch of modern physics that deals with the behavior of atomic and subatomic particles. It diverges from conventional (Newtonian) physics by introducing the concept of wave-particle duality and the observer effect. Concepts such as quantum entanglement, superposition, and nonlocality provide insight into the interconnectedness of matter and energy across vast distances.

The significance of "As above, so below" within quantum physics suggests that the Universe's fundamental principles operate on the microcosmic level (subatomic particles) and the macrocosmic level (celestial bodies and galaxies). In this regard, hermetic principles such as correspondence and vibration resonate with scientific findings in quantum mechanics. Thus, the phrase bridges a connection between the esoteric realm and modern physics.

Interrelation and Implications

The interrelation between alchemical transmutation and quantum physics can be viewed through the lens of the effect of consciousness on our understanding of the Universe. Alchemy, which works with ether, and quantum physics, with its focus on fields and particles, suggests that the observer's consciousness may have a profound effect on outcomes and manifestations.

Energy Manipulation and Manifestation Practices

Modern energy manipulation practices, such as Reiki healing and psychic abilities, can be understood better through the lens of "As above, so below." With the hermetic principle of Correspondence as a foundation, one can consider the impact of mind and intention in influencing both alchemical transmutations and quantum phenomena.

As humanity's understanding of quantum physics expands, we are more capable of exploring the potential connections between matter, energy, and consciousness. Such exploration not only grants deeper insight into the nature of reality but also helps to identify practical applications for energy manipulation and manifestation practices.

In summary, the Emerald Tablet's phrase "As above, so below" represents a crucial concept within the vast fields of alchemy, hermeticism, and quantum physics. This phrase embodies the interconnectedness and interrelationship between various levels of existence, suggesting that principles governing one domain echo throughout other domains. Consequently, this axiom offers a profound framework for understanding and potentially influencing the workings of the Universe, with implications for energy manipulation and manifestation practices in modern times.
