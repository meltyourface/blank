In the esoteric tradition of Sidereal FeastVodou, we find a plethora of ancient rituals that call upon the guidance and protection of Vodou spirits known as Lwa. **For this particular ritual, we shall focus on invoking the energies of three powerful Lwa**: Damballa, Erzulie Freda, and Ogoun. We will incorporate three traditional herbs, two consecrated oils, and a triad of colors to enhance our connection to these spirits.

Herbs:
1. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) - Associated with love, protection, and wealth.
2. Vervain (Verbena officinalis) - Linked with purification, spiritual cleansing, and protection.
3. Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - Utilized for divination, psychic abilities, and prophetic dreams.

Oils:
1. Vetiver oil (Vetiveria zizanioides) - A grounding, protective, and purifying oil.
2. Ylang Ylang oil (Cananga odorata) - An oil known for attracting love, sensuality, and spiritual communion.

Colors:
1. White - Representing purity, light, and Damballa.
2. Pink - Symbolic of love, compassion, and Erzulie Freda.
3. Red - Embodying power, strength, and Ogoun.

The ritual:

1. Begin by creating a sacred space. Cleanse the area by smudging with sage or palo santo to drive away negative or residual energies. 

2. Set up an altar with items associated with the three Lwa. Place a white cloth over the altar, and on it arrange offerings such as food and drink, statuettes, or other symbols relevant to each spirit. Also set aside a small bowl for each herb.

3. Light three candles, one white, one pink, and one red; as you do so, invoke the energies of Damballa, Erzulie Freda, and Ogoun by reciting their respective prayers or songs.

4. Place a few drops of vetiver oil in each bowl containing the herbs and mix well. Anoint your forehead and temples with ylang ylang oil, allowing its fragrance to open the senses to ethereal communication.

5. Sit quietly in front of the altar and meditate on your intentions for the ritual. Formulate a direct but heartfelt request for guidance, protection, or assistance from the Lwa.

6. Light a charcoal briquette (or similar safe burning method) and, one by one, add a pinch of each herb-oil mixture. As the fragrant smoke rises, visualize your intentions being carried to the spirits and trust that they will be received with a willing, empathetic ear.

7. Once the herbs have burned, express your gratitude and reverence for the wisdom and protection of these ancient Vodou spirits. Extinguish the candles, close your ritual space, and give thanks for the opportunity to connect with this powerful spiritual legacy.

It is important to approach this ritual with humility, respect, and a genuine desire for spiritual growth. By honoring the Lwa and embracing the sacred teachings of Sidereal FeastVodou, you will enrich your practice and deepen your connection to the realm of the unseen.
