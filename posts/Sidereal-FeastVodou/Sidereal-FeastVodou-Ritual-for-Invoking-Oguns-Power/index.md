## Title: Sidereal FeastVodou Ceremony in Honor of Ogun

**Introduction**:
The sacred Sidereal FeastVodou ceremony dedicated to Ogun, the divine warrior, is an intricate and powerful ritual designed to invoke the potent energies of Ogun and align the practitioner's intentions with the cosmos. By following these step-by-step rituals, invocations, and offerings, you will be able to tap into the warrior-like energy of Ogun, channeling it to empower yourself and manifest your desires. Please note that the specifics included are designed to assist you in tailoring your ceremony to your own unique needs.
**Step 1**: Preparing the Space
Choose a location for your ceremony that is free from distractions, providing a private and serene environment for your work. Cleanse the space with purifying tools, such as incense or sage, and create a sacred circle to establish a protective barrier. Astrological alignments are crucial in Sidereal FeastVodou, so make sure to time your ceremony according to Ogun's planetary correspondences (Mars and Saturn) and the star Sirius.
**Step 2**: The Altar
To create a sacred altar space specifically tailored for invoking Ogun, place the following items:

1. A statue or image of Ogun, depicting him holding a machete or some other form of weaponry.
2. A tinplate with nine holes, representing Ogun's iron shield.
3. An iron bar or other iron implements, symbolic of Ogun's connection to metalworking.
4. A small anvil and hammer, representing his skilled craftsmanship.
5. Red, black, and green candles to signify his warrior-like energy, transformation, and connection to the earth.
6. A dish of spiced rum or palm wine as an offering.
7. Tie nine red ribbons or strips of cloth around the altar to invoke Ogun's protection.
**Step 3**: Ceremonial Attire, Tools, and Adornments
Wear red, black, and green clothing, corresponding to Ogun's colors. Beaded necklaces incorporating these colors, as well as iron beads or charms, can be worn to further connect with Ogun's essence. Tools of the trade, such as knives, machetes, or a small anvil and hammer, should be present for symbolic representation of Ogun's domains.
**Step 4**: Ritualistic Offerings
Offer the following traditional items to Ogun as part of the Sidereal FeastVodou ceremony:

1. Spiced rum or palm wine, poured over the iron implements and anvil.
2. Red beans and rice, as a staple food offering.
3. Roasted meat and peppers, symbolic of the warrior's fiery energy.
**Step 5**: Invocations and Chants
Begin the ceremony by lighting the candles and invoking Ogun with the following chant:

"Ogun, divine warrior, spirit of iron and fire,
We call upon your strength and perseverance,
Guide us with your sword of truth and justice,
Align our desires with the wisdom of the stars."

Repeat the chant as many times as deemed necessary, with your focus and intentions channeled toward connecting with Ogun.

**Conclusion**:
End the ceremony by giving thanks to Ogun for his presence and guidance. Extinguish the candles and carefully dispose of the offerings. Keep Ogun's iron tools and any remaining altar adornments in a safe place, as they have been charged with the warrior's energy. Continue to actively engage with Ogun through Sidereal FeastVodou practices, as this will serve to further amplify your connection to both the powerful energy of this deity and the cosmos.
