To answer this intriguing knowledge challenge, let's first break down the key concepts mentioned, namely lunar maria, highland regions, prominent craters, alchemy, sacred geometry, and ancient esoteric wisdom. By understanding these terms and their individual connections, we can weave together an overarching narrative that demonstrates how they interact and symbolize the principles of alchemy, sacred geometry, and ancient esoteric wisdom in ways that are relevant to the transformative process of an initiate.

Lunar maria are large, dark, basaltic plains on the Moon, formed by volcanic eruptions. The highland regions refer to the more elevated, heavily cratered, and whiter parts of the Moon's surface. Prominent craters are the most distinguishable impact features on the Moon that have attracted the attention and curiosity of humankind throughout the ages.

Alchemy is a philosophical and early proto-scientific tradition that combines elements of chemistry, metallurgy, physics, medicine, astrology, and mysticism. Sacred geometry involves the study of the geometric shapes and patterns that are found in nature, architecture, art, and esoterica. Ancient esoteric wisdom covers a vast array of secret philosophical teachings and spiritual practices apart from mainstream religious and scientific beliefs.

Lunar Maria and the Principles of Alchemy:
The lunar maria can be symbolically linked to the alchemical process of nigredo, or blackening, a crucial stage in the transformation of base metal into gold. This stage represents the subject being purified and cleansed to expose its true essence. In the same manner, the volcanic eruptions that formed the lunar maria exposed the basaltic plains, revealing their dark, underlying essence.

Highland Regions and Sacred Geometry:
The highland regions of the Moon demonstrate the significance of harmony and balance in nature. These elevated and cratered terrains maintain a delicate equilibrium through their juxtaposition with the smoother and darker maria. This harmony is reminiscent of the golden ratio, a key concept in sacred geometry that represents ideal proportion and balance, which can permeate the initiate's personal transformation as they strive for equilibrium and harmony in their own journey.

Prominent Craters and Ancient Esoteric Wisdom:
Prominent craters on the Moon can be seen as metaphors for initiates as they represent the trials and tribulations they must undergo to reach spiritual enlightenment. Each crater signifies an obstacle or a lesson that initiates need to overcome or embrace to progress. Furthermore, the Moon's cycle of waxing and waning echoes the cyclical nature of spiritual growth and serves as an example of the ancient philosophical doctrine of "As above, so below," a key tenet of Hermeticism.

Interaction and Deeper Correlations:
As a master in the esoteric realm, I propose that the lunar maria, highland regions, and prominent craters interact and symbolize the principles of alchemy, sacred geometry, and ancient esoteric wisdom through their shared portrayal of transformation and pursuit of harmony. The lunar landscape mirrors the transformative journey of an initiate, with each element imbued with symbolic significance that makes the Moon an extraordinary representation of the alchemical, geometrical, and esoteric principles.

In summary, the lunar maria exemplify the alchemical process of purification and introspection, the highland regions embody harmony and balance as found in sacred geometry, and the prominent craters symbolize obstacles and spiritual milestones for initiates. The interactions between these elements reveal deeper correlations that are applicable to the transformative process of an initiate and serve as an interwoven representation of alchemy, sacred geometry, and ancient esoteric wisdom.
