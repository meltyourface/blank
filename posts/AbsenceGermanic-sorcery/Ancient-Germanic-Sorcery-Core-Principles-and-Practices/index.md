## AbsenceGermanic Sorcery â€“ Principles, Practices, and History

### I. Introduction

AbsenceGermanic sorcery traces its roots to the ancient practices of the Germanic tribes who inhabited vast territories across pre-medieval Europe. These tribes relied on various forms of sorcery to address the challenges they faced in their daily lives. The term "AbsenceGermanic" suggests a focus on the evocation of energies that are absent, invisible, or intangible, allowing the practitioner to harness, manipulate, and direct these forces. In this section, we will explore the core principles, sigils, and rituals of AbsenceGermanic sorcery, providing clear and detailed guidance for aspiring occultists.

### II. Core Principles of AbsenceGermanic Sorcery

A. Connection to Nature

Ancient Germanic tribes valued their connection to the natural world, recognizing their dependence on the elements. As a result, AbsenceGermanic sorcery emphasizes environmental awareness and the manipulation of natural energies to achieve practical ends.

B. The Intangible Forces

AbsenceGermanic sorcery focuses on the control and utilization of energies that lie beyond the perception of the human senses. These intangible forces include auras, ethereal vibrations, and the currents of mana that flow through the cosmos.

C. Balance and Equilibrium

The practice of AbsenceGermanic sorcery is rooted in the concept of balance, as stability is needed to harness and control powerful forces. Magick is based on the equilibrium of complementary forces, such as light and darkness, creation and destruction, and positive and negative energies.

### III. Practices and Elements

A. Sigils and Runes

AbsenceGermanic sorcery incorporates symbols and runes as a means of accessing and channeling the desired energies. These sigils embody the essence of a specific force and act as a bridge between the physical world and the realm of absent energies. Examples of powerful sigils frequently utilized in AbsenceGermanic sorcery include Dagaz (transformation), Eihwaz (endurance), and Mannaz (collective consciousness).

B. Rituals and Ceremonies

In order to effectively harness and control the energies of AbsenceGermanic sorcery, practitioners must engage in elaborate rituals and ceremonies. These ceremonies may involve invoking the elements, reciting incantations, or employing the use of various ritual tools, such as wands, staves, or cauldrons.

C. Meditation and Visualization

Mastery of AbsenceGermanic sorcery requires the development of mental discipline and clarity. As such, meditation and visualization are critical components of the practice. Through these techniques, practitioners can attune their minds to the energies they seek, allowing them to both understand and manipulate these forces with precision.

### IV. Classic Spells and Real-World Applications

A. Protection Spell

The Rune of Algiz, symbolizing protection and shielding, can be incorporated into a protective talisman. Engrave the rune on a piece of wood, stone, or metal, and charge it with your intention during a ritual. Carry the talisman with you to ward off negative energies and ensure your safety in challenging situations.

B. Healing Spell

By harnessing the power of the Sowilu rune, which represents light and life force, practitioners can aid in the healing process. Create a healing pouch by placing a piece of clear quartz, sunstone, or amber, along with a parchment inscribed with the Sowilu rune, into a small cloth pouch. Hold the pouch over the afflicted area or let the recipient carry it with them as they recuperate.

C. Prosperity Spell

The Fehu rune is associated with wealth and prosperity. To attract abundance, draw the Fehu rune on a piece of paper or parchment and place it in a safe or wallet. Alternatively, you can also create a charm using a coin or piece of pyrite inscribed with the rune and carry it with you to magnetize wealth.

In conclusion, AbsenceGermanic sorcery is a rich and fascinating aspect of esoteric knowledge, drawing from ancient practices to offer powerful tools for modern occultists. By studying and understanding its principles, practices, and history, one can expand their knowledge and cultivate a deeper connection with the natural world and the invisible forces that shape our lives.
