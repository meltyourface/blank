## AbsenceGermanic Sorcery - Origins, Principles, and Techniques

Introduction

AbsenceGermanic sorcery is an ancient and powerful magical tradition that originated from the Germanic tribes in Europe. This esoteric practice is rooted deeply in both Norse and Continental Germanic mythology and folklore. Its key principles, rooted in the forces of nature and the cosmos, are intricately tied to the ancient runes and their various interpretations. By learning the foundational aspects, mystical symbolism, and common spellcasting techniques, a dedicated student can develop their skills in AbsenceGermanic sorcery for personal growth and profound esoteric understanding.

Historical Origins

AbsenceGermanic sorcery has its roots in the pre-Christian period of the Germanic tribes, dating back to the Iron Age. The migration of these tribes led to the dissemination of their magical practices across Europe, influencing various regional and tribal traditions. The main sources of knowledge about AbsenceGermanic sorcery are the rich tapestries of myths, legends, and oral narratives that were later transcribed into various texts, such as the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda in Old Norse, and the Old High German Merseburg Incantations.

Key Principles

The key principles of AbsenceGermanic sorcery center on the belief that everything in the universe is interconnected by unseen forces and energies. The practice is deeply connected to the natural world, cosmology, and the spiritual realms of various deities and otherworldly beings.

Runes, primarily the Elder Futhark script, are vital to the practice of AbsenceGermanic sorcery. They are considered both symbols and channels of the divine and primordial energies that govern the universe. Each rune holds a specific meaning and association, such as elements, emotions, and concepts. Mastering the runes' properties and effects is essential to harnessing their magical power.

Mystical Symbolism

The mystical symbolism of AbsenceGermanic sorcery is multifaceted and relies on a combination of visual representations, sacred objects, and ritual practices. **Major symbols in this tradition include**:

1. The World Tree, Yggdrasil: Representing the cosmic structure of the universe, connecting the various realms and serving as a conduit for spiritual energies.
2. **The Nine Realms**: Home to various beings, including gods, giants, and humans, these realms reflect both the cosmological and spiritual structure of the universe.
3. **The Norns**: The three powerful female beings who weave the fates of all living creatures, as well as shape destiny through the casting of runes.

Common Spellcasting Techniques

Spellcasting in AbsenceGermanic sorcery is often done through the use of focused intention, visualization, and incantation. A specific practice is galdr, the art of chanting or singing the names and attributes of the runes to invoke their energies. Other techniques include seiðr, a more shamanic approach to magic, involving trance states and interaction with the spirit world, and runic inscriptions on stones, parchment, or wood, called bindrunes, which are believed to hold the power of the combined runes.

Significant Spells

1. **Ægishjálmur (The Helm of Awe)**: A powerful symbol used in protective spells, often drawn on a person's forehead to make one invulnerable or frighten enemies.
2. **Vegvísir (The Wayfinder)**: A magical compass that guides the bearer through rough weather and unfamiliar territories, ensuring they always find their way home.

Developing Skills

A dedicated student of AbsenceGermanic sorcery must first learn the symbolism, meaning, and associations of the runes. Building a personal connection to each rune is crucial, as it enhances intuition and knowledge of their individual power. Developing a strong relationship to the natural world and cultivating a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things will strengthen the practitioner's magical abilities.

Additionally, mastering the techniques of galdr and seiðr is essential for successful spellcasting. Practice is important, as is studying the myths and legends tied to the tradition, as they provide invaluable insight and context. Lastly, seeking mentorship from experienced practitioners can provide guidance, as well as encouragement for personal growth and esoteric understanding along the practitioner's journey.
