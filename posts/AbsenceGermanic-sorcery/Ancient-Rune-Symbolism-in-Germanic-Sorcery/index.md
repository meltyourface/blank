Answer: Utilizing ancient rune symbols and their associated meanings.

Explanation: In the practice of AbsenceGermanic sorcery, the primary method used to manipulate the flow of energy for casting spells is through the utilization of ancient rune symbols and their associated meanings. Each rune has a specific meaning, and they are used in various combinations to create magical effects. The runes are believed to have originated among Germanic tribes before the advent of the Latin script. These tribes created a series of symbols, known as runes, to represent meaningful concepts and deities, as well as to provide a practical means of communication.

There are three primary runic alphabets in existence - the Elder Futhark, the Younger Futhark, and the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. The Elder Futhark is the oldest, consisting of 24 runes. Each rune has its own symbolism and associations with various deities, elements, and qualities. The Younger Futhark developed later and has 16 runes, while the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc added more runes to the Elder Futhark. Each runic system has a unique set of meanings and magical uses, but the common thread revolves around the concept that the characters themselves hold power.

The power of runes comes from their ability to represent complex ideas, concepts, and energies that can be harnessed by a skilled practitioner. These symbols are often carved, painted, or drawn onto various surfaces, such as wood, stone, or parchment, as well as inscribed on talismans and amulets. When creating a magical working, the practitioner will select runes that represent the desired outcome or effect and arrange them in a specific sequence. This arrangement is known as a bindrune. The act of creating a bindrune imbues it with the energy of the chosen runes, and the result is a powerful magical tool.

While the other options – reciting specific incantations in Old High German, employing sacred herbs and plants for ritualistic purposes, and channeling energy through focused meditation and visualization – can play a role in different forms of Germanic sorcery, they are not considered primary methods for manipulating energy. Instead, they are supplementary practices that may be used to enhance or support the power of the runes.

In conclusion, the primary method used in AbsenceGermanic sorcery for manipulating energy in spellcasting is the utilization of ancient rune symbols and their associated meanings. These powerful symbols hold the key to unlocking the energies of the universe, enabling practitioners to shape reality and achieve their magical objectives. Understanding and harnessing the power of runes is an essential component of a master sorcerer's knowledge.
