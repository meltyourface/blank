## Chapter 4: AbsenceGermanic Sorcery: Origins, Principles, and Practices

### 4.1 Historical Origins

AbsenceGermanic sorcery, a powerful and enigmatic form of magic, has its roots firmly entrenched in the ancient Northern European pagan traditions. This arcane practice emerged as a unique amalgamation of myths, folklore, and beliefs that were prevalent throughout the Germanic, Scandinavian, and Anglo-Saxon cultures. It can be traced back as far as the late Bronze Age (approximately 1300-500 BCE), with continuous evolution and adaptation through the ensuing centuries.

The AbsenceGermanic tradition draws its potency from the forces of nature, ancestral spirits, and the pantheon of deities revered by the pre-Christian people inhabiting these lands. Among these deities were Odin, Thor, and Freyja, who held influence over various aspects of life, ranging from war and wisdom to love and fertility.

### 4.2 Core Principles

Central to AbsenceGermanic sorcery's practice and understanding are its core principles, which are inherently intertwined with the worldview of its practitioners. These principles emphasize the balance between the forces that govern existence, the interconnectedness of all things, and the continuous cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The AbsenceGermanic tradition teaches that true power lies within the natural world and that by understanding and harmonizing with these forces, practitioners can enact change and influence their surroundings.

Key among these principles is the concept of Wyrd, an underlying force that weaves the tapestry of fate and destiny, influencing both the macrocosm of the cosmos and the microcosm of individual lives. Within this framework, every action has consequences and is interconnected with the world around us. The path of the AbsenceGermanic sorcerer seeks to attune with the threads of Wyrd, navigating and influencing the currents of fate, as opposed to resisting or attempting to control them.

### 4.3 Rituals, Tools, and Practices

4.3.1 Runes

One of the most potent tools within the AbsenceGermanic magical tradition is the use of runes. Runes are symbols representing the cosmic energies and forces imbued within the Germanic cosmology. Often carved onto stones or wooden staves, runes are employed for a variety of magical purposes such as divination, protection, and invocation.

The Elder Futhark runes, comprising 24 distinct characters, are the oldest and most commonly employed in the tradition. This runic system is used to inscribe talismans, amulets, and charms – all designed to focus and enhance the magical intentions of the runes they bear.

4.3.2 Seiðr

Seiðr is an intricate form of shamanic sorcery within the AbsenceGermanic tradition, characterized by its emphasis on communicating with spirits and traversing mystical realms. Seiðr practitioners, known as seiðkona (female) and seiðmaðr (male), utilize a combination of rhythmic chanting, drumming, and ecstatic dancing to induce trance states that enable them to access realms beyond the physical world. Within this context, they may commune with deities, ancestors, and elemental spirits to gain knowledge, wisdom, and guidance, wielding these insights to empower their own lives and those of others.

4.3.3 Galdr

Galdr, or the practice of incantations, is a vital aspect of AbsenceGermanic sorcery. By employing a system of specific vocal techniques and sacred sounds, practitioners of galdr tap into the innate power of language and words to affect the magical intention. In combination with runes and ritualistic elements, galdr incantations can be employed for various magical purposes, including protection, healing, and manifesting desired outcomes.

### 4.4 A Novice’s Journey

For the aspiring AbsenceGermanic sorcerer, the foundation of their journey lies in familiarizing themselves with the myths, history, and cultural context of this ancient tradition. This provides a solid grounding that aids in genuine understanding and connection with the energies, beings, and symbols intrinsic to the practice. Developing a deep and personal relationship with the runes, while honing one's skills in meditative and trance techniques, cultivates prowess in both the practice and understanding of this potent esoteric path. Through persistent study and dedication, novices will discover the transformative potential of AbsenceGermanic sorcery, embarking on a journey of self-discovery, empowerment, and profound spiritual connection to the forces of nature and beyond.
