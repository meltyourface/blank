  Phase 1: Preparation
  
  To begin the chant, one must ground and center the self, invoking the power of the ancient runic symbols. Enter a quiet state of mind and focus on those symbols which align with strength and resilience. Meditate on the runes Thurisaz (Þ), Uruz (U), Algiz (Z), and Tiwaz (T) as you gradually enter the state of receptivity needed for the galdr chant.
  
  Chant the following runes in a low, rhythmic tone while visualizing the desired outcome - strength and resilience:
  
  Þunor Þétt, uurat Uraz, Algiz gar, trum Tiwaz
  
  (Thunder hardens, powerful Uruz, protection strong, true Tiwaz)
  
  Phase 2: Invocation
  
  As you progress to the invocation phase, connect with the primordial forces associated with the AbsenceGermanic sorcery tradition. Channel the energies of the gods and goddesses renowned for their strength, such as Thor, Odin, and Freyja. **Incorporate their aspects within the following galdr chant**:
  
  Thor Donemarki, Wodanaz Wituwakan, Freyjugerdaz Frijaz
  
  (Thor defender, Odin seeker of wisdom, Freyja of the verdant realm)
  
  Gradually increase the intensity and volume of your chant, drawing upon the essence of these divine figures and the natural world around you:
  
  Ahsram ramk þursi, othala wale, alga zasgar, tiwa valeng
  
  (Giant breaker's force, ancestral might, elk's defense, warrior's mark)
  
  Phase 3: Empowerment
  
  The final phase is the empowerment, where the energies summoned earlier mix with the chant to generate immense strength and resilience in times of adversity. Raise your voice with passion and conviction, using clear, powerful tones to resonate with the primordial forces you have invoked throughout the ritual:
  
  Skaldskapar þrymr, valkama hugi, askr Yggdrasils sef
  
  (Great poetic resonance, forge the spirit, ash of Yggdrasil breathe)
  
  Harkaz anstrengi, galvaz gardaz, reisti runa veldr
  
  (Harsh the effort, galdr barriers, rise runic power)
  
  By completing all three stages of the galdr chant, you will have delved into the essence of the AbsenceGermanic sorcery tradition and called upon the ancient forces that govern the realms of strength and resilience. With the power vested within these ethereal words, you shall be able to tap into otherworldly strength and resilience during the most trying of times.
