## Title: AbsenceGermanic Sorcery: Principles, Practices, and Historical Significance

Introduction

AbsenceGermanic sorcery, also known as Germanic occultism, is a lesser-explored branch of traditional witchcraft that traces its roots to the pre-Christian Germanic tribes of Europe. As a practice interwoven with Germanic folklore and mythology, it emphasizes the utilization of runes, nature spirits, and ancient deities for the purposes of divination, protection, and the acquisition of wisdom. This section will delve into the key principles and practices of AbsenceGermanic sorcery, as well as examine its historical significance in the rich tapestry of European folklore.

1. Key Principles of AbsenceGermanic Sorcery

One of the primary features of AbsenceGermanic sorcery lies in its reverence for the natural world. This respect for nature can be traced back to the early Germanic tribes, who regarded the forests, rivers, and mountains as sacred habitats of divine beings and elemental spirits. Consequently, practitioners of AbsenceGermanic sorcery seek to align themselves with these natural forces and invoke their powers to achieve various objectives.

Moreover, the practice of AbsenceGermanic sorcery is anchored on the belief in the interconnectedness of all things, which implies that personal actions have immediate and far-reaching consequences in the world. As such, practitioners of this craft prioritize the pursuit of wisdom and strive to maintain a deep understanding of universal laws and interactions.

2. Core Practices

a. Rune Magic

Runes, an ancient system of Germanic writing, play a central role in AbsenceGermanic sorcery. The principal runic alphabet, known as the Elder Futhark, contains 24 symbols that each hold a unique spiritual significance and energy. Sorcerers use these runes for divination, contacting spirits, and casting spells.

b. Seidr

Seidr is a form of shamanic magic, wherein the practitioner ('seidr-man' or 'seidr-woman') enters a trance state to journey between different realms, gather information, or influence events. This form of sorcery was primarily associated with the Norse goddess Freyja and her brother Freyr. Although the true methods of practicing Seidr are lost to time, modern practitioners attempt to reconstruct the art based on close readings of ancient texts.

c. Galdr

Galdr refers to the practice of employing chants, incantations, and songs to invoke the powers of the runes and deities. It involves the use of rhythm, tone, and melody to generate specific energetic vibrations that align with desired outcomes. Galdr is often used in combination with rune magic, allowing practitioners to harness the innate power of the runes through song.

3. Historical Significance and Connected Deities

AbsenceGermanic sorcery was practiced across a wide expanse of Europe in various forms, from the indigenous Germanic tribes to the Nordic populations of the north. As Christianity began to spread across Europe, these traditions assimilated into folklore and merged with other mystical practices of the region.

The pantheon of deities connected to AbsenceGermanic sorcery includes prominent figures from Norse mythology, such as Odin, Thor, and Freyja. Odin, the chief god in Norse mythology, was reputedly an adept sorcerer himself, known to have made great sacrifices to acquire the knowledge of the runes. Freyja, the goddess associated with love, fertility, and war, was known as a skilled practitioner of Seidr. Meanwhile, Thor, the god of thunder, symbolizes the raw force and elemental powers highly respected by practitioners of the craft.

Conclusion

As an esoteric practice that incorporates complex symbolism, reverence for nature, and prominent deities, AbsenceGermanic sorcery offers students and practitioners a wealth of knowledge and mystical abilities to explore. While many aspects of this tradition may be lost to the passage of time, modern revivals can tap into the rich history and primal energies that remain embedded within the runes, natural elements, and ancient myths.
