To respond to this challenge, it is important to first establish a foundational understanding of the main concepts: Absence within Germanic sorcery, the role of the Norns in shaping fate, and the principles and application of rune magic in accordance with the natural order of the cosmos. With these foundations set, we can explore their interconnection and address the knowledge challenge at hand.

- Absence within Germanic sorcery: In the context of Germanic sorcery, the concept of absence is deeply rooted in the idea of unseen forces. Absence often refers to the intangible, formless, or hidden dimensions of power that can be accessed, manipulated, or controlled by practitioners of sorcery. It is these hidden aspects that reveal potent energies waiting to be harnessed and directed toward one's will.

- The role of the Norns in shaping fate: In Norse mythology, the Norns are supernatural beings often described as three sisters who determine the fates of individuals by weaving the threads of their lives. They represent the past, present, and future, and their woven threads symbolize the intricate and interconnected nature of existence. The Norns possess immense power and knowledge, with a deep understanding of the cosmic order.

- Principles and application of rune magic: Rune magic is a form of sorcery utilizing the ancient symbols known as runes, which embody the fundamental energies of the cosmos. By carving, inscribing, or otherwise employing these runes in specific configurations, practitioners can connect with the primordial forces they represent and utilize them for various purposes, such as protection, guidance, or transformation. Rune magic embodies a respect for the natural order of the cosmos and seeks to harmonize with it, channeling its power and wisdom.

Now, let us examine the relationships between these concepts. The concept of absence within Germanic sorcery can be first linked to the Norns, as they are unseen entities, yet they hold incredible power over the lives of individuals. Their work manifests as fate, the omnipresent force that invisibly guides all actions and events. Similarly, the unseen energies harnessed in rune magic align with the concept of absence. These energies are derived from the very fabric of the cosmos and impart profound influence, despite not having a tangible or easily perceivable form.

Furthermore, the Norns' craft of weaving the threads of life into an intricate tapestry reflects the way rune magic aligns with the natural order of the cosmos. Just as the Norns work with the cosmic order to shape fate, practitioners of rune magic seek to harmonize with the underlying energies of the universe. By understanding and applying runes, they tap into the same forces that the Norns themselves utilize in shaping destiny.

One can imagine the relationship between these concepts as a vast, interconnected web, with each thread representing a different aspect of existence, whether it is the hidden forces of absence or the cosmic order in harmony with rune magic. As a practitioner of Germanic sorcery, working within this web entails understanding the principles of rune magic, connecting with the unseen energies, and acknowledging the role of the Norns in shaping fate.

In conclusion, the interconnection between the concept of absence within Germanic sorcery, the role of the Norns in shaping fate, and the principles and application of rune magic entails a deep interplay of unseen forces, respect for cosmic order, and the influence of supernatural entities. These concepts exist in a complex and intertwined relationship, illustrating the broader tapestry of existence as a dance between the hidden and the tangible, destiny and individual will, and the natural order and the potential for transformation.
