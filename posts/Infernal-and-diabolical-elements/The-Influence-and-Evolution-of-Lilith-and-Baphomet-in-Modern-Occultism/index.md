To fully grasp the significance of Lilith and Baphomet's influences within the realm of modern occult and esoteric thought, it is crucial to consider their historical origins, cultural contexts, and transformations in portrayals throughout the centuries. In this response, I will first provide a brief overview of the characters and their backgrounds before delving into comparative studies of their impact on occult thought, considering societal and cultural influences that have transformed their perceptions.

Lilith, a figure with origins tracing back to Mesopotamian mythology, is often depicted as a demon or a dark goddess with a strong association with sensuality, defiance, and feminine power. Initially appearing in the Sumerian myth as a female storm demon, Lilith eventually became part of Jewish folklore as Adam's first wife, who refused to be subservient, thus asserting her independence. Over time, her mythos grew and incorporated elements of the rebellious feminine and sexual freedom, making her a potent symbol in feminist and esoteric movements, particularly those that emphasize female empowerment or explore "darker" aspects of spirituality.

Baphomet, on the other hand, is a more recent invention that seems to have originated as an object of worship falsely accused against the Knights Templar during their trials in the early 14th century. Later, in the 19th century, French occultist Eliphas Levi depicted Baphomet as a horned, androgynous figure with an emphasis on the union of opposites and divine wisdom. This depiction resonated with esoteric societies, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Church of Satan, resulting in Baphomet being adopted as a symbol of esoteric wisdom, as well as an icon of rebellion against conventional religious ideals.

In the context of modern occult thought, both Lilith and Baphomet play significant roles, albeit with different functions and implications. Lilith, as a symbol of liberation, feminine power, and even "shadow work" in psychological terms, often inspires those seeking to break free from societal constraints and traditions. She provides an archetype through which individuals can explore the darker aspects of their nature without fear. The figure of Lilith often features prominently in feminist and left-hand path magic practices, which emphasizes self-discovery, empowerment, and personal transformation.

Baphomet, conversely, serves a broader role within the esoteric world, representing a more all-encompassing symbol of spiritual understanding and divine wisdom. Baphomet embodies the concept of reconciling opposites and contradictions, unifying them in the pursuit of a higher understanding of reality and the self. Its androgynous nature and transformative characteristics have led to a wide range of interpretations and uses, from esoteric mysticism to more sinister and Satanic connotations in pop culture. Ultimately, Baphomet acts as an icon for those discontented with mainstream religion and seeking greater spiritual awareness.

Both Lilith and Baphomet have evolved considerably through time, and their eventual adoption into occult practices can be attributed to various social, cultural, and psychological factors. The symbols of Lilith and Baphomet signify defiance and individuality and become representative of collective discontent and rebellion against societal norms and structures.

In conclusion, Lilith and Baphomet hold unique yet complementary positions within the landscape of modern occult and esoteric thought. While Lilith serves as a potent symbol of feminine power, defiance, and personal exploration, Baphomet represents a more all-encompassing and transformative vision of spiritual enlightenment and divine wisdom. The growth of their influence has been shaped by various social and cultural contexts in which they have become potent symbols of rebellion and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge beyond traditional religious constraints. Their continued relevance highlights the adaptability of these mythical figures to address humanity's ever-evolving spiritual and intellectual needs.
