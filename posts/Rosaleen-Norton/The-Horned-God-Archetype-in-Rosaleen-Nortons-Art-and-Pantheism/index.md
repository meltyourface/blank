In order to fully respond to the knowledge challenge on the symbolic relationships between Rosaleen Norton's artistic representations of the Horned God, her interpretation of the Faustian pact in "Gavin Greenlees' Goblin Feast," and her personal experiences with that archetype in her practice of Pantheism, we must first delve into understanding each of these elements and the cultural context surrounding them.

Rosaleen Norton (1917-1979) was an Australian artist and occultist, whose work was heavily influenced by mythology, mysticism, and the natural world. She was a pioneer in the growing pagan and occult movements in mid-20th-century Australia, and her exploration and reinterpretation of traditional archetypes laid the foundation for contemporary transformative expressions of esotericism.

### I. The Horned God as an Archetype

The Horned God is an ancient archetype representing the masculine aspect of divinity, fertility, and the forces of nature. Norton's Horned God was heavily influenced by the Greek god Pan, commonly depicted with the horns, legs, and beard of a goat, as well as the mythological figures of Dionysus and Cernunnos. Norton's paintings frequently featured this deity as a powerful, primal being, embodying the untamed wilderness and the instinctual passions of humanity.

In Norton's artwork, the Horned God is shown as a potent force for transformation and regeneration, with both dark and light aspects. Her interpretation emphasizes the powerful nature of the archetype, which she recognized as a source of energy that could be harnessed for spiritual growth and self-discovery, transcending the limitations of conventional morality.

### II. The Faustian Pact in "Gavin Greenlees' Goblin Feast"

"Gavin Greenlees' Goblin Feast" is a poem by Norton's fellow occultist and romantic partner, Gavin Greenlees, which was illustrated by Norton herself. The poem explores themes of desire, temptation, and the tension between the material and spiritual worlds, drawing inspiration from the Faustian legend of an individual who makes a pact with the devil to gain forbidden knowledge or power.

In Norton's illustrations for this poem, she connects the themes of the Faustian pact with the energy of the Horned God, depicting sensuous, otherworldly creatures and dark, tangled landscapes. The interplay of desire, spiritual growth, and transformation is evident in these images, as Norton explores the duality of dark and light forces and their impact on the human soul.

### III. Personal Experiences with the Archetype

As a practitioner of Pantheism and occultism, Norton had personal experiences with the Horned God archetype, often seeking communion with this deity through ritual, meditation, and visionary states. She believed in the transformative power of connecting with this primal energy, and her experiences served as inspiration and validation for her artistic representations of the Horned God.

For Norton, the Horned God was a potent symbol of individuality, freedom, and the need to continually challenge one's limitations in order to fully embrace one's true nature. This personal relationship with the archetype manifested in her artwork and her philosophical beliefs, representing a unique, innovative approach to spiritual growth within mid-20th-century Australian occultism.

### IV. Implications for the Evolution of Mid-20th-Century Australian Occultism

Norton's exploration of the Horned God, the Faustian pact, and her personal experiences with these archetypes had a profound impact on the evolution of mid-20th-century Australian occultism. By forging a new understanding of these symbols and their potential for transformation, Norton contributed to the emergence of a more diverse, eclectic, and radical approach to spirituality that resonated with many individuals seeking alternative forms of spiritual expression.

In conclusion, the symbolic relationships between Rosaleen Norton's artistic representations of the Horned God, her interpretation of the Faustian pact in "Gavin Greenlees' Goblin Feast," and her personal experiences with that archetype in her practice of Pantheism reveal a deep, transformative understanding of the power of myths, archetypes, and the natural world to inspire spiritual growth and creativity. Norton's work and experiences served as a catalyst for the evolution of mid-20th-century Australian occultism, paving the way for future generations to explore new paths towards self-discovery and transcendence.
