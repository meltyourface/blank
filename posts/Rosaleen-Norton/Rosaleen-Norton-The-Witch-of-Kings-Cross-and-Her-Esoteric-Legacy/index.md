## Rosaleen Norton: The Witch of Kings Cross and her Magical Practices

### I. Introduction

Rosaleen Norton (1917-1979) was an Australian artist and occultist, widely known as 'The Witch of Kings Cross.' Born in Dunedin, New Zealand, she moved with her family to Sydney, where she spent most of her adult life. Norton's artwork and magical practices challenged the conservative norms of her time, while her iconoclastic lifestyle, exploration of esotericism, and celebration of the divine feminine paved the way for the modern occult scene. This chapter delves into the life, magical practices, and artistic contributions of Rosaleen Norton, focusing on her beliefs, influences, and the impact she had on the modern occult scene.

### II. Beliefs and Philosophies

At the core of Norton's beliefs was a fascination with pantheism, or the principle that the divine is present in every aspect of nature. This perspective inspired Norton to explore various spiritual traditions, from Indo-European paganism and Greek mythology to Eastern mysticism and Kabbalistic symbolism. Her metaphysical approach was syncretic, as she sought to draw inspiration from these diverse sources, weaving them into a coherent, albeit highly personal, spiritual practice.

One of Norton's primary influences was the British occultist Aleister Crowley, who she admired for his esoteric knowledge and subversive character. Norton incorporated many of Crowley's ideas, such as the principles of Thelema ('Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law') and the significance of ritual and ceremonial magic, into her own work. However, her practice diverged from Crowley's in several key aspects, particularly in its emphasis on the feminine divine, the role of trance states, and a more instinctual, less dogmatic approach to her art and spiritual life.

### III. Magical Practices

Central to Norton's magical practices was the practice of ritual. In her personal rituals, she experimented with various forms of ceremonial magic, invocations, and astral travel. Norton's approach to ritual was highly imaginative and replete with symbolism, as demonstrated in her elaborate altars, which featured items such as candles, crystals, magical weapons, and images of the gods and goddesses she revered.

Another crucial aspect of Norton's magical practice was the cultivation of trance states and visionary experiences. Employing techniques such as deep meditation, rhythmic dancing, and sensory deprivation, she sought to access altered states of consciousness that allowed her to tap into her intuition, creativity, and the collective unconscious. Through these methods, she believed she could communicate with supernatural entities and harness her psychic potential.

### IV. Artistic Contributions

Norton's artistic output was extensive, ranging from drawings and paintings to poetry and essays. She is best known for her intricate and evocative pen drawings. Symbolism pervades her work, further testament to her syncretic spiritual approach. Mythological figures, such as Pan, Hecate, and Lilith are regular features in her art, as well as supernatural creatures, like elementals and astral entities.

One of her defining artistic achievements was her book, "The Art of Rosaleen Norton," published in 1952, with poems by her close collaborator, Gavin Greenlees. It showcased her unique approach to art and esotericism and proved controversial, with copies being seized by Australian Customs under charges of obscenity.

### V. Connections and Impact on Modern Occultism

Throughout her life, Norton maintained connections with peers and other occult practitioners, such as Australian witchcraft exponent, Wiccan High Priestess Patricia Crowther and eccentric Australian artist and poet, Barry Humphries. She held salon-like gatherings at her home, where artists, writers, and seekers of the esoteric would converge to discuss magic, art, and philosophy.

Norton's impact on modern occultism is multifaceted. Her embrace of the feminine divine inspired subsequent generations of witches and occultists, while her artistic style and iconography continue to influence contemporary artists within the esoteric community. Moreover, Norton's refusal to bow to social convention, her celebration of sexual freedom and individual autonomy, and her determination to pursue her own spiritual vision in the face of adversity have secured her place as an iconic figure and trailblazer within the modern occult scene.
