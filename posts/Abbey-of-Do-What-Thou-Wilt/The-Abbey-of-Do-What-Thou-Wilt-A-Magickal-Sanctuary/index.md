The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt: A Treatise on its Philosophy, Practices, and Core Tenets

### I. Overview and Historical Context

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt, a key establishment in the annals of esoteric history, serves as both a sanctuary and educational institution for practitioners of occult arts. Rooted in the teachings of Aleister Crowley, the infamous early 20th-century occultist, and founded amidst the spiritual and cultural turmoil of the era, the Abbey provides a haven for those seeking knowledge, wisdom, and mastery in the mysterious world of the arcane.

### II. The Philosophy of True Will

At the heart of the Abbey's philosophy lies the concept of True Will. This core tenet, derived from Crowley's Thelemic teachings, posits that every individual has a unique, divine purpose that should be discovered and fulfilled. To fully embrace and actualize one's True Will is to achieve total harmony and unity with the universe, allowing for both personal growth and the spiritual elevation of humanity as a whole.

### III. The Law of Thelema

Central to the Abbey's doctrine is the Law of Thelema, a principle dictating that, when fully embracing one's True Will, one's actions are guided by the maxim, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This law, at once simple and profound, encourages practitioners to cast away societal constraints and delve into a world of unrestricted self-discovery, brought to fruition through the pursuit of their inherent spiritual destiny.

### IV. Magick and Esoteric Practices

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt serves not only as a place of philosophical study but also as a locus of instruction in various magickal and esoteric practices. From ceremonial magic and divination to more obscure paths such as sex magick and the exploration of altered states of consciousness, the Abbey imparts to its followers the necessary tools and techniques to deepen their mastery over the hidden forces of the cosmos. Striking a balance between theoretical knowledge and experiential wisdom, the Abbey's curriculum cultivates well-rounded magicians capable of channeling the very essence of their True Will.

### V. Key Figures and Contributions

Beyond the foundational influence of Aleister Crowley, the Abbey has also benefited from the contributions of various key figures over time, each of whom has enriched the institution with their own distinct discoveries and insights. Prominent authorities and practitioners within the Abbey have helped to keep its teachings adaptable and evolving, allowing the Abbey to continue to serve as a beacon of enlightenment for generations of occult aspirants.
