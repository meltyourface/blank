The philosophical foundations of "Do What Thou Wilt" within the context of the Abbey have their roots in the works of Aleister Crowley, an influential occultist, writer, and ceremonial magician, particularly in his religious philosophy of Thelema. To better understand this principle and to expound upon the interplay of individualism, personal responsibility, and interconnectedness within esoteric traditions and practices, we can break down our examination into three primary steps: 1) understanding the concept of "Do What Thou Wilt", 2) exploring the core principles of individualism, personal responsibility, and interconnectedness as they relate to esoteric practices, and 3) analyzing potential conflicts or synergies between these concepts.

1) "Do What Thou Wilt":
"Do What Thou Wilt" is a central tenet of Thelema. It refers to the idea that every individual has a unique, inalienable True Will, which is their ultimate purpose in life. This concept of the True Will extends beyond mere desire or whim; it represents the individual's highest potential, uninhibited by societal norms, expectations, or morality. The principle of "Do What Thou Wilt" encourages the individual to pursue their True Will fully and without reservation so that they may become the fullest expression of their potential and achieve self-actualization.

2) Core Principles:
a) Individualism: Within the context of esoteric practices, individualism emphasizes the importance and power of the unique consciousness and perspective that each person possesses. This aligns with the "Do What Thou Wilt" philosophy, as it acknowledges the importance of each person's individuality and supports the belief in one's own moral and spiritual responsibility.

b) Personal Responsibility: Esotericism often holds that individuals must take responsibility for their own spiritual growth and development. "Do What Thou Wilt" further emphasizes the significance of personal responsibility by suggesting that individuals should seek to understand and fulfill their True Will. Thus, personal responsibility becomes not just a moral obligation but an existential one.

c) Interconnectedness: Various esoteric traditions recognize the interconnectedness of all things, stressing the importance of relationships between the individual and the wider world. This concept can coexist with the "Do What Thou Wilt" philosophy through the harmonizing of one's True Will with their understanding of their position in the grand scheme of the universe.

3) Conflicts and Synergies:
The integration of individualism, personal responsibility, and interconnectedness with the concept of "Do What Thou Wilt" can generate both conflicts and synergies within esoteric practices. A potential conflict arises from the perceived clash between individualism and interconnectedness. Critics argue that the pursuit of one's True Will could lead to a form of moral or ethical relativism, paving the way for selfish or destructive behavior without considering the consequences for others or the environment.

However, there are potential synergies as well. For example, by prioritizing the fulfillment of one's True Will and individual potential, a person may be better equipped to contribute positively to their communities and the world at large. Additionally, the concept of interconnectedness can help to guide individuals in understanding how their unique True Wills can harmonize with and complement the greater cosmic order, ultimately benefitting both themselves and others.

In summary, the philosophical foundations of "Do What Thou Wilt" within the Abbey highlight the importance of individualism, personal responsibility, and interconnectedness within esoteric traditions and practices. While potential conflicts, such as ethical relativism, may arise when integrating these concepts, there are also synergies that can allow for a more holistic and enriching understanding of one's place and purpose in the universe. By seeking to fulfill their True Will, individuals can embark on a path of self-actualization and forge a deeper connection to the world around them, resulting in a more profound and fulfilling spiritual journey.
