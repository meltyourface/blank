To delve into the response to this knowledge challenge, we will first discuss the background and philosophical roots of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt in relation to Aleister Crowley's Thelemic teachings and the concept of individual sovereignty. Next, we will explore the correlation between this philosophy and the core Hermetic principle of "As Above, So Below." Finally, we will analyze how the significance of location, historical events, and the concept of spiritual sanctuaries intertwines within the narrative.

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt was founded by Aleister Crowley (1875 - 1947), a British writer, occultist, and ceremonial magician, who established his own spiritual system named Thelema. The central tenet of Thelema is the maxim "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,‚Äù which signifies that each individual should discover their own unique True Will, or the ultimate purpose of their life that aligns with their innermost desires and needs. In this context, individual sovereignty is expressed in the Thelemite's personal journey to uncover and fulfill their True Will without being constrained by societal norms or external expectations.

As for the Hermetic principle of "As Above, So Below," this ancient wisdom relates to the idea that everything in the cosmos is connected, meaning the macrocosm (the universe) reflects onto the microcosm (the individual). In simpler terms, this principle suggests that with robust understanding of oneself, one can glean deeper insight into the greater cosmos and vice versa. 

For the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt, this Hermetic principle enforces the idea that a person's True Will, when properly manifested, harmonizes with the natural order of the cosmos. Thus, by aligning themselves with their True Will, Thelemites inherently exemplify the interconnection of "As Above, So Below."

Now let's discuss how location, historical events, and the notion of spiritual sanctuaries tie into the Abbey's philosophy. Crowley established the Abbey in the early 20th century in the Sicilian countryside of Italy, with the intent of creating a spiritual retreat where individuals could focus on personal growth and understanding their True Will. The Abbey was meant to provide Thelemites with an isolated, sacred space separated from the distractions of mundane life.

Throughout history, the concept of spiritual sanctuaries has played a pivotal role for various religious practices and spiritual systems. These spaces offered initiates and practitioners the opportunity to concentrate on their spiritual progress undisturbed. The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt, like many such sanctuaries, provided a conducive environment for understanding the inherent connection between an individual's True Will, their place in the cosmos, and the Hermetic principle of "As Above, So Below."

In conclusion, the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt is deeply rooted in Aleister Crowley's Thelemic teachings that emphasize individual sovereignty and the discovery of one's True Will. Correlating with the Hermetic principle of "As Above, So Below," practitioners can understand how the manifestation of their True Will reflects and maintains harmony with the entire cosmos. Additionally, the significance of location, historical events, and the concept of spiritual sanctuaries has influenced the evolution, practice, and deeper contemplation of such teachings. The Abbey was established as a space for Thelemites to immerse themselves in this profound knowledge while pursuing their personal and spiritual growth.
