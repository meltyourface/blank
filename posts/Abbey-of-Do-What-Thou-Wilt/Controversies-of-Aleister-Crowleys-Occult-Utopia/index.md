Answer: Alleged immorality, art experiments, and the expulsion of foreign residents.

**Explanation**: The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt was a center of esoteric and occult practices founded by the infamous English occultist Aleister Crowley in 1920. Located in Cefal√π, Sicily, the Abbey was envisioned as a utopia, where people could engage in the exploration of Thelema, Crowley's spiritual system. However, this utopian experiment soon gave rise to several controversies surrounding its practices and philosophies. 

The allegations of immorality stem from the very core principle of Thelema: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This tenet was often interpreted by the public and critics as an endorsement of hedonistic and self-indulgent practices without any moral or ethical boundaries. Consequently, the Abbey became associated with tales of sexual practices, drug use, and unconventional rituals which further fueled controversies.

The controversies were also fueled by the unconventional art experiments that took place within the Abbey. Crowley was a firm believer in the magical power of art, and he encouraged the exploration of experimental forms of expression. The walls of the Abbey were decorated with images depicting provocative and blasphemous scenes, further shocking the general public and religious authorities. This eschewing artistic convention was intertwined with the essence of Thelema and played a significant role in the controversies that surrounded the Abbey.

Another factor contributing to the controversies was the expulsion of foreign residents. The Italian government had grown increasingly concerned with the presence and activities of the Abbey's denizens. Its notoriety led to media scrutiny and international backlash, especially from the British government. Finally, in 1923, under the regime of Benito Mussolini, Crowley and his entourage were issued an expulsion order, forcing them to leave Italy. This event marked the end of the Abbey as a center for Thelemic experimentation.

In summary, the combination of alleged immorality, unconventional art experiments, and the expulsion of foreign residents significantly contributed to the controversies surrounding the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt. These factors were intertwined, which reflected on Crowley's philosophy of Thelema, his practices as a spiritual leader, and the Abbey's perceived threat to the conventional norms and morality of the time.
