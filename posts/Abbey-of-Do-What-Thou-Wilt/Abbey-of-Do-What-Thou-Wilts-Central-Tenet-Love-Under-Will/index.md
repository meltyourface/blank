The answer to this question is: "Love is the law, love under will."

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt refers to teachings and philosophies found within Thelema, a spiritual and philosophical system founded by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century. Thelema emphasizes the individual's pursuit of spiritual truth and liberation, primarily achieved through the realization and expression of one's True Will. 

"Love is the law, love under will" arises from one of the central texts of Thelema, Liber AL vel Legis, or The Book of the Law. It reflects the primary rule of Thelema, expressing the concept that love and individual will are the essential forces driving our actions. It is interpreted as meaning that all actions in the world are acts of love, but only when these acts are conducted in accordance with one's True Will. Love, in this context, should not be seen as a purely emotional force but rather as the basis of unity between individual will and cosmic harmony.

The other options have significant meanings in different esoteric traditions but are not the primary tenet for the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt:

- "As above, so below" originates from the Hermetic tradition and refers to the idea that the microcosm (an individual or object) is a reflection of the macrocosm (the universe). While this concept is influential in various occult studies, it is not the primary focus of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt.

- "To dare, to know, to will, and to be silent" is known as the Four Powers of the Sphinx or the Four Powers of the Magus, a key element in several occult traditions. It refers to the essential qualities of a practitioner seeking knowledge and mastery over oneself and the world. While these aspects are present within the teachings of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt, they are not the central tenet.

- "Know thyself, and thou shalt know the Universe and Gods" is a phrase attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates and is emblematic of the pursuit of self-knowledge. This idea is closely related to the teachings of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt, as self-discovery is essential to understanding one's True Will, but it is not the primary tenet.

In conclusion, the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt emphasizes the individual's quest for spiritual truth and liberation, which is rooted in the discovery and manifestation of one's True Will. Love, as both a cosmic principle and the basis for all actions, is the overarching theme, guiding all aspects of this tradition.
