  In the context of Aleister Crowley's Abbey of Thelema and the philosophy of Thelemic ethics encoded within "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," describe the multifaceted implications and interconnections that can arise from exploring this principle in relation to the Great Work, the Highest Self, and the Qabalah.

To begin with, let us first understand the context of Aleister Crowley's Abbey of Thelema, and the central tenet its principles are built upon: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” This famous line comes from The Book of the Law, which Crowley received in 1904, and it serves as the foundation for the Thelemic ethical system. It refers to the idea that each individual has a True Will, a unique purpose or path to follow in life which should be discovered and followed with unwavering conviction. In this manner, people can attain spiritual, intellectual, and emotional growth.

Now, let us explore the multifaceted implications and interconnections that arise from this principle in relation to the Great Work, the Highest Self, and the Qabalah.

1. **The Great Work**:
The Great Work, or "Magnum Opus," refers to an individual's spiritual journey in pursuing self-awareness, self-transformation, and unity with the divine. Through the practice of aligning their thoughts and actions with their True Will, an individual embarks on the Great Work, seeking the realization of their own Higher Self, or "Holy Guardian Angel." By following "Do what thou wilt," individuals commit to discovering their True Will while navigating the complexities of life, ultimately bringing them closer to their spiritual purpose and achieving the Great Work.

2. **The Highest Self**:
Crowley believed that the main goal of each individual's spiritual journey is to unite with the Highest Self, transcending ego and material attachments. The Highest Self refers to an individual's inner divinity, their Holy Guardian Angel. By pursuing one's True Will, a person aligns their actions and motivations with the divine. This alignment enables the continuous growth and spiritual awakening required for connecting with the Highest Self. To achieve this union, we must overcome our intrinsic limitations through self-discovery and a commitment to our True Will throughout life. Embracing the "Do what thou wilt" principle, we remove what hinders our progress and recognize our Higher Self, experiencing an authentic sense of spiritual fulfillment.

3. **The Qabalah**:
The Qabalah is a mystical system of Jewish esotericism that offers insights into the divine and spiritual worlds. Crowley utilized the Qabalah in conjunction with his Thelemic principles as a framework to explore and explain the nature of existence and the inner workings of the human soul. In particular, he used the Tree of Life, a central symbol in the Qabalah, as a blueprint for representing the divine hierarchy and the individual's journey toward spiritual enlightenment.

As adherents explore the Qabalah within Thelema, they gain insights into their True Will and connect their actions with their spiritual path. The Tree of Life unites the microcosm, the individual's spiritual path, with the macrocosm, the greater universe, by mapping the ten Sephiroth (spheres) representing different aspects of the divine. Through understanding the Qabalah, an individual can identify their unique place within the larger cosmos, realizing their connections between the spiritual and the physical planes.

In conclusion, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" encompasses a broad range of implications and interconnections between the Great Work, the Highest Self, and the Qabalah. By understanding and pursuing one's True Will, an individual embarks on their journey towards the Great Work, striving to connect with their Higher Self and achieve spiritual enlightenment. The Qabalah serves as an invaluable tool to navigate the complexities of the inner and outer worlds, understand the individual's unique place within the cosmos, and ultimately bring them closer to the divine.
