In the context of the Abbey of Thelema and its importance in the development of modern occultism, three key individuals who played significant roles in the establishment and popularization of the doctrine of Thelema are Aleister Crowley, Marcelo Motta, and Kenneth Grant. Their respective contributions, interconnected doctrines, and their relationship to the fundamental motto, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," are explored in detail below.

1. Aleister Crowley (1875-1947)
Contribution: Aleister Crowley, an influential British occultist, mystic, and writer, is the founder of the religious movement known as Thelema. He established the Abbey of Thelema in 1920 in Cefalù, Sicily, as a center for spiritual study, exploration, and growth. The Abbey served as a place for initiates to practice and learn the rituals, ceremonies, and teachings of Thelema, which were highly controversial and scandalous at the time.

Interconnected doctrine: At the heart of Crowley's teachings is the central doctrine known as the Law of Thelema, expressed in the phrase, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This tenet emphasizes the profound importance of discovering and following one's True Will, or inner purpose, without interference from societal norms or expectations. Crowley taught that each individual has a unique True Will that, when known and followed, ensures both spiritual development and harmony with the universe.

2. Marcelo Motta (1931-1987)
Contribution: A Brazilian occultist, writer, and student of Aleister Crowley, Marcelo Motta was instrumental in maintaining and expanding the teachings of Thelema after Crowley's death. Motta wrote extensively on Thelemic philosophy and magick, played a pivotal role in preserving and publishing Crowley's works, and was an advocate for the legitimacy of Thelema as a religious and philosophical system.

Interconnected doctrine: Motta's contributions to the Thelemic doctrine are most notably represented in his writings on initiation and the True Will. In line with Crowley, Motta taught that the primary objective of the initiate is to seek and follow their True Will, reflecting the core motto of Thelema. He further emphasized the role of discipline, study, and self-examination in the process of realizing and actualizing one’s True Will.

3. Kenneth Grant (1924-2011)
Contribution: British occultist and writer Kenneth Grant was a leading figure in developing the modern understanding and practice of Thelema. A disciple of Aleister Crowley and a crucial torchbearer of Thelemic knowledge, Grant founded the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, an organization dedicated to exploring the darker, more esoteric aspects of Thelema and its connection to other occult systems like the Voudon Gnostic Current and the works of H.P. Lovecraft.

Interconnected doctrine: Kenneth Grant's contributions to the doctrine of Thelema include the examination of the Qliphothic Tree of Life and the role of the Nightside or the Shadow Self in realizing one's True Will. Though his approach diverged from traditional interpretations of Thelema, Grant still adhered to the fundamental teaching that each individual's primary duty is to discern and pursue their True Will, in accordance with the Law of Thelema.

In conclusion, Aleister Crowley, Marcelo Motta, and Kenneth Grant were three influential figures in the development, dissemination, and practice of Thelema, with the Abbey of Thelema playing a pivotal role in its early years. Each of these individuals emphasized the importance of discovering and following one's True Will, reflecting the central motto "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." Additionally, their interconnected teachings explored various aspects of Thelemic doctrine, from initiation to the integration of esoteric systems, and ensured the continued growth and evolution of Thelema.
