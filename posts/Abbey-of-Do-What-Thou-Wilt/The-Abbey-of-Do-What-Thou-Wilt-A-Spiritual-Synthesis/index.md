The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt: Origins, Teachings, and Practices

The Origins of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt traces its origins back to the early 20th century when it was founded by a group of like-minded occultists and esoteric thinkers, led by an enigmatic figure whose identity has been enshrouded in mystery and myth. These founders sought to create a spiritual sanctuary where individuals could explore their deepest desires and discover their true purpose through the practice of the esoteric arts, uninhibited by societal constraints or dogmatic religious beliefs.

Founding Principles

The guiding philosophy of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt is encapsulated in its namesake, the maxim "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." Drawing inspiration from a variety of esoteric and philosophical traditions, the founders believed that by following their true will and embracing self-discovery, individuals could attain spiritual enlightenment and live in harmony with the universe.

Central to the Abbey's teachings is the concept of Thelema, an ancient Greek term meaning "will" or "intention." Thelemites, as adherents of this belief system are known, practice a form of personal spirituality that emphasizes the primacy of individual will and the importance of self-awareness. The Abbey's teachings encourage self-exploration through meditation, study, and ritual, with the ultimate goal of manifesting one's truest intentions and living in accordance with one's divine purpose.

1. The existence of a divine, impersonal force that permeates all things, which can be harnessed and channeled for spiritual growth and transformation.

2. The belief in a divine blueprint for humanity, known as the "True Will," which is unique to each individual and can be discovered through personal exploration, reflection, and experimentation.

3. The idea that the universe was created through a combination of divine will and human intention, providing a framework for understanding the relationship between individual and cosmic purpose.
