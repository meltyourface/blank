## Title: The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt - History, Teachings, and Practices

Introduction

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt is an esoteric and occult institution deeply rooted in the principles of individual freedom, self-discovery, and the divine nature of willpower. In this section, we shall delve into the history of this prominent organization, while exploring its core teachings, main practices, and rituals. Furthermore, guidance will be provided for students eager to embark on this unique and transformative spiritual journey.

### I. History

The establishment of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt can be traced back to the early 20th century, founded by the English occultist and mystic known as Aleister Crowley. Often referred to as the 'Wickedest Man in the World,' Crowley was a pioneer in bridging the gap between Eastern and Western esoteric traditions. The Abbey, which was built in Cefalù, Sicily, in 1920, remains a sacred site dedicated to the study, practice, and advancement of the spiritual system called Thelema—a Greek term signifying 'will' or 'intention.'

### II. Core Teachings

The fundamental teachings of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt are based on Crowley's primary philosophical principle, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. Love is the law, love under will." These words emphasize two key concepts: the True Will and the Divine Will.

a. **True Will**: The True Will represents an individual's inherent purpose and ultimate life path. It transcends mere desire and rests on self-discovery, aimed towards the greater benefit and fulfillment of the innermost self.

b. **Divine Will**: The Divine Will underscores the inseparable connection between an individual's True Will and the universal current of cosmic energy and consciousness. In short, pursuing one's True Will brings one closer to harmony with the Divine Will.

### III. Main Practices and Rituals

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt incorporates various practices and rituals designed to assist practitioners in the realization of their True Will and attainment of spiritual enlightenment. **Some key rituals include**:

a. **Liber Resh**: A foundational ritual performed four times a day. It involves invoking the four elements (Air, Water, Fire, and Earth) and their corresponding Egyptian deities (Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and Hoor-paar-kraat) to align oneself with the natural rhythms of the universe.

b. **The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP)**: Aimed at cleansing and purifying one's spiritual environment, the LBRP is a fundamental practice employed for establishing a sacred space before commencing other magical operations.

c. **Middle Pillar Exercise**: A technique for balancing and channeling the life force energy within oneself to stimulate physical well-being, emotional equilibrium, and spiritual growth.

### IV. Continuing Education and Application

For students interested in pursuing the wisdom and practices of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt, several avenues are available:

a. Seek out knowledgeable mentors or join a local Thelemic organization to learn directly from experienced practitioners.

b. Engage in independent study by delving into the vast array of texts and literature on Thelema, including Crowley's foundational texts like "The Book of the Law" and "Magick in Theory and Practice."

c. Dedicate one's life to the path of personal growth, spiritual development, and the pursuit of one's True Will through disciplined practice, study, and introspection.

In conclusion, the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt is an institution with a rich history, rooted in the pursuit of individual freedom and spiritual growth. By understanding its teachings, engaging in its rituals, and seeking guidance from the initiated, students of the occult can make great strides in their quest for self-realization and the manifestation of the True Will.
