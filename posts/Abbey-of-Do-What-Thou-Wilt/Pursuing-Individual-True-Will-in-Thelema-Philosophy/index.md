The concept of individual will and the pursuit of one's true purpose unhindered by external influence.

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt emphasizes the importance of personal freedom and the pursuit of one's individual will as the primary guiding principle within its esoteric doctrine and educational approach. This concept is derived from the teachings of the famous occultist Aleister Crowley, who founded the religious philosophy known as Thelema.

In Thelema, the central tenet is the realization and pursuit of one's True Will, which can be understood as one's higher purpose in life, divinely inspired and aligned with their innate desires and talents. By pursuing the True Will, individuals can develop a deep understanding of their own nature, leading to self-discovery, realization, and personal growth.

Crowley's famous phrase, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," encapsulates this core principle. It does not mean that one should indulge in hedonistic or harmful behavior without consequence; rather, it urges individuals to embrace their True Will and follow it passionately without outside interference or the constraints of societal expectations and norms.

This principle stands in stark contrast to the first two options, as it places the onus of spiritual development on the individual rather than on adherence to traditional forms of discipline and doctrines found in other religious systems. Moreover, it encourages personal exploration and self-development above adherence to societal norms or established institutions.

The pursuit of one's true purpose in Thelema does not prioritize material wealth or power over others, as suggested in the fourth option. Rather, it focuses on personal growth, self-awareness, and spiritual advancement. While material success may be a side effect or an aspect of an individual's True Will, it is not the ultimate goal or driving force behind the teachings of the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt.

In conclusion, the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt emphasizes the pursuit of individual will and self-discovery as the primary guiding principle in its esoteric teachings and educational approach. This is based on the Thelemic philosophy founded by Aleister Crowley, which encourages individuals to uncover and pursue their True Will, leading to personal growth, spiritual realization, and a deeper understanding of the self.
