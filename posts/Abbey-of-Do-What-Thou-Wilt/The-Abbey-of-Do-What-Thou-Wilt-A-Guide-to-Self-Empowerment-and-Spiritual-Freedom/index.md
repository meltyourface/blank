The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt: Philosophy, Practices, and Core Tenets

In the realm of the occult, the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt stands as a beacon, illuminating the foundations of personal empowerment and spiritual freedom. While its history can be traced back to the early 20th century, its core principles and practices have attracted adepts disillusioned with more dogmatic paths, yearning for self-discovery through a tapestry of mystical experience and sacred knowledge.

Historical Context

Founded amidst the tumultuous era of the early 20th century, the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt represented a radical departure from traditional mysticism. Its inception was largely influenced by the groundbreaking work of Aleister Crowley, a key figure in modern occultism and Thelema- a system of belief premised upon the pursuit of one's True Will as the ultimate purpose in life. This unique philosophy attracted followers dissatisfied with conventional religious structures, and thus laid the groundwork for the Abbey's enduring legacy.

Philosophy

At the heart of the Abbey's teachings lies the central tenet: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This deceptively simple maxim encapsulates the fundamental principle of spiritual sovereignty. An individual's True Will, or intrinsic purpose, transcends the superficial constraints of societal expectation and moral dogma. By realizing and actualizing this Will, practitioners are able to attain inner harmony, unlocking the full potential concealed within their divine essence.

To aid in the quest for the True Will, the Abbey emphasizes self-exploration through myriad techniques, encompassing both esoteric and exoteric domains. Meditation, visualization, and divination serve to expand consciousness and attune the practitioner to their inner wisdom. In contrast, the dissolution of the ego is studied through ritualistic practices and ecstatic experiences, granting a glimpse into the boundless realms of divine mystery.

Core Practices

In service of the True Will, the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt prescribes an eclectic array of practices aimed at refining the body, mind, and spirit. Among these are various forms of ritual magic, such as invocations, evocations, and astral travel, which enable the practitioner to harness unseen forces and commune with ethereal beings. Simultaneously, an emphasis is placed upon the contemplative arts, such as yoga and qigong, to fortify the body and foster energetic balance.

Another cornerstone of the Abbey's curriculum is the study of arcane symbols and languages, including the Kabbalah, Enochian, and Tarot, thereby granting initiates a more profound comprehension of the underlying matrix of existence. By mastering these esoteric systems, one gains the keys to unlock hidden dimensions and manipulate reality in accordance with their chosen path.

Key Figures

Although Aleister Crowley remains the most iconic figure associated with the Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt, an array of influential individuals have contributed to its rich lineage. Among them are Frieda Harris, who collaborated with Crowley to craft the Thoth Tarot, and Austin Osman Spare, whose philosophy of 'Neither-Neither' and sigil magic are central to the Abbey's ethos. These visionary individuals have each played a role in shaping the ever-evolving tapestry of spiritual knowledge that forms the basis of the Abbey's teachings.

In Conclusion

The Abbey of Do What Thou Wilt offers sincere seekers a unique path towards self-realization and spiritual growth. By embracing the central tenet of the True Will, practitioners are guided towards the hidden depths of their being, uncovering the latent mysteries concealed therein. Through the study of esoteric practices, arcane symbols, and transformative experiences, they emerge poised to embody their fullest potential, living as true custodians of their sovereign destiny.
